music neg 241.txt i bought this album because i loved the title song . it 's such a great song , how bad can the rest of the album be , right ? well , the rest of the songs are just filler and are n't worth the money i paid for this . it 's either shameless bubblegum or oversentimentalized depressing tripe . kenny chesney is a popular artist and as a result he is in the cookie cutter category of the nashville music scene . he 's gotta pump out the albums so the record company can keep lining their pockets while the suckers out there keep buying this garbage to perpetuate more garbage coming out of that town . i 'll get down off my soapbox now . but country music really needs to get back to it 's roots and stop this pop nonsense . what country music really is and what it is considered to be by mainstream are two different things .

camera neg 715.txt in my experience , this camera takes great pictures , but the zoom lens is so delicate that it breaks easily . it stops extending and just makes a clicking noise . this happened to me when the camera accidentally turned on while in my pants pocket rendering the camera unusable . my brother and two of my friends experienced a similar problem with their ex-s500 after they accidentally dropped the camera while the lens was extended . i would recommend looking into another camera that is not so delicate 
books neg 120.txt first off i 'd like to tell you that this is only the second star wars book i 've ever read , ' jedi search ' being the first . i actually liked the first book , it drew upon the star wars lore well and was a decent read . however , this book made me groan in so many places that i felt almost compelled to create an account here to have a little rant about it ( be warned , this may contain a few spoilers ) . thusly : how much of the book was wasted with overly long descriptions ? it reminds me of a ' little britain ' sketch where a woman author is dictating her new book and starts reading the bible out to make up the space ! i do n't mind the story being 20-odd pages shorter if it comes to the point ! for some bizarre reason the author seems to have taken every opportunity to ' ground ' the story by constantly relating to the star wars films . for example , when wedge and the scientist go to that forest-resort planet and meet the alien ambassador there , he says something along the lines of : i was actually in the cantina in mos eisley when luke met han and chewbacca , little did i know the brush i had with history there... . gahhhhhhh ! ! ! why ! ? how did he know ! ? it did n't need it ! ! *bangs head on desk* he does this throughout the two books i 've read so far ! ! how about the will to stick your own neck out and come up with something new without ' proving ' that it 's true by telling the readers that it was from a certain scene in one of the films ? then there 's admiral daala . made an admiral because of her brilliant military skills and quick thinking... . so what is she doing in this ? she 's reviewing recordings of speeches given by tarkin over military tactics and following them to the letter and losing ! it 's only the end of the second book and she 's down to 1 star destroyer ! she should live up to her reputation and at least have a few successful campaigns before the inevitable happens . ( i.e. the rebellion win ) he then goes on to waste an absolutely brilliant idea , that of having a jedi academy ( the point of the trilogy ! ) . there 's so much that could have been done here - new and original training for the jedi , but no - he has the jedi go two-by-two into the forest ( holding hands ? ) to *sense* things.. . it 's meant to be a sci-fi series ! something could have been done to make this so much better ! i was incensed to find that luke was actually made ' boring ' in this book . part of my motivation for starting to read the series in the first place was to see how luke had grown . it all started very promisingly in the first book , having learnt that luke had turned to the dark side and come through it all with the love of his friends and was now more powerful than ever ! ( cool ! i thought ) . it got to the stage where i 'd dread coming back to the jedi parts of the story because he was so dull . the other trainee jedi needed serious character development ( they were 1 dimensional ! ) - entering every scene with luke surveying them noting how well they were progressing just was n't good enough . as other reviewers have said - one of his students goes rogue , somehow gains the knowledge of building a super-lightsabre ( great idea btw ! ! we need more of that ! ) then is discovered burnt to death in his quarters.. . and luke just meditates about it ! ? *grr* okay all that being said it was ' okay ' and on the strength of the first book i will be reading the next book ( it 's like a car accident - you 've just got to look ! ) . 
health pos 80.txt this is a very good shaver for the private area . however , the key to getting the best results is to trim the longer hairs with scissors or the largest guard first . this will keep the shaver from pulling on the longer hairs and will enable the foil part of the shaver to work . the foil will not be able to do its job if the hairs are too long . the only problem i had with the shaver was that it did not enable me to shave my back like it claimed . however , i use the ' mangroomer ' back shaver for this and it is perfect for you to shave off all your back hair easily with its elongated handle . it is a great product as well . therefore , i would have to say these two products coupled together seem to cover all the bases for men 's grooming on the body . i would highly recommend both of them for perfect manscaping results

health pos 153.txt i just got my first case of this fabric softener last week and yesterday , i was walking downstairs when the smell of lavender hit me - i was surprised because i had n't sprayed any lavender freshener in the air , when i realized that my boyfriend was doing a load of laundry . like seventh generation 's lavender laundry detergent , i love this product - if you use them in tandem , not only do your clothes smell like *real* lavender ( not the chemically-based smells of mainstream products ) , but they come out clean and soft . i especially like the lavender smell for my sheets and blankets and it 's gentle enough to use on my baby 's clothes , too ! i love that it 's made with natural products and real lavender essential oil . it 's also safe for my septic system , so i 'm sold on this product . if you 're sensitive to the chemical-based scents of the mainstream fabric softeners or ca n't find one that smells good to you , try this one !

camera pos 6.txt i believe this is one of the best lens for about $1000. forget about zoom lenses even if they are l . this lens is far better than 70-200l in my opinion . it is very sharp at f2 and even more sharp at f2.5. with zoom lenses you have to set to f / 5.6 for better result and f / 8 to match this lens . it is very well built but not excessive heavy , come with hood and bag , but unfortunately , canon have decided to remove the hard cases for all the l lenses . combined with a tamron 1.4x teleconverter this lens provide very good optical quality on par with any zoom l lenses at 189mm focal length . yes i know i lost the convenience of a 70-200 zoom lens . but i am really happy that i decide to change the plan of buying a 70-200is to 135 / 2l+1.4x . this not only saves me the money but also let me to get better pictures , especially at wide open . better portrait lenses , like 200 / 1.8 and 300 / 2.8 , would cost several thousands of dollars . trust me , once you play with primes , you will not like zoom anymore . i am also using a 24-70l to shoot my small kid . after using this lens , i do n't like it anymore and thinking about change to primes someday , the only reason preventing me doing that is the 1.6x crop factor of digital camera . a 35mm / 1.4l will become 56mm which is really not good . order from amazon with free shipping even though it says not in stock . they shipped mine in 2 days and this happened before even though item stated " in stock soon " . pros : very sharp at f2 and super sharp start from f2.5. very fast lens with f / 2 very good bokeh ( background blurring ) . overall extremely good picture quality with good contrast / color . smaller size , less weight and black color compare to those white 70-200s . it is a l lens : best build quality , fast / quiet ring usm af with ftm . cons : no hard case . no inexpensive . effective focal length is 216mm on 10d / 20d / rebel / 300d which is a little difficult to use for portrait

software pos 439.txt our photo and video editing softwares were both very basic and " old " , so we decided to upgrade a couple of months ago . after reading many reviews on different bundles , we decided to get the adobe photoshop elements 5.0 premiere elements 3.0 bundle . we 've played around with the premiere elements a bit , and it 's really awesome . much better than the pinnacle studio 8 we had before . all the basic functions are easy to use and very intuitive , though we have n't gone and figured out the more advanced features yet . the photoshop elements is a wonderful tool , as well . we recently had to scan in a lot of old pictures ( as in 20+ year old b / w photographs ) . they needed a lot of touching up , and elements 5.0 worked wonderfully for that . i could adjust the lighting and sharpening , fix the colors and scratches , and the pictures turned out amazing . you 'd never be able to tell they were scanned images from such old photographs . the program is also very intuitive . i could do all the things i wanted to do without having to read the manual . of course , i 'm still just touching on the surface of what all is possible , and i plan on reading the manual and studying the program in more detail once i have the time to do so , but for what i need right now , it 's easy to use and does a good job . there are only two things i have to comment on that i do n't like about the adobe bundle , and they are the reason why i 'm giving 4 stars instead of 5. 1. the stated minimum requirements for this bundle are 512mb ram . that 's what we had on our computer , and while the program worked , it was so painfully slow that it was n't feasible to really use it . we ended up upgrading to 1gb , and it 's been working great since . so if you have less than 1gb ram , make sure you upgrade before getting this software ! 2. the red-eye fix in photoshop elements , or lack thereof . there is an auto red-eye fix , but it does n't work very well . it finds red eyes in all kinds of places , just not where they actually are . sometimes it covers half the face , sometimes only half of the eye , etc. etc. etc. there is an option to manually show the program where the red eye is , but it still does n't work right . maybe there 's another trick i have n't found out about yet , but as of right now , i usually give the fix tool a shot , and if it does n't work i take the picture back into my old editing software and fix the red eye there . i 'm really very disappointed with this , as fixing red eyes is something you have to do quite frequently when editing pictures . overall , the software has been very easy and fun to work with , even for an amateur like me . :o ) if adobe can adjust the minimum requirements recommendation and fix the red-eye fix tool , it 's going to definitely deserve 5 points

camera pos 30.txt i shoot with a canon 20d and have used the canon ef 75-300mm f / 4.5-5.6 iii usm lens . i 've always noticed the limitations of this lens when shooting amateur softball . i reviewed the lens lineup at the canon website and decided on the canon ef 100-400mm f / 4.5-5.6l usm lens . the 100-400mm is a great lens , but it can be a bit soft . for that reason i decided to add the canon ef 70-200mm 2.8 / f is usm telephoto zoom lens to my lens collection . this is a serious lens meant for serious photographers . being an l lens , there is a lot of features and is manufactured with better materials with a high level of dust and moisture resistance . the construction is sturdy and consists of 23 elements in 18 groups . the four super ud-glass elements largely eliminate the secondary spectrum reducing residual chromatic aberration . an improved 8-blade circular aperture offers a more pleasing out-of-focus image . the canon ef 70-200mm lens weighs in at about 3.24 lbs / 1 , 470 g , and accepts 77mm filters with a minimal focusing distance of 4.3 ft / 1.3 m. this lens is compatible with the extenders 1.4x ii and 2x ii . be sure to get a good quality uv haze filter to protect the front lens element . being white , this lens looks a bit strange , but helps keep it stay cool when shooting in the sun . some people are concerned that being white , it attracts attention to criminals . from my experience , my 20d attracts attention regardless of what lens i put on it . in addition , i most likely have a camera bag and tripod / monopod with me to further attract attention . i personally doubt a thief looking for something to steal is taking the time to evaluate the cost of the item and are more concerned with the ease of taking something they can unload . i try to make things difficult for would be thieves and have insurance as a back up . the dual is system has two modes . mode 1 is for stationary subjects while mode two is for moving subjects . it is recommended that the is function is not used on a tripod ; however i have used it on my monopod with success . the is helps to eliminate camera shake and helps stabilize the lens when shooting from a moving vehicle . while there are limitations to what the is can do , it can give you a few extra stops . just keep in mind , the is attempts to eliminate camera movement , not the movement of the subject being photographed . this lens permits for auto or manual focus depending on how the switch is set . there is also a switch to shift from a 1.4m / 4.6ft to infinity or 2.5m / 8.2ft to infinity . included with this lens are the tripod mount , lens hood , and storage case . the tripod mount is the best option to use when mounting to a tripod . this helps to balance the load . mounting the camera instead creates an unbalanced set up that may topple over . the case is a zippered soft case ( lz1324 ) that can also be purchased separately . the lens hood ( et-86 ) is used to reduce lens flare and can protect the front element in certain situations . often times , amazon recommends purchasing the lens case and hood , however they are normally included with the lens . the canon ef 70-200mm is such an awesome lens , it almost fails to compare to the canon ef 75-300mm . the canon 100-400mm lens is a well used option for me , but the clarity and sharpness of the 70-200mm is lens is more refined . the auto-focus is quiet and quick . this lens can be used for portraits , landscape , sports or as a general walk about lens . the f / 2.8l combined with the is makes this a good option for certain low light situations . the features add creative versatility . the canon ef 70-200mm is lens comes at a price , but it is worth every bit of it . pros : incredible clarity and sharpness quiet and quick auto-focus features add creative versatility dual is system cons : heavy and bulky ( this should be expected with these types of lenses

books neg 52.txt this book was on a very interseting topic . the author took time in studying this topic . it was about the impending world oil shortage . that is the time when we , the world , will run out of oil . it tells you about hubbert 's analysis of the time or year when the world will run out of oil . they then talk about a lot of other things like where oil comes from . then they talk about where oil is . they also talk about drilling for oil . they say it takes people over 20 drills to find oil . sometimes it will take even more time then that . then they talk about the size of oil fields . they also reexamine hubbert 's analysis later on in the book . rate plots is brought up because the more people driving the less oil we will have in the future . they talk about the future to fossil fuels and discuss elctricity and natural gases . they also talk about how much we already have so when oil runs out we need to think about all the stuff we already have . hubbert was a brilliant man . some gas companys tried to make him stay quiet but he did n't want to he told everybody . the author was ver knowledgable and i could tell he knew what he was talking about . i would n't recommend this book to anybody unless they are very smart and want to know about the impending world oil shortage . i say again the author took time in studying this topic but that was his downfall in that he went into to much depth and made it boring . when you read it you can tell the author knew what he was talking about but he got to much into detail which is very boring . i gave it a low rating because i have a short attenion span so it was hard enough for me to make it through this book

dvd pos 168.txt i 'm told by fellow film enthusiasts that buuel 's later films do not show this spanish master at his best , that his earliest films- --his famous collaborations with salvador dal , for instance- --show an edgier , more fascinating buuel . whatever . i saw his 1974 film the phantom of liberty for the first time recently , and i immediately fell in love with it . there are those who swear by his more popular 1972 oscar-winner the discreet charm of the bourgeoisie , but somehow i think the phantom of liberty is even more entertaining than discreet charm . there is no plot to speak of in phantom : this film is basically a collection of surrealist sketches that finds buuel playing with all kinds of different ideas and different images . monks pray for a woman 's sick father , and then play poker with the woman and smoke . a group of people sit around a dinner table on toilets , and go to the bathroom to eat in private . two parents desperately try to find their missing daughter- --even though she 's right there in class when they call her name . in the universe buuel concocts in the phantom of liberty , anything goes . the amazing thing about this movie is that , instead of seeming like an irrational series of surrealistic sketches , the phantom of liberty has a broad theme to support its free-form structure : it 's buuel 's comic vision of freedom run amuck . sure , the idea of liberty is appealing to everyone...but , as buuel seems to be suggesting , even freedom has its limits . the opening scene of the movie is set in toledo , spain in 1808 , as napoleon 's troops attempt to liberate the spanish and are greeted with cries of " down with liberty ! " there can be times when we want the assurance of authority , rather than the freedom to act in whatever way we please . buuel does n't take a stand one way or the other , really ; he 's just an artist who is intrigued by the idea , and his interest fuels the free-form structure of the film , and its content . almost anything and everything he can think of- --within the bounds , i suppose , of the same themes he covered throughout his long and illustrious film career- --is thrown into this movie , and while some viewers may perhaps prefer the comfort of a movie with some structure , i found its elegant chaos exhilarating . only a master filmmaker who had absolute confidence in what he was doing would dare make a movie like this . i think buuel pulls it off triumphantly here ; somehow , he makes the movie seem almost logical , the way it progresses . the phantom of liberty is a sheer delight . highly recommended

dvd pos 215.txt having visited st. petersburg , russia a year ago , i could not pass up the chance to watch this movie . i must say , it was nicely done . i can relate to the obnoxious , business like brother...who happily did not go with me on my trip . i was more like the care-free younger brother , but not quite so care-free as the character protrayed . the scenery was awesome...all the fantastic architecture of those magnificent buildings and sculptures were in the movie...although i wish there were more because the city is full of beauty . and this goes for the women as well ! ! i mainly went to see the city...but i also went there as a very confirmed bachlor to meet a lady that i planned would be my travel companion . what i did n't expect was to really fall in love : - ) . the big reason why i confirmed myself to be a life time bacholar was my exposure to american women...as if explained in the additional extras on the dvd...but the russian lady that i met there and the culture of her up-bringing quickly changed my way of thinking ! ! one thing i should add though . the movie gave the impression that you can take her home with you when you go back to the states yourself . such is not the case . it takes paperwork and a lot of patience to get her here...expect at least 8 months , but it is more like a year . it is time consuming to get her a us visa . but she was worth the wait for me and if you want a life long partner and lover , the wait is worthwhile . another word of caution : prepare yourself to fall in love with russia...the people are very nice and i know of a lot of americans who go there quite often to visit and re-visit...some even live there now
music neg 407.txt just like in my other review i ca n't figure out the madness over these guys . i will ask in this post as well for somebody to actually explain to me why they should be heard and are relevant in a creative way . honestly people you ca n't call these guys artists . an artist creates something from a idea or two these guys take those ideas and just lump them together . it 's as simple as that . and to top it of they do n't have the chops as musicians to be relevant in that form either . a comment like " they rock " or " the lead singer is soooo hot " are n't examples of a great artist or band . from the dates of the last post my words might be in vain , kind of like the validity of this record . because there has n't been a post on here for two years . if a fan of banking benjamins does stumble upon this post i invite you to check out my other reviews , and checkout some relevant and great music
books pos 46.txt this book , styron 's finest , is about redemption . heralded by the epigraph from john donne , the intricately structured tale with its marlowian manipulations of narrative points of view soon becomes so enthralling that it 's impossible to put down . but it 's also to styron 's great credit that the novel 's theme , redemption through confrontation with death and violence , is reflected through its feverish style . there are not many books in the postwar era , and none in the united states , that have such a non-moralistic but intensely moral character and impact . echoes of the greek tragedians ( several times evoked in the text ) and of dostoyevski abound . finally , the crucial role by the most-fleshed out non-expatriate character , a philosophical italian small-town cop named luigi , elevates the moral drama to a metaphysical dimension that most contemporary writers do n't even seem to understand , let alone approach . it 's a shame that styron has not received the nobel prize yet

dvd neg 59.txt the casting for this production could scarcely be better ( of particular note is the harrowing performance of judi dench ) and it 's one of shakespeare 's best plays . that said , this film of a production on stage does n't quite carry the viewer 's interest for the entire play . there are times when the actors seem downright pretentious ; you feel as if they 're tellings us , " we know how deep this is so appreciate it , please . " that 's too bad since " macbeth " is a work thriving with intense imagination with a few hallucinations thrown in so it should invite a great film . sadly , this relatively slow-moving production is n't it . there are , of course , wonderful moments with mackellan and particularly dench ( no one plays the scene where lady macbeth goes crazy better than dame judi ) . i just do n't know if that alone makes this a worthwhile purchase . for my money , kurosawa 's " throne of blood " is a far better choice .

books pos 852.txt i was assigned this book for a college course and was greatly surprised at its quality . blamires had c.s. lewis as a tutor , and i 've read some of lewis 's writings and have found them to be above average but not particularly special ( many people do find his works special of course ) . blamires , on the other hand , i find to be very unique - his book is top quality and very helpful . i 'm surprised this is n't a very popular book , as it ought to be . i have only two complaints , both of which are purely stylistic . first , the edition i have looks like it 's a copy of an earlier edition , which makes the text hard to read ( i got used to it after a while though ) . some publisher should take it upon themself to retype this book and republish it . my second criticism is something that ca n't be avoided - the book was originally written in the early sixties , so a lot of the examples are dated ( i.e. references to wwii , which was still in memory , also out-of-date terms like " jive " , etc. ) . however , just a few of the examples are affected by this . the book as a whole could be reasonably passed off today as a recent work , since so much blamires 's criticism of the christian mind ( or lack thereof ) still ( sadly ) applies . however , the christian mind today is being rediscovered , and the march of atheism is on the decline , with the march of religion in general on the rise . even though things are looking up , christians should keep blamires 's book in mind - not to get too comfortable with this ( secular ) world , for our real home is beyond bodily death . that we ought to have a supernatural orientation is basically the theme and summary of this book . superb book , and i really recommend this to anyone . this is definitely recommended for christians , and also for any non-christian who are curious and want to take a look at some of the problems christians have today

dvd pos 695.txt i have waited years for this release to be laser scribed onto dvd- -it is here ! a very good movie . i have to say the inspector carson ( belonging to an unknown federal agency ) , character played by kurtwood smith is good if not great acting . he epitomizes the sort of corrupt fellow we all love to hate . his lines in the movie ( particularly when he and border patrol agent bobby logan , kris kristofferson ) discuss ' politics ' during a stakeout are sheer unadulterated cynicism at the nuttiest best . the conspiracy flakes have probably adopted these lines as their mantra... . great bit part acting by rip torn , roberts blossom ( as the desert rat ) , tess harper and the young and sultry jean smart . kris kristofferson does a great job with his lines and acting capacity and treat williams does ok as well . anyone who has been in law enforcement- -or any other supervisory capacity for that matter- -has seen the idiocy and vacuum headedness of the supervisor depicted in the movie of the border patrol : totally inept . the soundtrack by tangerine dream is one of my all time favorites because it fits the movie seamlessly and draws you into the scenes . a must see movie .

dvd pos 753.txt i feel some of the other reviews here are unjust and over exagerated . there were two places in the film that in total lasted maybe about five minutes where the sound was distorted , but not badly since you could still understand the characters clearly ( ex. one area had a warpy vhs noise and the second had a bit of low static ) . the costumes were well selected , but i felt a better job could have been done on the rats and the lizard ( you can see a gap where the costume ends on his face ) . this version follows the book well , though it left out a favorite qoute about the taste of the liquid in the first scene that she drinks from the " drink me " bottle . i also felt that the british accents in the movie enhanced the film . i recomend this to fans and people who are n't overly critical of films

software pos 682.txt i chose office ultimate 2007 as it seemed to not only have everything i could possibly need to run a business , but also easy functionality that would keep me from pulling my hair out because of software or design issues . ultimate 2007 certainly does n't disappoint ! - set up was fairly easy : two disks came with the package . disk one contains most of the software and disk two contains applications that guarantee that you are the owner of the software and have the right to all of the accounting and key business functions . - ribbon technology removes the old " hunt and find " menu method ( although for those of us that took the time to memorize and learn the location of every buttom and drop-down it did take a day or two to get used to the new set up ) . - integration with the web and other programs is virtually seemless . - excel is no longer the chore it once was because of the above mentioned ribbon . - accounting software is included . - ink and crossword . i 'm not one for games on my business pc , but for anyone that likes to doodle or zone out with crosswords , ultimate lives up to its name by including an art program designed for pen users and excellent crosswords . - onenote . i like post-its ( perhaps a little too much *l* ) and always used the post-it note software on my business computer to keep notes . i used onenote 2003 sparingly because i simply found the post-it note software easier to use on my desktop , but...with my tablet pc one note 2007 added a new dimension to my notetaking that i feel will work well with my business : the earlier mentioned web and application integration and handwriting to text functionality . i may still use post-it now and then for quick notes or perhaps the windows " stickys , " but the long note pages , pasting of images and other web info , and pen to paper note taking makes this product invaluable . - word . what can i say ? this is my primary software tool and i use it on a tablet pc . the 2007 applications were made for my computer type . i can easily click on formatting tools with the touch of my wacom pen and i do n't have to stop mid-thought to make a change or wait until i finish the document to then make my edits . - powerpoint , publisher , access , groove , infopath et cetera ( also included ) : i am still delving into these , but they appear to have all of the perks of the other programs . so , did i have any dislikes ? 1. the ink program does n't respond to my wacom pen as well as the windows journal or microsoft onenote . it also does n't have easy to use tools within the software . since it was an " extra " and will not be my primary desktop publishing , design , or art tool - i 'll probably remove it at some point from my tablet . 2. microsoft does not include an instruction manual or reference book with this program . as a result , after installation of the first disk and microsoft 's statement that all of my programs were installed , i could n't find my accounting software , had no idea that the accounting software was on the second disk ( the second disk , when loaded , does n't mention that the software is on the disk until after the software installation is complete and instead mentions other business applications ) , and wasted over an hour trying to find it . also , i 'm a " hands on " person and although i have access to the internet whenever i need it , i enjoy having an actual book in my hands from time-to-time while learning . ultimate is made with enough simplicity that a manual is n't really necessary ( i.e. most questions can be answered by the " help " window ) , but...for the hefty price tag , i do n't think it would have been too much to ask microsoft to include a basic " this is how you install the programs and this is what to expect " booklet . also note : athough microsoft , through their downloads e-mail updates , provided a " getting started " tab with a " how-to " for each major software applications , the tabs had to be added " after the fact " and many of you might find yourselves frustrated with the lack of upfront instructions on how to use the software . beside those few quirks , i fully stand behind my 5 star rating of this product and purchasing this product through amazon ( i.e. amazon 's pricing was less than the big boy retailers or online vendors ) . shipping turnaround with super saver : 2 days .
dvd neg 765.txt so this was the breakout movie for mira sorvino , the one that earned her an academy award for best supporting actress in 1995. this movie , and mira sorvino 's performance in it , was so bad that after it was over , i just had to find out who her competitors were for the 1995 best supporting actress category . let 's see.....according to wikipedia they were : kathleen quinlin ( " apollo 13 " - a fairly standard worried-wife-of-astronaut-in-danger role ) , mare winningham ( " georgia " - did not see this one ) , joan allen ( " nixon " - did not see , but how hard can it be to play the wooden pat nixon ? ) , and kate winslet ( " sense and sensibilities " - did not see either , but ang lee was robbed by the academy here also ) . it only proves just how few good roles there are for women in today 's hollywood that mira sorvino could win an oscar for this sort of performance . and i was beginning to warm up to her , too - she was great in " romy and michele 's high school reunion " , and terrific also in " beautiful girls " . so , what exactly is so bad about this movie ? here 's a brief list : 1. mira sorvino plays the entire movie in a high-pitched falsetto that sounds like her voice is breaking . another reviewer described this as similar to listening to fingernails on a blackboard . maybe in 1995 , because she was new , the academy did n't realize that this was n't her real voice and took pity on her... . 2. stupid plot device of the greek chorus . 3. stupid happy ending with a twist . 4. lots of profanity and dialogue that includes explicit descriptions of sex acts done in pornography movies.....while this movie is not itself a porn flick , the explicit details of the porn industry included in the dialogue definitely makes it not a movie for families to watch . 5. odd sight of a very old and wrinkly woody allen ( with dyed hair and bald spot ) making out with two women young enough to be his granddaughters.....all right , so i 'm just jealous - woody still looks gross... . 6. cliched , poorly developed characters , a plotline that goes around in circles , and lots and lots of pointless , unfunny dialogue . in summary , this movie is bad , bad , bad..... .

dvd pos 68.txt francis ford coppola 's apocalypse now is a pure example of method filmmaking . it is the true craftmanship of an essential filmmaker . the art direction , editing and sound effects are partially a small fragment which makes this film classical and memorable . what drives the integrity and semblance of the film is the storyline , acting and inner message . the inner message evidently enough is that war is hell , or in other words , hell is war . not many directors have the ambition or the true courage to establish such a well-defined piece of art . european filmmakers would n't have the slightest problem of directing the film or throw in their personal feelings about the war . what is most interesting is that an american filmmaker spoke his style and the style of the film 's collaborators through the continuance of the film . the plot is fairly simple and brief , adapted by joseph conrad 's heart of darkness . martin sheen plays the role of captain willard , a war-torn character who does not see any hope in life or humanity anymore . he has a mission and it is to capture a presumed colonel kurtz ( marlon brando ) who has fabricated an army of existensial soldiers on the outskirts of the cambodian jungle . throughout the film we encounter astonishing sequences . the most unforgettable is the dawn helicopter attacks . robert duvall 's character colonel kilgore is a steady and firm example of the basic american army brain : to search and destroy and then destroy some more if it includes yourself . the children walk about the playground , oblivious to any danger . the helicopters come into view from the dawning sea ; millions of sprinkle reflect from the water , we hear the helicopter 's engines roar from the horizon and soon enough we are stuck in a messy attack . throughout the sequence we hear wagner 's ' ride of the valkyries' . it is method filmmaking . the starting sequence is as fascinating as the rest of the movie ; a beautiful scene of palm trees blowing in the ragged wind and seconds away from being inflamed with a carpet bombing . let 's not forget the scene where the soldiers of the boat in which sheen travels in , stop an innocent upcoming boat , suspecting them to be vietcongs and carrying artilleries . then they spark off a heavy scene of shooting in which all of the passengers of the boat are pulverised to pieces with their crops and food savaged in the atrocity . this film has its famous moment , some better to be kept quiet about until they come through the screen . it does n't require any intellectual understanding , although the film is intellectually remarkable . the american soldiers in the vietnam war jumped into the land of a fresh governmental country , aiming to protect themselves and in the end only received death and chaos for their troops and for the majority of the country they were fighting against . it was a war gone mad , like all other wars , without purpose or dignity . it was a pure act of humanity : to destroy and restore their own greedy needs . this is a film in which there is no saviour , where it is hardly possible to find hope in the gloomiest corners and where all surroundings are plagued with the infatuations of greed , anger , foolishness and egoism . as coppola once said about the film : ' this film is n't about vietnam . this film is vietnam' . he was right to the date . during the current situations of the world , where they are trying to protect their own skin , the world should try to analyse this film as much as possible and wonder about what it is trying to represent . it is a film which does not ask for applause or damnation . it asks for realism . enjoy

software pos 655.txt at home , i 've been a mac user since 1991. i also have been something of a linux fanatic too and have used several distros , mostly red hat and now fedora core . at work , however i have used ms-dos , windows 3.11 , 95 , 98 and xp . it 's fair to say i have never liked microsoft . but on a laptop i use at work ( an older gateway 400vtx with a 2.2ghz intel celeron ) , i just upgraded to vista home basic . i also upgraded the memory to its maximum 1gb . and despite my years of eschewing microsoft , guess what ? i must say i really like the os . it runs fine on my slower system and i had no problems installing and no conflicts with drivers . i think microsoft has really made a " cool " os
music pos 75.txt 1978 the stage is set for an album to emerge out of the crumbling decay that is the city of cleveland . just like their other fellow ohion 's devo , the guys in pere ubu obviously saw the world in a slightly different way.i have owned this recording in various formats since 1980 and i have never grown tired of this album . i find this album to have an almost timless quality in that even though it was recorded over 25 years ago , if the original band itself tried to go back into the studio and re-record it , it just would'nt happen . there is just a certain magic that they captured in 1978 , as to the music itself i tend to break - up this album into 2 distinct parts . side one being the more accessible " drunken " side with more garage style sounds almost punk rock in its leanings guitar wise , but a little too intelligent , just listen to the lyrics.side 2 is definately the " drug " side like a bad acid trip vocalist david thomas takes you on a journey thru the seedy back streets of cleveland ( i have never heard smashing bottles sound so creepy or atmospheric ) and the rest of the band help to re-inforce this craziness by going off in a million different directions.i could give you a track by track anylisis of this record but suffice to say that music is somethig you should anylize , experience and consume at your own leisure , and then form your own opion of what each of the songs on this album mean to you . so if you loved things like throbbing gristle 's song hamburger lady then u will surely love pere ubu 's album the mordern dance.as another reviewer mentioned before black francis of the pixies fame must have almost certainly listened to these guys.i also hear there influences in recent bands such as portishead and queens of the stone age just to name a few.so if you enjoy bold experimental music that is still as fresh sounding as it was in 1978 then give your ears a chance to have a listen to this album , even if you have to beg , steal or borrow it .

books pos 657.txt ironweed by william j . kennedy was the latest selection for a book club i 've recently joined . the premise of the club is to read a novel and then view the movie ( at the group meeting ) that was based on the novel . as i expected , the movie paled in comparison to the book , despite the screenplay being written by kennedy himself . jack nicholson plays the main character ( francis ) and meryl streep is his " wanna be " socialite girlfriend ( helen ) , but this star power does n't elevate the story beyond what kennedy had already done in the novel . set during the " great depression , " ironweed is a great look at the underbelly of society : drunks , homeless , impoverished , and in that regard the story is timeless . i enjoyed the characters ' quirkiness and the loosely connected plots , but more significantly to me were the themes of redemption , forgiveness , and love . the love aspect may be hard to spot , but it is there , unconventionally , in many of the character 's interactions . this favorable recommendation comes with a warning : it can be a depressing read , definitely not a happy one , and while i found it inspirational , it will not conjure any blithe emotions . ironweed is definitely not a june beach read , being more apropos to a long winter night , indoor , by a warm fire .
books pos 395.txt in all the talk about education issues these days , it 's easy to forget that what 's really important is the relationship , the energy , between students and teacher . when the teacher closes his door and is face-to-face with thirty kids- -that 's where it 's at . it 's not test scores or textbooks or innovative curriculum- -it 's what happens between people in a classroom . this book shows that dynamic relationship between eager , active kids and a caring , active teacher . it 's not all pleasant , and successes are sometimes small , but a pervasive caring underlies it all . as a teacher , this book reminded me that sometimes the best thing i can do for my kids is to leave all that paperwork , go for a walk , go to bed early so i can be there for them the next day
music pos 752.txt i am a latecomer to the works of chopin , unqualified to comment on dinu lipatti 's technique and interpretation , but this recording gives an interesting framework to explore the waltzes . they are numbered 1 through 14 in order of opus publication , but on this disc lipatti shuffles them to form a cycle of his own devising . there are four waltzes in the key of a flat and it seems one challenge was to space them across the recital . contrast this to alexandre thaurad 's cd where he clumps like-key waltzes into groups . ( he also adds five more posthumous works . ) most of chopin 's waltzes start on the dominant , meaning either the fifth note of the home key ( the tonic , the i ) , or a dominant seventh chord ( v7 ) which leads to the tonic . lipatti uses this feature to string together his cycle . if , for instance , there were a waltz that ended on a c natural it could easily bring us to waltz no 4 , which starts on an insistent c7 chord before rising to the home key of f major . i will use this as the starting point for tracing the harmonic relationships of the tracks on this cd . track 1 : waltz no 4 in f , " grande valse brillante " - as noted starts on the v7 and finishes on f in octaves . track 2 : no 5 in a flat - begins on a trilling dominant eb , but the note it trills up to is an f ( which ended the previous track ) . finishes with a parting shot , a turn in the bass ending on ab. track 3 : no 6 in d flat , " minute waltz " - starts on ab ; the contour of the opening phrase echoes the gesture of the previous parting shot as well . ends in db. track 4 : no 9 in a flat - has two pick up notes then hits a db on the downbeat of the first measure . the right hand ends on the ab above middle c . track 5 : no 7 in c sharp minor - starts on a g sharp above middle c , which is the same black key ( enharmonic equivalent ) of the previous ab. ends in c# minor . track 6 : no 11 in g flat - starts with a pick-up turn then hits the downbeat with a db ( enharmonic c# ) . ends on a gb in the treble clef . track 7 : no 10 in b minor - starts quietly on the same note , an f# ( enharmonic gb ) . ends with a soft b in the bass clef . track 8 : no 14 in e minor - first note is the exact same b in the bass . ends in e minor . track 9 : no 3 in a minor - starts on an e in the bass melody . ends in a minor ; keep in mind that minor third of this key is a c natural - - you can hear it in the melody of the third to last measure . track 10 : no 8 in a flat - this is a side-stepping change of keys , but there is an harmonic link to the previous waltz . instead of starting on the dominant , this one begins on the major third - - c natural . track 11 : no 12 in f minor - starts on the dominant - - c again . toggle back and forth between tracks 10 and 11 and you will hear that these two waltzes start on the exact same pitch . instead of ending in f minor this waltz closes in the relative major of ab. the last three notes are a rise and fall , bb-c-ab . track 12 : no 13 in d flat - there is a leading note before the dominant . the first three notes ( bb-ab-f ) fall and rise in a mirroring gesture to the final phrase of the previous . ends quietly in db. track 13 : no 1 in e flat , " valse brillante " - another side-stepping key change but there is a connection . if you toggle between tracks 12 and 13 you will hear the same initial note , a bb - - quietly in the former , boldly here . finishes resoundingly in the tonic eb. track 14 : no 2 in a flat , " grande valse brillante " - introduction in the dominant chord , eb7. closes in ab. from here you could loop around to the beginning of the cycle again , linking the major third ( c natural ) to the v7 that starts the f major waltz
dvd neg 41.txt as part of my ongoing quest to catch up on comic book movies that i have missed over the past few years i came across this clunker . i understand , of course , that i am not the target demographic here . most comic book fans want nothing more out of their movies than authenticity ; unfortunately i was looking for an actual cinematic experience . four scientists go gallivanting around space with some chump named dr. von doom ( who wins the award for the most obvious name for a villain ever ) ; they run into trouble and are the recipients of super powers ( now we 're talking ) thanks to some chemical filled cloud . what follows is one of the most shameless attempts to buy a box office victory in history . special effects pile on top of bad special effects as the film is quickly reduced to nothing more than a dull fireworks show . we get the thing caving in the front of a semi-truck with his shoulder as the money shot , but it comes in the middle of a scene that left me mystified . an entire bridge and just about every car on it are destroyed by these four farting around with their found powers . but since these are the good guys we have to watch as they scramble to save everybody they endangered , and succeed . destruction for the fans , no consequences for the characters . but why would director tim story try anyways ? he knows the people are just showing up to ogle at jessica alba as she pretends to act . so instead of focusing on the story he focuses on making sure that those dozens and dozens of product placements make it into the frame . he should have just directed a pepsi commercial with jessica alba and saved us the trouble of watching this mess . the plot is also outwardly defiant in its interest in being even a little entertaining . instead of watching good fight evil we are stuck watching the superheroes squabble . they are n't even aware that the bad guy is the bad guy until the last fifteen minutes of the movie . they go out , show off their powers ( in things like extreme sports , you know , for the kids ) , and then yell at each other for not being discreet enough . there is also a lackluster love triangle between sue storm ( jessica alba ) , reed richards ( ioan gruffudd ) and dr. von doom ( julian mcmahon ) . i 'm sure it is real nice to believe that someone who looks like jessica alba would rather go out with a lowly scientist as opposed to the all powerful , all wealthy dr. von doom . but chances are if you 're chasing someone that looks like her she 's not interested in your kind demeanor and meaningful career . so why is my rating so high above the zero i 've been talking it up to be ? well it is what it is . it did n't put me to sleep as it washes over you fairly harmlessly and quickly . it was fun watching tv actors such as michael chiklis and julian mcmahon try their luck at a hollywood blockbuster . and at least it was n't " catwoman . " but what it was was insulting . beyond the obvious point that nobody would believe jessica alba as a scientist lies another that shows just how stupid story thinks we are . at a newsstand , on the cover of people magazine there is a picture of sue storm . now if stephen hawkings ca n't make it to the cover of people then what chance does this two-bit scientist have ? **1 / 4
music neg 738.txt first of all let me clearly state that im from atlanta and i am a diehard fan of lil scrappy and that is why it breaks my heart to tell you that this cd is garbage . besides money in the bank there are no other standout cuts and it is a shame because the underground mixtape he dropped with dj don cannon early last year was on fire , he and cannon delivered all new tracks and there were all on point , that was of course before 50 's influence which brings us to our problem . the influence of curtis jackson a.k.a 50 cent is very clear on this album . i like 50 but he knows little of the way we make records down south . if the g-unit boss would have just stayed out he way and let scrappy pick and choose his own tracks , verses etc. everything may have been fine . the guy is a control freak and as a result nobody in the " a " is pumping this and it is a shame because when scrappy is on point the boy is unstoppable . this cd is garbage plain and simple and 50 's influence is going to put the the crown prince of the south 's career in serious jerpody unless he quickly wise 's up . this is an honest review from a fan that has been down since day one.i have bought all the mixtapes and everything else he 's dropped but , im telling you if you the consumer buy this cd you will regret it and to scrappy ditch the g unit do what 's in your heart and get back to business .
camera pos 794.txt i shot my second feature ( flying tiger ) on the dvx and took it to the cannes film fest market and no one could tell it was n't film . this camera is fantastic if you shoot right . i suggest this camera over all the other similarly-priced models . we have done extensive testing with many cameras and this is my favorite . the jvc is many thousands more and you get less grain with it in dark areas , true , but for the money , the dvx , if you shoot properly with it , will get you amazing results . for proof , you can check out footage shot in a ton of lighting conditions at my site . we had the best luck in natural light , with simple chimera diffusers . if you 're honest with yourself and do n't plan on hitting the lottery anytime soon ( getting a real distribution deal / full 35mm blowup ) and you need a good looking film for fests or dvd , there is no way you should shoot on film , or another camera . we shot a full feature on no money and had many distrib offers , all because of the look this camera gave us . i 'm planning on using it again for my next film . ! viva la revolucion ! put the dvx in 24p advanced mode and rip the knob off
books neg 46.txt i was expecting this book to be a great story , but very disappointed . i cannot believe the publisher allowed the author to publish this book as it is . the book is insipid and dull , has no flow , no story , or no plot . let me present an example . i have read many insightful newsweek articles by a writer allan sloan . for example , sloan describes a sprint merger event in this way , " if talk is getting cheaper , why did mci worldcom pay $115 billion to buy sprint ? the once staid phone companies have launched a merger blitzkrieg in an effort to emerge at the center of the wired world . can regulators handle the complex new order.... . " it has a clear logical axis , and has a force to attract readers into it . but jeter describes it like this , " the merger announcement of worldcom and sprint spurred building activity around worldcom headquarters as real estate developers readied for economic prosperity . the real estate inventory swelled with new planned unit.... . " it always presents off-center , trivial detail which makes a reader bored . 70% of books are consumed to described a dry and dull fact , like " the merger of company a & b raised the stock to $x " etc. there is no insight here . but unfortunately , unlike enron scandal , there is no other book that centered on the worldcom scandal . you would get much better comprehension by collecting articles in newsweek or business week , if you have lexisnexis or ebiscohost .

dvd neg 758.txt a french saying goes : " the more things change , the more they stay the same . " it appears that the " historical " epic film of yesteryear is still much like that of today in that " poetic " license is taken to the extreme in passing outright lies and fabrications as truth . one of the things that really turned my stomach watching this is d w griffith 's emphasis at least twice during the film that he did not intend to offend any race but wanted to show historical events and yet goes on to portray outright falsehoods as truth . firstly , we all know that this cameron dude did not start the kkk and that this organisation has its roots in indiana and not south carolina . secondly , the kkk is not the defender of the south and there is no need to " purify " the race as is portrayed here the exact words used by d w is " preserve the aryan race . " modern science , using cutting edge dna research has already proved that we all come from the same african man about 60 , 000 years ago and so any racial distinctions are not only ethically wrong but factually wrong as well . like it or not , we are all related and separated only by about 2000 generations despite our seemingly outward physical differences and have a common ancestor . some of the portrayals of blacks as alcoholics and white women predators with behaviours more akin to monkeys i found extremely revolting and shocking and leaves me completely unsurprised that riots and lynchings quickly followed the screenings of this movie . yes , this movie may have been the first feature length movie that used a number of novel techniques but does this excuse the content ? this is not akin to an einstein discovering relativity folks ; every single " good " thing about this movie would have been " discovered / invented " with or without d w . eventually and very probably very soon after . every one of the techniques used would have eventually been used by any of the later , talented directors of the time . the overall lies , attempts to justify racism and the murderous kkk more than make this film fit for the dust bin than for immortality in movie 's great hall of fame . they say that racists are not born but bred ; this is why i 'm not at all surprised at what d w griffith has done here . his father was considered a " hero " of the confederate army where he served as a colonel . i 'm sure as a bitter loser of the great war , he must have taught his son his belief system and how to be a great racist . this movie has not been preserved all that well with many scenes being either too bright or too dark and the soundtrack is too loud and it 's quite irritating to have to keep hearing mendelssohn 's overtures over and over again . in conclusion , the question this movie raises is does freedom of expression mean it 's okay to make a mockery of history to further a racist directors ' world view ? also , do you buy the fact that just because this is the first movie that 's longer than an hour mean that this should be revered for all time despite its extremely offensive and destructive message ? like i said before none of the " techniques " that this film claims to have " discovered " are earth-shattering discoveries that would have required a genius to uncover anyway . so the bottom line is we have here an extremely racist and hate-inducing film that caused a lot more damage than good ; d w griffith 's legacy / mess

dvd neg 587.txt that 's all i could think of when my family and i sat down to watch this movie together . we had told the story to our children about the miraculous staircase built without nails in a small chapel in santa fe . the story itself is so powerful and moving . built in the 1870s , the chapel was nearly complete when it became apparent the choir loft stairs would not fit . the sisters ' prayed a novena to st. joseph and on the ninth day their prayers were answered when a mysterious carpenter arrived , built the " miraculous " staircase , and then disappeared without being paid . the staircase is a double helix with no visible support . it 's 23 feet tall and makes two 360 degree spirals , and the wood used is not a known wood in any area near santa fee ! this movie however is about a mother superior who has faith but harbors real resentment towards indians and also likes to curse ( how this has anything to do with the actual story i still have no idea ! ) . at one point when a nun is " shocked " to hear mother curse mother surperior responds " oh margret get off the cross and get down here with the rest of us " . when the mysterious carpenter shows up and starts to build the staircase , the architect and the contractor decide that this is a bad thing and threaten to kill the carpenter . meanwhile this carpenter who is sent by " god " builds the staircase with wood that does n't work , is arrested after being falsly accused of attempted murder , and leaves everyone to believe vandalls destroyed the staircase when in fact he originally destroyed it before rebuilding it better . in the end the staircase is built and this mother superior ( who is on death 's door ) is so moved that she literally crawls up the staircase in a very " weird " / " uncomfortable " scene until she reaches the choir loft and dies . wow , inspiring . the best thing i could think of is this director and writer took a wonderful and moving story and turned it into a hollywood flop . this was obviously written , directed , and produced by people who have no idea how the staircase was built but are pretty darn sure it was n't a miracle because hey , miracles just do n't happen . the acting was pretty good but the story was junk . unfortunately i bought this movie . if you are looking for a true inspirational movie that you can watch with your family , rent or buy mother theresa with olivia hussey . hands down the best saints movie every filmed . half way through the movie my 5 year old says out loud " wow , she really cares about everybody ! " inspirational movie , compared to this disappointment
dvd pos 513.txt truth be told , i should probably give this film only four stars because it does take a while to really get going and i think some of the story elements could have been presented more effectively . when this thing gets going , though , the descent easily attains not-to-be-missed status , and on top of all the incredible special effects , oppressive atmosphere , and grievous bloodletting ( made with a pretty limited budget , by the way ) , one of the most important plot points of the story is actually brought home in an impressively subtle manner . are you kidding me ? blood , gore , a claustrophobic atmosphere like you would n't believe - and subtlety ? how could i not give the descent five stars ? so you 've got these young british women who like to get together once a year and engage in some sort of risky , extreme activity . white water rafting , for example . everyone has fun , but then a horrible automobile accident changes the life of one of the women , sarah ( shauna macdonald ) , forever . still recovering from her terrible loss , sarah joins her friend beth ( alex reid ) in america , where mutual friend juno ( natalie mendoza ) , an alpha female if there ever was one , has staked out a cave system just begging to be explored . joining in the fun are holly ( nora-jane noone ) , juno 's new gung-ho sidekick , and a couple of sisters who round out the spelunking sextet . the movie drags a good bit as we sit and watch the girls arrive at their destination in the appalachians ( apparently somewhere in the north carolina mountains - although the movie was filmed entirely in the uk ) , then do their bonding thing the night before the big adventure . once they descend into the cave system , though , things start getting more intense fairly quickly . their first real move down into the complex of cave structures turns into quite a tight and claustrophobic ordeal , especially for sarah who gets stuck and is barely pulled to safety before the tunnel collapses . that 's when juno , a woman with more than her fair share of secrets , admits that she has led the girls into a cave system that has never been explored before , supposedly to help reunite the group . well , it does just the opposite , but they just have to keep going . if there is a way out , they 're going to have to find it the hard way . things are already creepy enough at this point . the filmmakers did an incredible job with the sets , making the viewer feel as if he / she is trapped in a real cave system with the characters . just watching these girls pull their bodies through extremely tight , dark spaces was enough to get me feeling pretty darn claustrophobic . but the real fun was just about to begin . in the wake of one of the most realistic compound leg fracture scenes you 'll ever want to squirm through , sarah spots the presence of someone or something else down there with them . no one believes her - at first . when the " crawlers " attack , though , all hell breaks loose two miles under ground . these gollum-like creatures are some kind of blind , albino humanoids who hunt by sound , can scamper and climb like monkeys , move unbelievably quickly , and really tear into whatever flesh they can find . not only are they frighteningly impressive in and of themselves , the filmmakers present them in the most effective of cinematic light . and when the girls fight back , it 's cinematic magic as the filmmakers hold nothing back in the creepy , bloody , gruesome department . and even as characters are fighting for their lives , a personal bombshell or two also drops to ratchet up the frenetic drama level even higher . the ending is a little controversial because american theatrical audiences did n't get to see the true final scene of the film , for some pretty questionable reasons . a few seconds can and do make a pretty big difference . do n't worry , though , as the dvd has both endings available . the descent draws deeply from the well of man 's most instinctual fears , making it one of the most atmospheric , heart-pounding movies to come along in quite a while . the subtlety of the story in terms of the relationship between sarah and juno is almost as impressive as the cinematography and sound work - and it even leaves room for an alternate explanation of everything that happens here . the descent has everything you could ever ask for in a horror film - and plenty more on top of that . if you care the first thing about horror , you must see this atmospheric tour de force

books pos 323.txt addressing as it does issues of cognition , language usage and acquisition , evolutionary biology and innate versus learned behavior , this work is relevant to many of the great intellectual debates of our time . it is very readable for the most part , although if some of the topics are new to you then you will find a few sections rather heavy going . more illustrations would have helped here . there are syntax structure diagrams and one very grudging , cursory sketch of the language centers of the brain , but many sections cry out for a diagram among all the verbiage . pinker 's lively , humorous style is often commented on but i sometimes found it wearing . he will illustrate a point with an amusing newspaper cutting , then list a few more , then add " i could not resist some more.. . " and so on . i sometimes wished he would just get on with it . a major problem with his nativist approach , which other reviewers have commented on , is that many examples he lists of usages that english speakers would never employ are nothing of the kind . most of them are conceivable and since the first publication of this book , linguists have been busy recording them in the field . the thesis also becomes somewhat unraveled in the penultimate chapter , where he argues that ' you and i ' and ' you and me ' are equally correct in all circumstances , because ' the pronoun is free to have any case it wants' . but if this is so then what has become of the innate awareness of correct usage that the whole theory is about ? if ' between you and i ' sounds instinctively wrong to me and ' between you and me ' sounds instinctively wrong to someone else , does that mean one of us has a mutant grammar gene ? i doubt it . the title itself is problematic . ' instinct ' is not a word much in favor among biologists nowadays and whatever language is , it is certainly not instinctive in the traditional sense . early in the book , pinker admits as much , but determines to use the word anyway , a use that owes more to marketing than to science . still , this is probably the best introductory linguistics text currently available . if you are new to linguistics , start here rather than with chomsky , but please go on to read geoffrey sampson 's work , perhaps starting with his website , to get an alternative view . as with most academic disputes , the answer no doubt lies somewhere in the middle . since chomsky 's early work , the nativists have toned down their claims considerably , while their opponents have made concessions . on page 34 of this book , pinker says , " no one has yet located a language organ or a grammar gene , but the search is on . " more than a decade later , the search is still on . good luck with that .

health neg 78.txt although i have used many electronic cuff devices in the past , this is one of the worst at providing accurate readings . firstly , the cuff is not adequate for very small or larger wrists and the readings are often lower than what you would get if the blood pressure were taken manually the traditional way . in a clinical setting , it is important that you get adequate readings so that the patient can receive the proper treatment based on their readings . it is imperative since you may or may not give medication depending on what you recive via the blood pressure measurement . i have taken a blood pressure manually after getting what i considered a questionable reading only to discover that the wrist blood pressure was far too low and more aggressive measures had to be taken because of the data that was retrieved the old fashioned way . imagine had i taken the initial reading as truth and the patient may have had a stroke as a result . as a rule , i never recommend using these devices for at home use because of the risk of false readings . many people who suffer from hypertension feel that this is a good way of monitoring their blood pressure when in actuality it is giving them a false sense of security . if you are considering buying this product for at home use or for use in a clinical setting , please ask your doctor or nurse for their opinions .

health pos 362.txt my bedroom receives an inordinate amount of morning light and , being a light sleeper , i 've tried numerous ways to protect my slumber . it does n't help that my husband ( god love him ) snores as loud as a small jet plane . i 've tried silicone ear plugs and satin eye masks only to find that the plugs make me feel like i have a head cold and the masks leave unwanted gaps that let in the light . i received the tranquility zone eye mask for a birthday present and i could hardly wait to try it . i love this thing ! it 's thick and large enough to block out all of the light and , due to the design , the mask is positioned perfectly over my ears . the sounds are pleasant ( i 'm a big fan of the " babbling brook " track ) and i love being able to plug my mp3 player in so i can listen to my own nature-sounds tracks , too . i 've given this 5 stars because there 's no option for 4.5. in all honesty , there are a few drawbacks . first , when i say this is thick i 'm not kidding . without my a / c in the summer it might get a bit warm . second , the sound clips themselves are on very short loops.. . so if you have a brain like mine that tunes in to what you 're hearing you 'll notice that the clip repeats itself every 5 seconds or so . were it not for this i 'd be a bigger fan of the first track - - the one that sounds like you 're in a forest - - but i get distracted ( and awakened ) by hearing that bird sound that comes closer then fades . even with these things in mind , i have to say i have n't slept this well in years . i love this thing , and i wish i 'd found it earlier . in fact , i love it so much i 've given it as a gift to two friends who 'd tried on my mask while they were visiting and fell in love with it , too

music pos 972.txt this collection of italian cello sonatas by the great janos starker is one of the most delightful chamber albums i own . the world renowned cellist was joined on this 1966 recording by pianist stephen swedish on five of the selections , and by his frequent collaborator gyorgy sebok on the bach sonata in g minor , which was recorded in 1963 and added to this collection to increase its length ( it is a welcome addition musically too ) . the selections here range from famous composers like bach , boccherini and vivaldi , to the lesser known corelli , locatelli and valentini . for me , the common thread of this recording is the passionate performances of starker . whether it is the happy bounce of the vivaldi allegro , the sublime rendering of the boccherini adagio , or the precise interplay with sebok on the bach sonata , starker plays masterfully and his cello is captured in rich , full sound by the mercury living presence recording technique . this is an excellent purchase for all cello enthusiasts

books neg 508.txt i 'm a wiccan who formally practices within a traditional gardnerian coven , but practices eclectically within my private practice . i read this book because i had heard that it was recommended to my local library by a christian ; purportedly , wicca 's charm was written by an impartial writer . immediately , you realize that this is n't true . catherine sanders has a clearly stated agenda : that wiccans are simply misguided and misunderstand that what they long for is offered by christianity . i could write a long review debating the merits of sanders ' arguments . instead , i suggest that you consider this if deciding whether to read this book which sanders claims to have thoroughly researched . she relies on the writings of margot adler , carol christ , starhawk and phyllis curott ( with barely a nod to scott cunningham and ronald hutton ) to draw many of her conclusions . yet , missing from her notes are such writers as the farrars , merlin stone , raymond buckland , isaac bonewits , patricia crowley , and the matthews , to name just a few outstanding contributors to neopaganism 's base of knowledge . too often , sanders relies on the statements of young wiccans she interviewed who come across as silly and naive . in another case , she bases her thesis that women 's spirituality ( e.g. , goddess worship ) is misguided and that christianity fits the same spiritual needs that women are seeking via one speech that she heard margot adler give shortly after 9 / 11. sanders requests both christians and neopagans to read her book with an open mind . a fair request . but as you 're reading , closely check out her endnotes and analyze for yourself if this book was truly researched with objectivity in mind , or whether sanders limited herself to sources that would support her belief that christianity has everything that a wiccan desires . one needs to go no further than to consider that as sanders attempts to persuade the reader that christianity has always embraced the value of women that not once does she analyze the epistles of paul .

dvd neg 400.txt i had high hopes for this series when i started watching it , though i guess the nonstop obscenities should have been the tip off that under all of that visual masterwork and spiritually stunning characterizations there lurked an twisted message that wasted ten hours of my life to discover . shandala is truly a wonderful character , pure and good , and the characterization of her is very tender , so by episode 21 or so the storyline actually looked like it could end hopeful and uplifting . oh , how wrong of me to think so , because for all of the philosophical and religious trappings , the message of " hope " the marketers promise is that the characters learn in the end that the villain 's demented plan to save the world is really more effective than their spiritualities and that the " truth " is that the emotional and physical torture and destruction of an innocent , good woman is the only way to save the world ! spare me . and if you think that i am disgusted by this message , just imagine what the muslims will think when they see what becomes of all of that quoting of the koran and the muslim character 's final opinions . although the story is technically good , i 'm only giving it one star for the message of despair .
books neg 469.txt i truly wanted to like this book . after years of avoidance i had just finished moby dick and found it not only more readable than i 'd feared but downright enjoyable . in addition i 'd heard nothing but good things about this novel whose premise certainly intrigued me , and like its predecessor it has one of the truly great opening lines in literature : " captain ahab was neither my first husband nor my last . " alas , it was all down hill from there ; overall this is one of the worst books i 've ever forced myself to finish . this came as quite a surprise because the author is no untalented hack . author of two other published novels and a short story collection , director of a university level creative writing program , long-term teacher of writing , and holder of a ph.d . in same , all to considerable critical acclaim , she should be correcting and grading ( failing ) garbage like this not producing it . so what went wrong ? how did this novel end up so awful ? the answer is brick by brick and piece by piece . there is no one great thing wrong with it but rather a lot of little things . length : if " brevity is the soul of wit " , this novel 's witlessness is easily explained . at 666 pages ( interesting number that ) this novel is about three times as long as it should have been . it would seem that , to some extent like melville before her , naslund confused length with importance , but melville was a lot more skilled at padding than she is . imho this desire to fill too many pages made many of the other problems worse by allowing naslund both to go into unnecessary detail about things no one else cares about and to repeat herself to the point of self-parody . somewhere under the barnacle encrustations may be the finely lined hull of a short novel , but this was a manuscript desperately in need of editing.. . with a meat axe or a chainsaw . the name dropping : one of the pleasures of any historical novel is the encounters between fictional characters and historical figures , but if badly handled these encounters can un-suspend disbelief and downright offend . they are badly handled here . an almost uneducated hick from the backwoods of kentucky encounters by chance a significant number of the thoughtful elites of mid-nineteenth century new england and those she does n't utterly charm with her brilliance and erudition she gets the better of as in her unintentionally hilarious encounter with naslund 's peculiar imagining of nathaniel hawthorne . one or two of these , developed at greater length could have added to the verisimilitude . as it is , it is a zelig or a forrest gump without the humor ( or the self-awareness ) . the politics : even the most conservative readers would probably find the popular views of a majority of mid-nineteenth century new englanders a bit disconcerting if espoused straight in a modern novel , so a certain amount of modernizing would be appropriate just to reduce the cringing . however , naslund takes this to the opposite extreme by having una espouse the politically correct view on every single controversy of the day ( and some that only exist in our significantly sillier day ) from slavery to whaling , from feminism to free love , from homosexuality to sensitivity towards the differently abled , all without consequence or even criticism . this latter is the most offputting because to have actually championed such views back then would have taken considerable courage whatever one thinks of the ideas themselves . una espouses them with all the negative consequences that naslund receives for espousing them today , which is to say : none . the anti-christian bigotry : there is nothing so very wrong with characters in a mid-nineteenth century novel exhibiting agnosticism or atheism as both views were gaining more and more credence at the time , but it is downright silly to suggest that such views would have been widely accepted . it is even sillier to portray christianity as something confined exclusively to the foolish , the bigoted , the future apostate , or the mentally ill . it tells us more about the author than anything else that una is openminded towards every religious and quasi-religious idea of the time except christianity . the farfetched scenarios : i sensed the novel was in trouble during the opening scene in which una loses both her mother and her baby but manages to withstand this blow by making friends with a runaway slave with whom she has a quasi-lesbian encounter... . after this the novel goes into flashback and becomes unrealistic . after her crazy christian father threatens to kill her ( a sentiment the reader will come to know and understand ) , una is raised in a lighthouse by her ludicrously liberal-minded aunt and uncle , encounters two young men who both fall in love with her , disguises herself as a cabin boy and sails on the same whaler with them , successfully avoids detection , is sunk by a whale , survives by committing cannibalism , marries the surviving young man after he goes insane , and is abandoned by him after he goes to live with the indians , leaving her free to " marry " captain ahab ( una never really " marries " anybody but of course nobody ever criticizes ) . things do n't get more realistic in the second half , which includes una 's clever and successful investment in the crazy newfangled idea of obtaining oil from the ground instead of from a whale . riiiight . the mary sue : however , the absolute worst thing about this novel is the fact that it is a " mary sue " that peculiarity of fan fiction in which a laughably idealized and practically perfect in every way alter ego of the author fulfills some basic psychological need while inducing a combination of anger and nausea in the reader . a more realistic main character might have saved it . una never learns anything from her life 's too-many-to-be-believed experiences because she already knows everything . she does n't change because she is already perfect . she does n't have to deal with the criticism of others because she does n't receive any , and she does n't have to beg the forgiveness of those she has wronged because they forgive her so easily and besides , una had her reasons ( and they were very good ones you can be sure ) . the only thing i can figure is that her publisher approved this book on concept alone without anyone ever reading it . i feel like i 've just waded through the inept scribbling of a delusional teenage girl who insists on rereading moby dick in her bedroom.. . with the door locked .
music neg 628.txt imagine buying this cd after seeing " the mirror has two faces " fully expecting the soundtrack music to the movie , and reading overall great reviews on amazon . imagine the shock of receiving the cd and the surprise of hearing 20 brief cuts of plain instrumental music out of the 24 cuts - the remaining 4 cuts contained very short lines of verse . perhaps barbara , with her tremendous unlimited wealth , felt she would be giving away a " free album " to the masses if the soundtrack contained the vocals in the film . shameless misrepresentation

dvd neg 260.txt i saw this movie and was shocked at the contents , considering that it was aimed at children . it starts out with the gypsy esmeralda doing a very provocative stripper style pole dance . while no stripping happened , there was n't much other difference in the style of dance . later in the movie , one of the men is obsessing over her in a manner i would never want my children to see . he sings a song about how she will burn in hell if he does n't have her , and meanwhile a vision of her provocative dancing is playing out in the flames of a fire . regardless of the rest of the movie , these two scenes make this highly innapropriate for children . not to mention that the story is very untrue to the novel , which had a tragic ending rather than a happy ever after one .

" soul trains a comin " ( although not a chart hit ) was missing . i would perfer the original version than the 12 inch version used for soul train from seasons 13 - " maria " ( a lackluster lp track from his latest lp , surrender ) should have been replaced with the beautiful " together always " ( from his proper sophmore lp , you & i ) . the horrible and silly " drivin ' force " ( also from surrender ) should have been out ! " lovelite " , " you & i " and " i 'm freaky " lp versions should have been on there instead of the 45 versions because they stood out very well ! ! " is this for real , " right from the start , " and " love has found its way . " were the other great ballads and jams that were non-singles but were gems as well . the absense of " soul trains a comin ' ( original ) " , " together always " , and full versions of " you & i " , " i 'm freaky " , and " lovelite " really knocked off 3 points from best of o'bryan cd and should be made into a redo ! ! for those that wasted thier money on this , " go on and cry " because right stuff records done ripped y'all off ! ! this underated talented artist ( good singer , writer , producer , and instrumentalist ) was trying to be the next prince and michael jackson but he was considered more like a 1980s version of carl thomas ( too soulful for the mainstream ) . people must have bought this cd ( if do not have original lps no more ) because more than half of the tracks are not available on other cds . i admit i love all the songs from the cd ( except for maria and driving force ) , but i will create a new cd under my productions , soul train alumni series along with my own compilations of shalamar , jermaine stewart , pebbles , jody watley and other soul train almumnis . 1. soul trains a comin ' ( original although i love the remix ; loved the keyboard fanfare on the intro ) 2. the gigolo 3. still waters 4. right from the start ( great track and catchy hooks ! ! ) 5. i 'm freaky ( full lp verison , the keyboard solo was missing from the 45 single 4 minute version ) 6. you & i ( full original lp version . loved the closing ) 7. together always ( o showed his true feelings on this 1983 track ) 8. lovelite ( full original lp version - lovelite baby ! ! ) 9. breakin ' together ( good effort and loved the video ! ! ) 10. go on & cry ( good ballad ) 11. lady i love you ( what ever happened to lovin ' your woman and tellin ' her how you feel . this was his best ballad ever and this should school young catz like bobby valentino and r kelly on real love . ) 12. you 're always on my mind ( i 'm glad they included this lp track from 1984 's be my lover on the compilation and would be good for the redo . beautiful ballad that shows a woman on how you feel although she 's seeing someone else ) . 13. tenderoni ( 45 single , i never actually heard of the full lp track before but it was a good pre-new jack single ) 14. is this for real ( great ! ! ! ) 15. you have got to come to me ( beautiful new jack ballad that should have made the charts ) this here is the real best of o'bryan plus more . wish i can add more like " i 'm in love again " , " doin ' alright " , " surrender " " love had found its way " and " shake " but had to pick the best 16 that would fit ! ! - - thank you ! !

camera pos 758.txt shooting with a dslr is great in a lot of ways , but the sensor crop kills my wide-angle capability , which , to me , is absolutely awful ! personally , i hate zoom lenses . i 've got a full set of nikon primes . and while i 'd prefer a prime lens , these zoom lenses are the only game in town for wide angle on crop sensor dslr . i like this lens because it goes wide on digital . i suggest you buy this lens for the 10mm and keep it at 10mm because the 10mm wide end is really where it 's at and the reason to buy this lens over the alternatives . for anybody considering 10mm vs 12mm at the wide end , unless you mostly use the narrower end of the focal length most of the time , 2mm is a significant difference in field of view on short lenses . as the focal length increases ( eg , from 400mm to 600mm ) , the difference in angle of view is not very large . but the difference between 10mm is 12mm even though " only 2mm " is no laughing matter , and if you do n't believe me , you can do a comparison in a camera shop to prove it to yourself . if you end up deciding to get a 12mm , you want to buy the sigma 12mm ( i think it is 12-24mm ? ) because that lens covers full 35mm frame ( and the angle of view has got to be absolutely amazing ) ! also , if sigma or nikon reads this review , please make an 8mm or 9mm f2.8 rectilinear crop sensor prime ! and if sigma reads this review , i want some f1.2 or f1.0 afd primes ! 50mm for film maybe even a digital sensor version in some medium range focal length ! i would definitely buy ( full frame coverage of course ) a mid length and a medium wide angle and a short tele ! neither nikon nor canon makes anything like that ( well , canon kind of does / did ) , so you 'd have the market segment dominated

dvd pos 221.txt i lived through the vietnam era . if you did you ca n't ever forget . this guy was right in the middle of the crucial decisions that brought the debacle down on us . here he sifts through the sands of his memory and tries to synthesize how it went wrong , why it went wrong and what we can learn to keep from repeating it . for me , here was the most unforgettable moment . decades later he returns to vietnam and winds up sitting at a formal dinner next to his north vietnamese counterpart from those days . macnamara tells him we- -the americans- -were not a colonial power seeking to impose our will but were fighting to stop the spread of communism , seeing north vietnam as a tentacle of communist china . the north vietnamese official gaped at him and then began pounding the table and said , " mr. macnamara , you must have never read a history book ! we 've been fighting the chinese for a thousand years ! we are n't their puppet ! we were fighting for our national freedom ! we would have fought to the last man ! " macnamara says they almost came to blows . here 's the point . macnamara says , as compared to say the soviets , we did n't understand the north vietnamese . we did n't really know enought about them . we had no idea what was in their minds . and that was why we wound up fighting the wrong war against the wrong country and for the wrong reasons ! that 's why we lost ! does any of this sound familiar ? ? ? ? ? ? this is a fantastically good piece of work that ought to be required viewing for every american of voting age . it 's that good and that informative . of course , it wo n't be widely viewed by the american public . we 'll go our goofy way coveting our big-screen tvs and gas guzzling cars and spending our time on important things- -like sporting events

camera pos 124.txt i started with a d50 and have loved it from the very begining . i felt ready to step up to the next level , but did n't think i was ready for the d200. when i heard about the d80 , i read everything i could . the biggest selling point was the fact that it was the same internal workings as the d200 in the more consumer friendly d50 body . i do n't use all of the mode setting and find myself in shutter and aperture priority most of the time , but it 's nice to have the others there when i do n't want to think about or have time to fiddle with settings . the in camera image enhancements are amazing- -but a word of caution . vivid +2 will definitely give you vivid shots- -if not too much so . i 've had this baby for about 2 weeks and imagine it will be my camera for the next couple years . compared to the canon 30d ( which i was thinking about ) or even the new 400d ( i have n't actually held one yet ) , this is the nikon to have . on batter life , i had a recent shoot where i took over 800 shots in a 3 hour period . the battery was at about half and that 's with quite a bit of lcd viewing . at this level both canon and nikon offer great equipment- -you ca n't go wrong with either . just get one of each in your hands , snap a few shots , and go with the one that feels the best for you

camera pos 136.txt i just bought a digital rebel about a month ago . love the camera , my old 380ex speedlight integrates with the camera but just does n't offer enough cycle speed to keep up with continuous mode on the rebel . this flash does the job for the rebel and the plug for the external battery pack promises even better performance once i grab that item . another big selling point that really makes this unit worth the cash , is that it has its own infrared focus assist lamp which the digital rebel lacks . when this flash is mounted on your digital rebel , you do n't get that annoying set of quick flashes that the camera has to set off to focus in low light when using the built-in flash . the rebel body uses the infrared focus assist on the 550ex to focus the lens ; this feature alone is worth the big bucks this baby costs . the flash has tons of features that most of us might never use , but as a advanced amateur i 'm glad they 're there so i can play with that if i should choose to try out some fancy stuff . the wireless slave capability is handy but you 've got to have at least one more 420ex , 550ex or 580ex to use that . i like the digital readout on the back of the flash and also the two way bounce head , it 's important to note that you have to press a button to make the head turn either side to side or up / down- --this should make the head sturdier than i 've seen on some units that get loose after awhile and drive you nuts . this unit is a honker- -really big , and , no lightweight either . get yourself a big deep camera bag if you want to lug this thing around with you . what 's the difference between this and the 580ex ? the 580 has very slightly faster cycle times and offers some fancy new automatic flash exposure bracketing modes , for me anyway it was n't worth almost two hundred dollars more for the 580. all of the newer eos camera bodies are fully supported by this unit , it also works on older eos bodies but there are functions available on the newer ones that are n't there on older stuff . i like this flash it covers well , cycles fast and the controls are fairly intuitive and easy to use . when you get yours do n't lose that book , canon does n't seem to have them online anywhere i can find and i 've seen places that want to charge you 18 bucks for a new one

books neg 727.txt as a dad , i was really looking forward to a book on potty training to help me with my 2-year old . this book is lousy though . why ? 1. stupid writing . i got pretty sick of constantly reading all the sappy , " witty " remarks . " dancing the potty mambo " ? give me a break ! 2. stupid advice . this book keeps telling you to talk to your kid like he / she is an adult . i 'm sorry , but a 2-year-old just cannot comprehend a long drawn-out explanation of why you want them or do n't want them to do something . how about just saying , " do n't do that ! " or " hey , you want to try this ? " that seems to work just fine for me . why give your kid a doctoral dissertation every time you want them to do something ? what 's wrong with just telling your kid what to do ( nicely ) , and expecting them to be obedient ? 3. repeating content . this book kept repeating itself over and over . okay , i got it already ! i strongly feel that the author wanted to push this book over the 200-page mark when all that needed to be said could probably have been accomplished in about 50 pages ( or less ) . 4. too many references . this book constantly refers to other chapters . i once counted 6 different references to other chapters on one page . i am not kidding ! huh ? is potty training really that freakin ' complicated ? all i want is some general ideas on how to go about it , how to get started , and a few good tips . i do n't need all these detailed references . ( nor do i need the phrase " potty mambo " repeated to me ad infinitum . ) here is all i wanted to know : -how do i get started ? -what do i do ? -how often do i need to try it ? -should i go for pullups or just keep him in diapers for the moment ? maybe this book got to all of that , but i quit after page 60. i just could n't take it anymore . after hearing the phrases " stay positive " and " potty mambo " repeated to me for the umpteenth time , i had to quit . i returned this book and got my money back . if i were to say anything good about this book , i would say that it has a few good tips , surrounded by about 180 pages of filler . potty training still looms ahead . will i be successful ? probably . but to this book i say , no thanks
software pos 886.txt coreldraw was my first foray into vector graphics back when version 3 showed up on my desk at the small " mom and pop " screenprinting shop i worked at . back then , corel came with oodles of free fonts , clipart , manuals ... not to mention free technical support via a toll-free number . i stayed with corel exclusively until version 10 ... enduring countless patches , bugs and the dreaded " odd-numbered " curse ( if you tried version 5 or 7 , you feel my pain ) . adobe photoshop was always my photo-editing program of choice ... corelphotopaint just never quite " did it " for me . industry demands eventually delegated that i delve into adobe illustrator . being already familiar with adobe photoshop 's features , tools and " look and feel " , illustrator did n't present a huge , overbearing learning curve . in illustrator , i found the same robust features as coreldraw ... which was n't what impressed me about illustrator . adobe 's intuitive programs , and their ability to interact with one another ... seamlessly ... that is what won me over to illustrator . illustrator 's ability to edit / create pdf 's in their native format ? wow ! exporting layered vector files to photoshop ... with layers intact ? ? ? wow ! ! ! ( i could go on ) now , that being said ... there are still things that i prefer in coreldraw compared to illustrator . the extrude function in corel is much easier to utilize . the powerclip function is more user friendly than illustrator 's " make clipping mask " function . the ability to customize / edit / add shortcut keys is an amazing feature . ( again ... i could go on ) in regards to importing and exporting files from other applications , coreldraw wins , hands down . it boasts a robust set of import and export filters , my favorite being the .eps import filter which lets you import an .eps while converting the fonts to curves during the import . this is a must have if you work with an .eps file created on another computer whose fonts you lack . if i had a dollar for every .eps that pulls into illustrator with fonts blown out ... i 'd be independently wealthy . why illustrator has never implemented this is beyond me . so , to sum it up ... coreldraw is a great program ... but i ca n't imagine it being my only vector drawing program . just like in real life , you need a great team . this program , paired with adobe creative suite , meets my needs perfectly .

software pos 167.txt this is a good software for casual use ( hiking , biking , geocaching ) , but not without issues . on the positive side , it definitely beats all non-digital ( scanned usgs maps ) alternatives . the level of details is good enough ( how many of us need to know topography down to 5 feet ? ) . the fact that maps are digitally generated ( with vectors i believe ) makes all the labels clear at any scale . it has two advantages over its main " digital " competitor , ng topo . first , all of the us is on one dvd for the price of separate state / region cds from ng . and second , it is available . i could not even find ng 's northeast edition anywhere on the web ! one might think nh and me are some obscure corners of the globe and not big tourist destinations . now the few negatives . the exchange feature with gps is flaky . sometimes it takes several tries of unplugging and replugging the cable and restarting the program before it recognizes my garmin . part of it could be that low and mid range gps still have serial connection and are not truly plug-and-play even with com-to-usb adapter ( beats me why garmin ca n't make all their gps with usb in this day and age ) . in any case , regardless of whose fault it is , it is annoying at times not to be able to connect the two smoothly . the second problem i noticed was with the 3-d window . it clearly consumes a lot of memory and crashes my laptop if i do a lot of rapid rescaling . i ended up just closing that window , since it is pretty much for " coolness " and does not add any real topographical value . finally , i had a problem with delorme 's service . i purchased it from amazon with a rebate offer . however , a month after submitting the necessary info i received a card from delorme stating that the bar code i sent was not a upc code . the box only had one bar code on it so i am not sure how i could have made a mistake . they requested that i send a correct one , but with the code cut out and gone , how do they expect me to come up with one ? ! i feel a little bit like that was a cheap way out of paying the rebate but $20 is not worth the time arguing with them over it . i would be interested to hear if anyone else experienced the same problem .

books pos 784.txt moral consciousness and communicative action is the primary anglophone source for habermas 's writings on & quot ; discourse ethics . &quot ; written in the early eighties , this translation , which was published in 1990 , provides a developmental perspective . the focus of the essays moves from habermas 's statements about the role of philosophy today , in & quot ; philosophy as stand-in and interpeter , to his writing on reconstructive social science in general , to his program for a discourse ethics in particular . the final papers address criticisms of this program . the volume suffers a bit from the fact that thomas mccarthy 's introduction is keen to locate habermas 's position vis a vis various contemporary moral-philosophical standpoints , but does not go very far toward locating the whole initiative in the broader canvas of habermas 's overarching social-theoretic project

camera neg 685.txt the me-1 provides a modest 1.2x magnification for viewfinders on olympus 's e-300 and e-500 cameras . ideally , this would allow sharper manual focusing and more precise framing . unfortunately , this did not happen when i used the me-1 to make a number of trial images with my e-500 , so i will be returning the me-1 for a refund . ( for the record , i wear prescription eyeglasses while shooting , with my " shooting eye " corrected to 20 / 20 vision . ) like other folks , i find the e-500 viewfinder a trifle small so that it 's not always easy to frame a shot and see exposure data at the same time . the camera must also be pressed against your face when framing , which is not always comfortable . in some ways , the me-1 created more problems than it solved . the me-1 kept the camera further from my face ( though it seemed to bump harder against my glasses ) , but at the cost of *narrowing* my angle of vision in the viewfinder . divide the viewfinder into four equal columns and rows so you have eight squares . the four squares in the middle of the viewfinder were easily visible , but those along the sides , top , and bottom were *less* visible than before , the corners considerably less . to frame a shot , i had to move my eye around the viewfinder much more with the me-1 than without it . to see exposure data , i had to shift my eye almost completely away from the image . more hassle than i need when shooting in the field . fortunately , there is another option that works for me . the e-300 and e-500 come with an ep-5 eyecup , which is definitely too small for my taste . but a larger eyecup is also available , the ep-6. the ep-6 keeps the camera a little further from my face . and with the viewfinder diopter properly adjusted ( a critical step no one seems to mention ) , the ep-6 allows me to see both the entire image and exposure data without shifting my eye very much at all . all of this will vary from person to person , of course , and there may be circumstances when the me-1 is exactly what 's needed - - so two rather than one star . but not in standard shooting conditions , especially if you need to compose , set exposure , and shoot quickly
dvd pos 784.txt this is a film like none other you have ever seen , and as such you 'll either love it , or hate it . from the " reviews " posted on amazon , i 've come to the conclusion that the people who hate it are simply people who do n't have the intelligence to have understood a word of it . this film is not literal . learn to *think* about what you are watching . to interpret archetypes , symbolism and metaphor . a clue : the lady character is named story . now why might that be ? and why would she require a vessel before taking flight into the world ? and what precisely does the wolf-like scrunt represent ? and why are there three of those monkeys ? this film is a love letter from one creative person to all other creatives in the world . if you are n't an artist , you probably wo n't get it at all , and might even post a scathing review of it on sites such as this . but that achieves nothing but illustrate how stupid you truly are to the artistic souls that will understand everything this film says , and love every beautiful , unique and visionary second of it . magical .

music pos 167.txt wow ! there 's sooooo.. . much to like in this album it 's amazing . the music is mostly upbeat & very catchy- -making you want to ( & will if no one 's around ) sing along . the lyrics are fine , meaningful , & personally touching- -about life which is getting faster & faster in the contemporary world , while people are still people with hopes , feelings , needs , desires , & all the rest of what makes people human . the lead singer , jennifer nettles is powerful yet gifted with a sweet voice ( though a bit twangy in style ) . she grabs you quickly for a wild ride- -immersing the listener in the musical story she 's telling . i bought the cd based on hearing baby girl & something more ( on the tv show vegas of all place ) . then i heard sugarland on the cma show- -winning awards as they so deserve . the range & variety of the songs on the album are good too- -from sweet & poignant ballads to wild & spicy soaring . virtually all of the songs are well worth listening to & the majority could become successful singles . yes , the style is their own mixture of influences- -the 3 artists come from different musical backgrounds , which makes their wonderful blending are the more impressive . and , the trio wrote all the songs on the cd- -with hall the primary author ( solo writer on one of them ) . how many trios are there with 2 women & 1 man ? i wonder if they are unique ? well , they are unique even if not in that respect- -how many bands include a mandolin ? . of course , country purists may not be happy with them , but the vast majority of listeners are . this has become one of my favorite albums , at the speed of sound . imho , it 's terrific

music neg 823.txt the lady can sing , but her " christian " message is compromised because of her part in " chasing papi " , where she played a woman who - had she had the chance - would have hopped into bed with her on-screen boyfriend prior to marriage . it 's " crystal clear " to me that jaci broke my heart in a million pieces when she played that part . it 's really tragic to see such a beautiful young lady with such a opowerful voice and message now reduced to nothing more than a hypocritical wannabee , much in the same way that stacie orrico is now becoming.....and is it just me , or is it coincidence that these two womens ' album covers look strikingly similar ? it appears their paths in life are similar , too : compromising a message and a stand that once set them worlds apart . as with a recent review of orrico that i made , i 'll give jaci velasquez her due : she can sing , and what i mean by that is sing the roof off of a house ! this album was excellent.....was . now , whenever i think or hear of jaci velasquez , i can only think one word : hypocrite

health pos 862.txt i found this product after reading a review of it on hairboutique.com . the length of my hair seemed to have reached a plateau just below my shoulders and after year seemed to have grown no longer . i decided to try this product to see if it worked . as hair growth is normally clocked at an 1 / 8 of an inch per month , i decided to monitor the results in my own little " clinical test . " this was actually pretty easy because i colour my hair so i 'd easily be able to see how much growth there was each month . i ordered a box of viviscal for which i paid $49 for ( average price on the web ) and the was set to take the first pill the following morning ( the box recommends 2 per day ) . i coloured my hair the night before so that in one month i 'd be able to accurately measure how much growth there had been by looking at the growth since the colouring . results : i did n't really notice anything until around the 2 week time frame . i noticed my nails were growing very fast / very long . i have weak nails that split easily and they barely seem to grow at all . it was very noticeable because i use the computer all day and the nail growth was causing my fingers to constantly slip on the keyboard . never having great nails , i was pretty happy to see this . my curiosity was also getting the better of me as i could see the roots of my hair pretty clearly which was unusual at 2 weeks after coloring . i took the tape measure and measured almost 1 / 4 of an inch in hair growth . this would mean 1 / 2 inch per month and 6 inches per year . i was pretty excited because although the numbers seemed small , it was twice the rate my hair normally grows . but i also noticed something else . my hair was becoming unusually greasy . because i have very dry hair , i normally only wash it 2-3 times a week . but every other day it seemed much more greasy than normal . hmmm. well , at the 1 month time frame i measured my hair growth and it was exactly 3 / 4 of an inch . not only that but i was constantly trimming my nails at this point . i was totally ecstatic . but also by this point , i was washing my hair every day - it was no longer dry and brittle , it was much softer , but there was no way i could miss a day of washing it or it would be greasy . so - the conclusions i have reached from my test was this : 1. yes , viviscal works . it caused my hair growth to be stimulated at over twice the speed . 2. viviscal also makes your nails much stronger and grow much faster . 3. viviscal makes your hair greasy , causing you to have to wash it every day - and then it 's fine . it did not cause any extra hair growth anywhere else , which i thought a bit strange ( though good ! ! ! ) . i recommend this product

dvd pos 477.txt jean renoir 's masterpiece , ' the grand illusion ' , is truly a film about humanity - it is a universal theme , something we can all understand and relate to . the triumph of the human spirit in the most troubled times , is kind of an ironic theme considering hitler 's imminent rise to power and the ensuing war that would alter the course of history . nevertheless , jean renoir 's poetic homage to brotherhood is one of his most beloved films . it is not hard to like this movie the acting and direction are superb - jean gabin is one of the all time great actors. . jean renoir 's innovative approach would influence countless directors to come , including orson welles. . criterion did a marvelous job on this dvd - also worth getting is ' the rules of the game ' jean renoir 's greatest satire

camera neg 165.txt after reading the many good reviews here , i too bought the lenmar battery to act as a second battery for my canon digital camera . i was totally pleased with the excellent performance as many others have noted . the only difference i noticed between the lenmar and oem battery was that with lengthy continuous shooting with the lcd screen on the camera case got significantly hotter with the lenmar battery that with the oem . this was not a problem until i was shooting on a 101 degree day ( with the lenmar battery in ) and suddenly the screen went black . i could view previously taken pictures ( lcd ok ) but any new photo i tried to take was black . i read later in the manual the upper operating temperature of the camera is 104 degrees . once the camera cooled it worked again for a while , but the black photo problem continued intermittenly for a few weeks then the camera completely stopped taking photos , no matter what . so , was it the lenmar battery 's extra heat generation pushing the camera over its temperature limit and damaging the circuitry ? would it have happened if the cooler running oem battery was installed on the hot day ? i ca n't say for sure , but if you use a lenmar battery i would be careful about operating it on a very hot 100 degree day ( e.g. use the viewfinder , not the lcd since that generates heat , or turn the camera off a lot to cool down between shots ) .

dvd neg 894.txt hypocrisy alert ! hypocrisy alert ! i just wanted to get that out of the way right at the start . not more than twenty-four hours ago i wrote a review waxing philosophic on the state of the modern horror film . i argued that fans should n't viciously tear apart every movie they find objectionable because the current spate of horror films is better than no horror films at all . in other words , we should accept the bad with the good rather than stop renting and thus face a potential drought of horror movies . now that i have gotten that out of the way , i shall proceed to trash " adam & evil . " i did n't set out to heap scorn on this film when i popped it in the dvd player a few weeks ago , although a cursory glance at the cover art sent a chill of disappointment through my body and i felt my heart sinking . in fact , nothing screams " straight to video " more loudly than a film entitled " adam & evil . " well , perhaps something like " adam & the bollweevil , " or even " adam & evil knievel " might rank as likelier candidates , but you get the idea . " adam & evil " does not inspire confidence that i 'm about to watch a slasher film on par with carpenter 's " halloween . " right from the start of the film we learn the filmmakers have cast us into the ninth circle of clichéd slasher film hell . the movie introduces us to the typical bunch of young airheads getting ready to embark on a camping trip out in the sticks . there is seth ( kevin robson ) , the goofy virgin who tries too hard with the ladies but hopes that the trip will finally cure him of his unwanted condition . then there is the snotty and narcissistic brunette yvonne ( erica cerra ) . next up is a staple of every poorly made horror film , the ever important " loud guy " matt ( brody harms ) . along for the ride are evelyn ( barbara kottmeier ) , adam himself ( sean arnfinson ) , adam 's girlfriend yvette ( lynsey brothers ) , and a few other kids . i am willing to bet that as you look at this list you will notice the eve connotation in the three girls ' names , and that seth is also a name pulled straight out of the old testament . where matt comes in is a mystery unless we look to the new testament . something tells me the matthew responsible for the gospel did n't go around announcing to everyone who would listen that he wanted to be known as " matt . " call it a gut feeling . anyway , these dolts head out to the forest for a few fun filled days of gossip , drinking , and romping around in the water . sounds familiar , does n't it ? see those bright objects moving in your peripheral vision ? they 're called red flags . things get a little tense when they stop off at a local bar populated with the usual hollywood redneck stereotypes in order to ask some questions only to discover that the locals , with the exception of the busty wife of the local sheriff , are n't interested in helping out . too , a creepy park custodian stumbles into the campground and gives everyone a scare before scurrying back into the forest . if you think we 'll see him again before the credits roll , that 's one bet i wo n't take . i should also mention a couple of other potential stresses facing the group . adam and his friend matt did something quite idiotic a few years before- -namely setting a house ablaze with fireworks that claimed the lives of the family living there- -that continues to haunt them to this day . too , one of the gals worries about a stalker boyfriend she recently broke up with . both of these scenarios serve to provide us with potential red herrings in order to make the film more suspenseful . i laugh defiantly at such nonsense . i wo n't spoil the ending for you , but i will take a few seconds to describe the incredibly banal lead up to the " twist " ending . for a slasher film , " adam & evil " is downright puritanical with the red stuff . i felt like a bizarro clara peller hollering , " where 's the gore ? " every time a killing went down . seth , for example , perishes in his tent in a particularly bloodless , off camera fashion . a couple of the other kids meet their maker when they run into the killer while floating around on a raft in a pond , again a rather bloodless affair . the presence of a bow and arrows and a shed full of sharp instruments promised great things- -a promise unfulfilled , unfortunately . " adam & evil " is one of the tamest slashers i have ever seen . what did they do , turn the script over to the hayes commission before shooting scenes ? note to aspiring filmmakers : if you 're going to make a low budget slasher film that will never see a theatrical release , go over the top with the sauce . at least then you 've got a shot at making a cult classic . and another thing : make sure you pick people with a modicum of acting skills instead of the mannequins posing as living beings in this film . sure , you 'll have to shell out a few more bucks , but it 's worth it . remember , unless i 'm laughing so hard at the bad acting that the film achieves the coveted " so bad it 's good " label , ham handed performances can only hurt you . surprisingly , the dvd comes with a commentary track . not that you 'll want to listen to it , but there it is . we also get a few trailers for three other schlock films : " contagion , " " hallow 's end , " and " asylum days . " forget about picking up a copy of " adam & evil . " it 's not the sort of film a hardcore horror fan wants friends to see prominently displayed on the movie shelf . there are plenty of other worthier slashers out there that demand your attention .

dvd pos 561.txt i 'm the first to confess that i had never heard any of any of the actors starring in the 1951 robert wise gothic noir , the house on telegraph hill , but it does n't matter , because all the actors are good , and combined with an extremely effective plot , the movie is a terrific tale of murder , deceit and assumed identities in post world war san francisco . as was the fashion with many noir films of the time , the house on telegraph hill is told in flashback with a voice over from the heroine . she tells of her house that is empty and is up for sale , and one immediately assumes that something terrible has happened . however , the narrative soon jumps to germany at the end of the war , and we meet victoria kopwelska ( valentina cortese ) is a polish woman imprisoned in belsen . with her husband and family dead , victoria tells the kindly american commander major marc bennett ( william lundigan ) that there 's nothing for her back in poland . desperate to survive , victoria learns that her best friend has family in the united states , and if they are ever freed , she promises to take victoria to america with her . her friend however , is killed shortly before american troops can liberate the camp . with nowhere to go , victoria hatches a scheme to steal her friend 's papers and sail to america , where she learns now the godmother to a young boy chris ( gordon gebert ) , as well as the heir to a sizable fortune , and a gorgeously gothic house high atop telegraph hill , following the death of her " aunt . " ensconced in the ostensible mansion , victoria , now dressing in glamorous frocks and drinking expensive champagne marries the boy 's guardian alan spender ( richard basehart ) , partly out of desperation and partly out of the need for security . as victoria becomes a " mother " to the boy , she clashes with his governess margaret ( fay baker ) and coincidently reconnects with marc whom she met a belsen , now a studly a playboy type lawyer . all the adults are not as they seem : marc has been making secret plans to get his hands on the money , and victoria 's arrival causes him to draft a new scheme . victoria begins to believe that her new sweetheart is up to no good . and then there 's the margaret , the furtive outsider and whether her allegiances to chris are all they seem . the film is compelling , and tension-fuelled and beautifully shot in black and white . cortese is especially good in one of her first american roles and as victoria , she frantically tries to keep up her masquerade , yet through no fault of her own , she steadily becomes a victim of alan 's scheming . of particular note are the stunning location shots of san francisco . the main house is just beautiful and the scenes when victoria is playing baseball with chris offer stunning views of san francisco bay . the house on telegraph hill ultimately serves as one of the better noir thrillers - there 's a runaway car , poisoned orange juice , an enigmatic and jealous housekeeper and a false identity . it all makes for a gripping and entertaining film . victoria starts out as a victim , and although she schemes and lies her way into the house on telegraph hill , her ability to rise above the nefarious misdeeds enable her to achieve a kind of redemption for both her and chris . mike leonard april 06.

music neg 907.txt at no point in my following review am i by any means intentionally downing hank jr. i am just trying to give an honest review of this cd . at the time this album was realeased , hank jr. was riding high , winning big at the cma 's and acm's . he was also releasing some of the most critically aclaimed country records of his recording career . but then for some reason he decided he needed to record some rock and roll . to me this cd is a studio recorded version of a hank williams jr. live concert . the only difference is he did n't botch the vocals as he does on his live show . the music is decidedly 80% not country , it drifts towards eighties rock . if you trace hank jr. 's recording career , you can point at this cd at the one that started the downward spiral that he has only began to pull himself out of . i must say though , this cd contains one of hanks last top 10 hits , " if the south woulda won , " which is an hard to find recording on his compilations . i 'd say this cd is kinda essential collecion wise , just because of that song .

books neg 59.txt the setting of this book is beautiful , exotic , and interesting . the author , unfortunately , does nothing to take advantage of this . i am shocked that this book could possibly have won a national book award . it must mean that either the award itself is meaningless , or that there were some truly dreadful books out that year - - which i doubt . the topic of this book could have been more ably handled by just about anyone else , as far as i am concerned . i ca n't imagine it being done worse ! tuck 's writing style - - short vignettes or episodes , one after another - - is terribly ineffective and disjointed . i felt completely detached from all of the characters . i did n't feel like i gained any understanding of who they were , and was unmoved when they died or otherwise encountered tragedies . another thing that completely irritated me were tuck 's sexual references . throughout the novel , tuck would end her lame vignettes with one or two sentences mentioning some crass sexual encounter ( a finger inserted in an unmentionable place or a character participating in a masturbating contest , for example ) . these sentences seem to be thrown in just to shock or perhaps to intrigue the reader ; all they did was gross me out . they were written in such a way that they seemed to have been written by a teenage boy , not an adult woman trying to tell a compelling story . i do n't know what tuck was trying to do in this novel . i think she has failed to write anything that succeeds on any level : it is not entertaining . it is not profound . it is not educational . it is not beautiful . at only 248 pages , i ca n't say it was even a quick read . utterly forgettable , once you get past the irritation of having wasted your time reading it .

books neg 167.txt the book is well-written . most parts of it i can agree with . but there is a crucial mistake in parson 's message - - - oneness likes to play separation . i can say clearly that oneness does not play separation . duality / ego is simply a mistake / illusion caused by mind-evolution . saying that oneness plays separation is giving reality to this illusion . also , his message that we can not do anything still gives one a feeling that one is under the " mercy " of something , and this is clearly very dualistic . without ego , both doing and not doing are actions of oneness , to intentionally emphasizing not doing is a mistake . there are many illuminating sentenses in this book , but be aware of the neo-advaitan trap . in my life , it was understanding , especially of the process of ego-illusion-image helped me to come to oneness . the one who is doing the understanding is still oneness . there is no duality in doing and not doing . at right this moment , you can chose to continue to read this review or to stop . of courses , you make choices in daily life . if you really understand what is meant by " nond-duality " , you will not make such statements such as " there is no choice " .
books neg 850.txt perfectly in keeping with the imperialist ethos that he so proudly and loudly espouses , boot has foisted upon us a book that rests entirely on the labors of others . lacking even the slightest trace of shame , he plunders concepts and ideas from anyplace in the intellisphere he chooses . as a result , there 's nary a new thought nor insight to be found anywhere within these pages . even more pitiably , like a renegade third world nuclear scientist trying to " sanitize " his clandestinely-acquired apparatus of any markings that might possibly identify its source , boot assiduously scrubs away any subtleties and nuance that the original thoughts may have possessed . one wearies quickly of the manichaean results . and like any ideologically-driven but technically inept would-be nuclear ( or social ) engineer , he fails utterly in his attempt to enrich his raw material even minimally , succeeding only in rendering it more toxic and hazardous than it originally was . why , even the title itself has been purloined from alistair home 's 1977 underground classic , " a savage war of peace " ! * considering that home 's tome arrives at essentially the opposite conclusions from boot 's , this is irony most profound . it is scarcely surprising , then , that recent history has thoroughly discredited the philosophies and policies so ear-splittingly trumpeted in boot 's book , thus rendering moot any lingering interest one might have had in perusing it - - unless one wishes to take counsel for the future by ruminating upon the ozymandian ruins of boot 's espoused belief system . * recently reprinted and highly recommended !

dvd neg 191.txt this film is a perfect example of how straight action and big-name stars cannot replace the necessity of well written drama . i will not give away the plot - - although that is admittedly hard to do since there is so little of it . basically clooney 's character mr. ocean , a career burgler , is released from prison with a plan to rob the vault of a las vegas casino . so he recruits 11 men , each with a talent to add to the operation . this is where the trouble begins . the viewer is given no reason at all why he should sympathize with any of these characters . there is almost no introduction to many of them , and barely even a mention of their names . literally half an hour into the film " the eleven " are assembled and they 're already robbing the casino . how 's that for plot development ? and that 's basically it ladies and gentlemen : go to vegas , rob casino , go home , movie over . some of the " good guys " are even outright repellant . our would-be heros ' enterprise is bankrolled by some greasy hollywood tycoon . am i supposed to like this fat weasel ? the only reason we are given to sympathize at all with at least mr. ocean , is that the guy he 's robbing , the casion owner , is a really bad guy . supposedly he has people killed ' n stuff . ( this actor played a bad guy in godfather part 3 ) . but we never see any real evil deeds . in fact , he just seems like a handsome , polite , very prosperous businessman . he manages to raise his voice for just one line in the entire film . mr. ocean on the other hand , and his cohorts , are career criminals . but the guy they 're robbing is an even greater criminal , you see . so that makes it ok . and really , if you were being robbed , would n't you want to be robbed by george clooney and brad pitt ? they 're such nice guys . that makes getting robbed fun . just a couple of nice guys stealing from another nice guy . how thrilling . this entire film is a rushed series of action sequences punctuated by a few soap opera moments with julia roberts . there are a few minor things going on in the backgroung , like a boxing match , which are essentially irrelevent . throughout there seems to be vital information missing ( like say , a plot ) . soderbergh simply did a terrible job of making me care what happens to clooney and roberts . this film is also horribly cut . several times what seemed like vital plot details were intoduced , and then completely forgotten about . take the scene where pitt and a buddy are casing out the joint and the casino 's owner makes an appearence . the folder he has just been handed , explains pitt , contains secret security codes . you would think that would be something important right ? you would think they will need to get those codes . well , wrong . in fact you wo n't hear or see a single thing more about them for the rest of the movie . they introduce what seems to be an important detail and then totally abandon it without any development . and that happens all the time in this movie . in fact mr. ocean 's team gets down the secure elevator shaft and into the vault with only minor difficulties . ( and boy , they started repelling down that shaft quick , did n't they ? you did n't even know they were robbing the place yet . wow , these guys are good . or maybe steven soderbergh is as over-rated as his film . ) they make it look easier than breaking into the safe at 7-eleven . this , after mr. ocean briefed his crew at the beginning on the nearly impregnable security measures the vault was supposed to have . one would hope this film would at least end strong . but soderburgh makes the final scene open ended in such a way as to leave the audience confused and disappointed . we are left wondering whether the " eleven " actually got away with their caper...or worse . what a way to completely overturn the mood of a movie that at least had the merit of being light-hearted . the writer of the screenplay even said as much in the audio commentary to the dvd ! ( as did the actors in their commentary . ) probably the best moment on this dvd is hearing the screenwriter tell soderbergh to his face that he screwed up the ending . i am loath to give either 1 or 5 stars , since hardly anything is absolutely good or bad , but this film comes very close to 1 star . this is your standard artistically worthless hollywood product . it is big on budget , big on bling , and low on story . i suppose if you just feel like wasting some time , this is as good a way to do it as any . personally i would rather have a story with more substance
books neg 547.txt from a sociological perspective , hustlers , beats , and others serves what it set out to do , explore the sociological aspects of billiards in america and the culture that has accompained it through time . however with the recent boom of billiards into mainstram american society , many of his observations and conclusions are dated if not false . te book just goes to many places , crime , pornography , etc. and fails what it set out to originally acomplish . furthermore , i find it quite unusal that the author chooses to contend a great deal of current ideologies toward billiards . is this not a sociological perspective , or an historical editorial.as a college student , and a sociology major , the author fails to win my support from his argument . all in all , quite disapointing as i found it at my local bookstore and the cover looked interesting . i was left with a feeling of disappointment when i finished this book , as it completely crushed many of the idealization and ideologies and norms that are associated to theculture of billiards . stick with the sociology , cut the editoria
camera neg 479.txt normally i wouldnt write a review , but i have had numerous experiences with this camera that i thought i would share . my sister first bought the camera , and i was amazed with how user friendly it was and i thought the pictures turned out pretty well . shortly afterward , her screen blacked out , without any great impact or weather damage . naturally , i assumed it mustve gotten bumped in the wrong way , tough luck . i then proceeded to buy one for myself , and a couple of months after i had it , my screen also inexplicably failed to work . and then for christmas , my sister received a replacement camera for her broken one , and yet again , shortly after purchase , the screen was broken . i do accept some responsibility for the damage , i imagine that if it was in a purse in a bookbag , perhaps it got rattled around a bit . but three times ? i dont find this to be a coincidence , and i do not reccomend that you risk your money , because you too may have to replace it after 3 months
camera pos 597.txt through most of the 1990s , i lived overseas in both europe and asia . unfortunately , my number of photos from these times are limited to a handful as i hated looking like a " tourist " with my bulky camera ! nowadays , i no longer have to worry about that because of cameras like this one ! i intially bought this t7 after using a friend 's t1 and being impressed with the size of it . the t7 is obviously considerably smaller , which is even better ! i bought this camera right as they were coming out and paid well over $400 for it plus a 1gb memory stick pro . both are investments that even to this day ( over a year later ) i am very happy with . i have taken this camera just about everywhere and wherever i go people love to look at it . i can say i 've probably sold at least a dozen of these to people that fell in love with the size of the camera and the quality of photos it takes . as far as size , that is the biggest plus to it 's advantage . it can fit anywhere . even with the optional case that you can buy for it , it still easily fits in a trouser or jacket pocket , without even a noticable bulge . as far as photo quality goes , as most of the reviews note , the camera is very limited when it comes to night time shots . i 've found that these shots are often hit and miss as far as what you 'll get , but for the size of the lens and the size of the flash , what can you expect ? after shooting a few thousand photos with this camera , i know what will be a good and bad night shot , and with the playback feature , you can quickly see the quality of your photo and retake if needed . is it perfect ? no , but that 's super tough in a camera this small . some reviews note the difficulty trying to take a photo while holding the camera still . i 've never had issue with this , but i could see how it could be an issue , it 's just never one either my wife ( the primary user ) or i have dealt with . i would venture that probably the vast majority of buyers of this camera will likewise not have a problem . i 've recorded more than a few .mpg movies with the camera and it surprisingly outperformed some of my bigger ( and more expensive ) point-and-shoot digital cameras . i have been very pleased with that . another drawback noted by many reviews is the lcd screen and the chance of breaking it . i put a plastic screen protector ( the thin plastic sheet type held by static ) on it as soon as i bought it and have n't had a problem . i 've sat on the camera before ( by accident , of course ! ) and have had it in luggage and the like , but have never had a problem . the most significant drawback that i 've had with the camera is that it can take more photos ( esp with the 1gb card ) than the battery will last . buy a second battery and you 'll be more than good , but it 's just something to keep in mind . i would highly recommend this camera for anyone who travels , or anyone who wants a camera to take quick photos . it can be carried anywhere and for the vast majority of shots , it 's all that you need . i can say that we have many photos of our kids ( and really good ones , too ) that we would never had gotten if my wife did n't regularly carry this camera in her purse and diaper bag ! i 'm happy enough with it that i 'm going to buy a second one for myself ( especially now that the prices have dropped so much ! ) so that my wife can use our first one entirely for her own photography . i give it five stars and would definately recommend it to others

music pos 162.txt i have to admit that , at first listening , i found some aspects of ms.belle 's interpretations of these pieces disorienting . however , as i listened to these covers repeatedly , i can now say that i understand better what the vocalist is after . not that i always agree with her and with george duke , the arranger / producer , but i agree with their choices and their totally new project and enjoy having had my horizons broadened . ms.belle has immense talent , superb technique , and a clear idea of each piece , and she delivers the goods without faltering or compromise . i admire that a lot in a performer . her choices ask us for a reaction and we are free to accept or reject what she has offered us . when i first heard these renditions , i was quite stand-offish , but over time i have come to appreciate them more and more - almost to the point of addiction - and am grateful to regina and george for their strength of conviction as well as their superior musicianship.they do not want us to listen in a passive way , they are waiting for our reaction..and god , this is really so , so good....that 's the true spirit in which an album should be recorded . i 'd encourage you to get this album because it is about strong , powerful and personal interpretations of some great jazz standards by regina . you may love everything about it , or you may reject aspects of her interpretations . but in any case you will not remain indifferent ; you will be enriched by hearing these pieces in a clear and beautifully personal way . that is an important aspect of why i love this imaginative , innovative quality music and why this recording is invaluable . and it cannot be said enough that her backing band is incredible , giving this album the necessary push to take it over the edge . it is a success because it skilfully avoids being categorized . regina has had the courage to break out of the traditional mould and make a successful cross-over , which some purists may not approve of.. . only time will tell... .

dvd neg 948.txt with the straight story , lynch demonstrated none of the recognizable trademarks that transformed him into the director that i love . this film felt like a " blind date " gone bad . the straight story showed up , david lynch arrived , but the rest of the date felt muddled , confusing , and utterly disastrous . everything in this film seemed wrong . lynch 's choice for lead actor , the bland sissy spacek , the filler of repeat cornfield montages , all the way to the incoherent time spent on the read , i just felt that nobody had control over this picture , yet the randomness ( and the possible tear ending ) gave critics something to smile about . this is not a david lynch film , and for those walking into this with images of mulholland drive , twin peaks , or even eraserhead in their mind will be utterly discombobulated . the straight story attempted to show us a slice of americana via the cornfields of iowa , but for this boy based in the flatlands of illinois , it just seemed repetitive and boring . what initially pulled me away from this film was the technique that lynch used to introduce us to alvin and his daughter rose . alvin lying on the ground because he ca n't get up , the cliché use of taking him to the doctor letting us know that he is deteriorating , while bringing us the central conflict of his brother falling ill was just too much in such a little time frame . spacek 's depiction of rose seemed unbalanced and rather stale . she brought nothing fresh to this rather emotional character outside of a stutter and some unfunny scenes . i expected so much more from spacek with her timeline of cinema , but this felt like something she did on an afternoon instead of providing us with the intensity that she harbors . then , to add more fuel to the fire , there was richard farnsworth . again , he is n't a horrible actor , but it felt like lynch picked him because he fit the role physically , but alas , could n't master it mentally . farnsworth seemed out in left field for a majority of his time onscreen . i could n't tell if he was trying to remember his lines or if he was truly in character . his eyes seemed watery for everything which brought too much emotion to those little scenes , and seemed to bring not enough by the dramatic ending . his entire speech about his time overseas at war was pathetic , while some will quote it as being his speech of a lifetime , i saw it as babble ( and no , i am not that insensitive - i just felt it could have been handled by a stronger , more professional actor ) . the rest of the cast seemed equally as unimportant . i wanted lynch to either go 100% for this film or none at all , but alas , it felt as if he just half-ed his way through this heap . speaking of david lynch , where did he go in this film ? there were some scenes that i witnessed that screamed the director that i love , but then there were others that just felt like he took pointers from ken burns ' " looking at america " class . i hated the sweeping cornfields that seem to plague this film . instead of keeping us by alvin 's side throughout his journey , lynch gave us a repetitive view of farming and corn . there is nothing wrong with this technique when making the epic that one desperately needs to see once in a while , but when the same images were used over and over again , i nearly felt lynch was humoring us with the dulls of iowa instead of being the majestic all the critics raved about . i think he could have been stronger with his filler than what he was with this film . he needed something to couple with the authenticity of alvin , but the stock-footage that he chose to show was definitely not the balance one could hope for . i also felt there was more to be discussed with the friends that he met along the way . alvin was a walking storybook , filled with the way that he led his own life instead of listening to those around him and learning from their experiences as well . lynch made alvin very closed minded , which did not create a strong protagonist for the feature . alvin was a strong character , but i needed more with this story . i wanted him to make choices , learn new things , and bring that to his brother 's table when they eventually met . i felt cheated when this never occurred and felt as if lynch was saying that this journey through americana was that we could learn from alvin , and not vice-versa . overall , i was n't stunned by this picture . i thought lynch could have been stronger with his choice of direction and cast instead of what seemed like he just " played it safe " . the overplayed stock footage of cornfields infuriated me due to the lack of time that we could have been spending with alvin . speaking of alvin , why could n't he have been a stronger , better-rounded character ? i felt after watching this film that lynch had duped me into believing that he wanted to paint a picture of america , but instead gave us nothing more than soft music , recycled images , and stock characters . the stories were interesting to listen to , but brought nothing fresh to the table . i must admit that the brotherly love moment brought a tear to my eye ( since i have a brother as well ) , but why could n't we focus on this further . lynch made the riff between the two brothers seem like a toss in the pan , when it was the central focus of this film . the straight story could have been a strong tale bringing in a new image for lynch , but instead it felt jagged and old . i could suggest one viewing for this film , any further , and you will see how dull those cornfields really claim to be ! grade : ** out of ****

health neg 324.txt i was overwhelmed by the choices , and selected this model , in part , because of the reasonal price . i had read reviews which mentioned problems and the need to return the product , but i decided there was only a small possibility of that happening . the instructions said to use the lowest setting initially , which certainly made sense . however , the instructions said to move the adjustment " toward the tip " , which turned out to be the highest , not the lowest setting ! the diagram on the handle indicated that the movement was toward the larger opening , but i read the directions and did not look at the diagram until later . the spray was very powerful and actually " hurt " , especially when it was by my tooth with a crown . the next day i tried adjusting the settings with the pik over my sink , not in my mouth ! it felt wonderful on the lower setting ! i reread the directions again ( and again over the next several days ) to see if the error was mine or theirs . i still think the directions were not written properly . the third day i had trouble getting any spray at all . this continued for about a week , some days getting more or less , but never a full spray on any setting ! my guess is that it was in a permanent " pause " mode . i gave up and pursued returning the item . it needed to be returned to an " authorized repair " , which luckily was only a few miles away ( there were only three in my state ) . the repair man had told me , over the phone , it was a discontinued model and had n't been made in about a year . when he looked at it , he found it had been made in 2006. he said he could fix it , but was n't allowed to ; i am awaiting a replacement to arrive in the mail .

camera pos 466.txt i bought my k10d in dec 06 after owning a number of pentax cameras over the years and being very pleased with the engineering . the combination of features , if executed properly , make this camera the best buy in 10mp dslrs right now . i postponed my review because i wanted to get some real field experience . i just went to mexico , and panicked because i left the camera instruction manual behind . i can now report on that trip . i did a little fumbling at first , mainly because i did n't have the manual , but i was soon able to find the combinations i wanted , and the camera performed both flexibly and intuitively . the af button and the exposure compensation button are very well placed . i found myself in difficult lighting situations often , and both af and exposure metering worked quite well . i also took some hand-held shots that i normally would use a tripod with ( such as at 450mm ) , and very few came out fuzzy because of camera movement . in a few cases , i used bracketing , and was easily able to obtain a good balance of details in one or more of the bracketed shots . exposure metering worked so well that i stopped bracketing . i particularly liked the display modes : i could boost the brightness to see the display even in bright daylight , and deep zooming gave me a good check of whether a shot was " soft " or not right at the scene . the rechargeable li ion batteries , although not readily available in stores , seem to last forever ( even using power zoom , and full-bright display , and some fill flash ) . i believe that i could have shot all week ( 700 shots in raw ( dng ) + jpeg ) with the battery grip attached . in summary , this camera was a pleasure to hold , very easy to use and manipulate , and resulted in a high percentage of crisp photos ( even if the percentage of well-composed shots was lower because of the photographer ) . i bought it because of its compatibility with pentax lenses , 10mp sensor , shake-reduction technology , larger display , and especially the dust and water seals . but what makes me quite happy about it is its overall ease of use and good results . i am still discovering its features , but i already know that this camera frees me to be creative in ways that other cameras have not in the past . some of the features on this camera are unique ( new program lines ) and some are available only on cameras costing several hundred dollars more , making the k10d a good choice and a best buy . once again for pentax , the engineering is supurb .

books pos 881.txt black metropolis is perhaps the founding document of african-american studies , a classic work of sociology that still resonates today . it is a paradigmatic expression of the chicago school of sociology , however , a school that today stands in some disrepute , at least in some circles . indirectly , it was the target of james baldwin 's famous attack on richard wright in his essay , everybody 's protest novel . the claim of the criticism has been that the chicago school , due to its insistance upon using a & quot ; scientific approach&quot ; , merely reproduces the very terms under which african-americans have been oppressed- -a claim that has proceeded under the warrant of european intellectuals such as theodor adorno . still , black metropolis is a landmark study , and , unfortunately , many if not most of its observations and conclusions remain true today , and in fact it could be argued that conditions in the black belt of chicago have gotten worse , not better , since 1945 , the year of black metropolis ' publication- -which lends a certain credence to the criticisms mentioned above , though perhaps it should be qualified by saying that they are not so much criticisms of the chicago school as they are criticisms of american society . since then , as we know , we have witnessed a great shift in american public opinion away from what some consider to be the excesses of those days ; so much so , in fact , that the work of black metropolis may again be regarded as a profoundly useful book . embodying american liberalism as it does- -which counted as a grave sin thirty years ago- -black metropolis may possibly be due for a fresh look

books pos 307.txt always lively and perspicacious , this clever book seeks to solve a seemingly trivial puzzle : while historians have mustered a host of plausible explanations ( weapons , diseases , horses , etc. ) for why europeans spread so thickly into north america , australia , new zealand and argentina ( the lands crosby labels " neo-europes " ) , what could possibly explain why the dandelion did so as well ? the question does n't appear so innocuous when it is pointed out that not just the dandelion , but the european housefly , and feral pigs , and a horde of other weeds , pests , crops , diseases and livestock from europe followed suit . quite often these organisms , even the domesticated ones , raced ahead of european explorers themselves , rapidly proliferating into vast herds and stands that the settlers themselves could not fathom . why was this so ? why did n't , say , australian weeds , their seeds inadvertently shipped back to england , eventually carpet the meadows and fields of europe ? to answer this odd question , professor crosby begins his story with pangaea- -the great supercontinent that began to split apart about 200 million years ago into the continents we now have scattered about the globe . these " seams of pangaea " then forced a radical divergence in the terrestrial flora and fauna of the planet , and set the stage for the equally radical convergence initiated when european mariners crossed these now mid-oceanic seams . crosby details case after case in each category : weeds , pests , livestock , diseases and crops . he forcefully illustrates how sudden and overwhelming the ecosystem takeover was until the suspense is too much to bear . what is the answer ? he drops clues every now and then , and the most explicit one is in the form of a quote that begins one of the final chapters : if weeds are to be defined as those organisms that thrive on the disturbances caused by humans , then humans themselves must be considered the primary weed of all . here , then is the answer : all the opportunistic fellow-travelers of the european diaspora are exquisitely coadapted to the scale and pace of the continuous ecological disequilibrium characteristic of the old world civilizations- -and they , in turn , furthered and helped generate that very disequilibrium . together- -humans , horses , cattle , pigs , rats , clover , peaches , measles and , yes , dandelions- -comprised a potent self-replicating system , dimly discerned by its contemporaries , that could not be stopped once it spilled across the seams of pangaea

dvd neg 503.txt even though i am not a streisand fan , i was astonished at just how dopey and annoying this movie was . the plot is supposed to revolve around a big change in appearance for streisand 's character , making her attractive - no , irresistible - to the main male character . the problem is , she looks almost exactly the same before and after the makeover ! somebody ( probably streisand ) thinks that highlighted hair , a tight black cocktail dress , and a baggy-lipped smirk are irresistible whereas a pink bridesmaid dress , casual clothes , and everyday looks are disgusting . baaaaaamp ! ( that 's the fallacy alarm going off : men , in my experience , do n't care much about clothes and makeup . ) there was a lot of emphasis placed on the streisand character 's losing weight by riding an exercise bike , but she looked exactly the same afterward - no detectable weight difference ! yet truly , the low point of the movie is the scene in which streisand , discussing her baby and early-childhood photos with her mother ( played by lauren bacall ) , blubbers , " wazz i a pretty baby ? wazz i a pretty babyyyyeeee ? " in that one scene , streisand 's neuroticism concerning her looks is fully revealed . the whole movie is about this issue , and it 's amazing that an entire cast , crew , and production company would devote themselves to b.s. 's emotional issues like that . i really think that the " funny girl " phenomenon somehow ruined streisand 's thought processes . the media buzz about her at the time was that she was kind of cute despite being light-years away from the stereotyped , northern european beauty standard of the time ( think grace kelly ; think ingrid bergman.... . ) . i recall reading about how her glowing complexion , thick hair , and good figure ( as well as her energy and voice ) carried her through despite her looks : long nose , large lips , slanted eyes . myself , i think she looks like an egyptian princess or similar ; but she certainly does n't look like grace kelly.... . so why ca n't she accept this ? the majority of us women , whatever our race , color , or bone-structure , learn to live with and love who we are.....at least i hope we do ! this movie is not about that . this movie says that you have to have a certain dress and hairdo to be desirable . maybe i should 've given it only one star
music pos 380.txt i would have to say that out of the countless bands i have heard over the past few years into eternity is one of the best and has one solid album here ! ! i think they have something a lot of bands do not have and the one cool thing about them is tim roth seems to give a real crud about his fans as he does guitar videos on his website to show you how you can break down his guitar riffs and that to me as a guitarist is so helpful ( ive learned some of their songs this way ) and this shows how he is not afraid to be the nicest guy and actually take that kind of time to be close and original to his fans.you just never see that these days . and the rest of this band has so much talent , stu can scream like halford growl too and has a high vocal range and it makes them sound interesting . plus jims drum work , how can anyone say this dude isnt one of the better drummers , he is so tight but can slow it down and tempo change very well . this album plain rocks , it should be known as these guys were on gigantour and rocked there too . be cool if them and annihilator went on tour . i have become very fond of them and hope they stick around and keep making great albums in a world overflowing with the same ole un-original bands that all sound the same !

books neg 842.txt the first novel of laurell k . hamilton 's merry gentry series is not , actually , that terrible a book . it 's by far the best in a not particularly great series , actually . what made it almost impossible for me to read is that the basic premise , the set-up , is one of the most grotesquely , ridiculously stupid things i 've ever read . princess meredith nicessus has fled faerie , in fear of death at the hands of her aunt , andais , the queen of air and darkness and ruler of the unseelie court . high profile fae in this world are major public figures , like rock stars or the royal family of england . the sudden disappearance of one of the unseelie royals is a very big deal indeed . every news media in the world reports the story....and it never goes away . we are told solemnly that reports of princess meredith being spotted are right up there with elvis sightings . meredith 's image , the story of her mysterious disappearance , is everywhere . i mean , neolithic pygmies living in deepest africa know who meredith is , and what she looks like . meanwhile , princess meredith has disguised herself as a mortal private eye . thing is , she has n't disguised herself very much at all . her supernaturally pale skin is now humanly pale skin . her fae red hair is now human red hair . her facial features remain the same . and with everyone on the planet wondering where is princess meredith , for years on end , no one recognizes her . let me hasten to add , there is no magic involved in this , they honestly simply do n't recognize her . and the crowning touch to this masterful disguise , the name chosen for her pseudonym to hide the fact she 's actually princess meredith is....wait for it....merry gentry . jesus wept . and for years , none of her co-workers , no one who knows her , says to themself , " hey , wait a minute , that women who looks almost exactly like princess meredith....merry gentry....princess meredith....oh my god , merry gentry is princess meredith ! " nope , she 's just incognito , baby . at which point i almost threw down the book and said , " you have got to be kidding me . " it 's absolutely amazing to me this made it through the editing process . do laurell hamilton 's editors do anything other than rubber stamp her writing ? given her past six or eight novels , including this one , i 'm tempted to say : no , actually

music pos 382.txt back when blondie was being hailed as the biggest new-wave band in pop music by fans and critics alike , there were also just as many critics that quickly dismissed blondie as " bubblegum pop , " and one group that would never have staying power . but i think it 's been observed enough how the group has had the last laugh . parallel lines helped establish blondie as a serious music group and turned their cult following into commercial success . this album is also the first where debbie harry 's voice gets sharpened with the sensibility of a sweet , vulnerable girl one minute to sultry and rapturous behind disco grooves the next . the album made punk , pop , and disco shake hands , which was a method unheard of in 1978. songs like " hanging on the telephone , " " picture this , " " pretty baby , " and " sunday girl , " have become irresitable pop gems , while " i know but i do n't know , " and " fade away & radiate , " featuring a terrific guitar lick by robert fripp , are punk-driven classics . last but not least are the two hits that are forever getting played on the classic rock stations of today in " one way or another , " and " heart of glass . " and how has debbie harry played out as lead singer after all these years ? as rolling stone stated when this album was ranked #140 on their list of the 500 greatest albums of all time , " madonna was surely watching .

camera neg 280.txt the look and feel of this camcorder is very good . unfortunately my camcorder use is limited to low light indoor activities . for example , evening party , indoor school activities , kid drama and orchestra . this camcorder is not at all suitable for these activities . earlier i had a sony dcr trv140 , which was way better than this camcorder . this camcorder has a very small sensor and hence such a low price . one easy guide to evaluate the sensor size is to look at the optical zoom . most of the camcorders with more than 10x optical zoom has small sensors . these large optical zoom camcorders will perform poorly in low light . if you are planning to use this camcorder in low indoor light , i do not recommend it .

camera pos 303.txt first thing to do is to make sure which lens you are buying . the kit lens comes with canon 20d , 30d , 300d , or xt is the lower version , non usm one . on the higher version usm ones , you will see the red color " usm " at the front of the lens . according to the reviews , compare with the non usm ones , optically they are the same . however , the usm motor does focus faster and much quieter . people complain about the build quality . actually i feel that it is really not that bad , much better than the canon 50mm f1.8 ii . the usm auto focus performance is fast , never hunt , and much quieter than the 50mm f1.8 ii . it fits nicely on the xt . do not compare this hundred dollar lens to other lenses cost three times or more . we have to compare apple to apple . if you know the limitations on this lens and use it wisely , the images will come out nicely . 1. this is not the lens for indoors low light conditions . if you need to take lots of indoor pictures and the flash is not allowed , go get a different lens . ( for example , i use a canon 50mm f1.4 for this kind of situation . ) 2. the distortion on 18mm is quite a bit . avoid taking strait lines ( like buildings ) pictures on the edge while wide open . however , this can be easily corrected on computers . 3. step down the aperture to f8 or f11 , the resolution will be improved a lot even at the corners . overall , the performance is very good for a hundred dollar lens . it is very light weight and highly portable while traveling . this fits my needs as a cheap but fast with good image quality walk around lens .

books neg 747.txt when i first picked up drinking coffee elsewhere , i was excited to have the chance to read something that so many people seemed to enjoy . and , truthfully , it 's not a horrible book . it is entertaining , the style works , etc. on that note , if you 're looking for a fun read and do n't plan on thinking about it too much , then by all means , get it . my problem with the book is that it does n't deserve all the acclaim it 's getting- - if you want something that breaks boundaries or adds a new voice to the current socio-political situation of america , this is not your book . probably one of the major problems with the collection is that it 's heralded as a riveting commentary on the plight of the african american female . packer has very little new to say , and most of the underlying themes of the stories have not only been said previously by alice walker and other writers , but have also have been said better by those authors . drinking coffee elsewhere is no more than a watered down version of you ca n't keep a good woman down , a book that , while having its own problems , would probably be a better use of your time and money if you 're really interested in the social commentary in the text . even from the literary standpoint , it 's not terribly outstanding . the characters are stereotypes ; the plots are predictable . the adult female protagonists are all essentially the same person- - an intelligent outsider who struggles with race , religion , and fitting in- - and are generally pretty ornery about it as they do so . the other protagonists are the same , just not so irritable . similar to this lack of variation in her characters , packer varies little in her narrative style . yes , the language is pretty at times , but there is no experimentation with language or structure ; all of the writing is in a highly generic voice . finally , the stories themselves contain scenes that are n't necessary and that detract from the actual narrative . in short , drinking coffee elsewhere proves that what it takes to sell a lot of books is n't actual talent , but how much your publisher backs you . packer had the good fortune to have famous mentors and to be the product of some highly acclaimed writing programs , which resulted in her being picked up by a big name publisher who could pay to get her name out

software pos 929.txt rosetta stone spanish is the third major spanish course that i am buying . i have comtpleted all of the spanish lessons in the pimsleur series , and have also completed learning spanish like crazy level one and two . i am one of those rare latinas that did not learn spanish from my parents . my mexican parents felt that it would be easier to " assimilate " if i only spoke english . after going to my grandparents ' home for holidays and being the only one there that did not speak spanish , and after having latino strangers speak to me in spanish and then look at me in astonishment when i struggled just to say " no , hablo espanol , " i felt that it was time for me to learn how to speak my language . the first course that i used was pimsleur spanish . compared to rosetta stone i must say that i learned much more vocabulary with the rosetta stone software . but i recommend pimsleur over rosetta stone , especially for the complete beginner . because of its easy teaching method , in my opinion pimsleur is even better than lslc for someone that has no experience whatsoever speaking spanish . pimsluer goes at a very slow pace . but if you have already learned some spanish on your own or in high school or college , then you can probably skip pismleur and go straight to lslc . or if you are the type of person that believes learning a foreign language should be more like a hurdle than a marathon you 'll probably want to go with learning spanish like crazy . lslc covers a lot more spanish words and grammar than pimsleur and moves at a quicker pace . so where does rosetta stone fit in ? i would say use rosetta stone after you have completed the above courses . it is difficult to really learn how to speak spanish with this software alone because you are only looking at pictures and repeating the phrases that you hear . you never really learn how to think in spanish and create your own sentences . so why am i still giving it 4 stars ? because if you already know how to speak some spanish from another course and you are on an intermediate level then you can add plenty more spanish words to your vocabulary by using the rosetta stone software . one negative about this course is that the method is tedious because the software 's interface is " antiquated " with photos from the 1980s . and the sound quality is not as clear as pimsleur or learning spanish like crazy . but if you stick it out through the drudgery , you will be surprised with how many spanish words you learned with this software . but i think pimsleur did a better job of teaching me concepts than this software is doing . and by teaching me concepts , i have really retained the material and by understanding concepts , i am able to take my own thoughts and form sentences . something that i would not have been able to do if i had used this course alone . another negative about this course , is that unlike the other two courses that i mentioned , you have to use rosetta stone while sitting in a computer . that is difficult for me because i am very busy with classes , work and my personal life . i can use pimsleur or lslc on my mp3 player and not have to worry about sitting at a computer . besides the limited vocabulary and the slow teaching method , the only downside of pimsleur is that it does not teach the same spanish words that are most commonly used by mexicans and other latinos in regular conversation . pimsleur spanish is very formal spanish . we say " mucho gusto " like lslc teaches , pimsleur teaches " encantado . " and in our overly " macho " culture if a man responds with " encantado " many latinos may get the wrong impression about him . it is not something that i am proud to say about my ( latino ) culture , but it is true . and pimsleur does not warn the male student that if you say " encantado " to some latinos they may get the wrong impression about the speaker . learning spanish like crazy has taught me useful practical spanish that i can use to communicate with my spanish speaking friends and family . when i tell people that i learned to speak spanish as an adult and not at home as a child , many of them do not believe me . i think they find it incredible for two reasons : one , my accent really sounds like a native speaker from using lslc . two , i have learned real conversational spanish from lslc . i have learned words and phrases that spanish speakers actually use when speaking to each other . pimsleur taught me spanish that the author of the course thought that i should speak , not the spanish that latinos really speak . that is one of the positive things that separates lslc course from the others . so in what order would i rate the three in terms of ease of teaching method : 1. pimsleur spanish 2. learning spanish like crazy 3. rosetta stone spanish but in terms of teaching real conversational spanish and teaching a real latin american accent , i rate them as follows : 1. learning spanish like crazy 2. pimsleur spanish 3. rosetta stone spanish

camera neg 908.txt i bought this frame to display pictures of my newborn daughter on my desk at work . i did n't really have high expectations for it , because it was so inexpensive . as soon as it was turned on i had the following problems : 1 ) five seconds after i turn it on , it always says " usb connected ! " - - and i do n't have a usb cable inserted into it ! this also freezes the device . i found a way around this by selecting the memory card to read from within this initial 5 seconds or turning the frame on without any memory cards inserted . 2 ) i cannot copy files over to it as described in pages 33-35 of the manual . my computer does recognize the usb device , but when i try to copy files over to the frame , i get a " path is not found " error . 3 ) i thought i could live with the above 2 problems if it could just show my pictures . so i used a card reader to load .jpg files onto a cf card at 400x300 resolution . when , i plugged the card into the frame , these files show up as " invalid " when i try to view them . emailed coby with the 3 bullet points above , got a response 30 hours later saying : " coby tech support to me 5:25 am ( 3 hours ago ) hello , we have received your inquiry . it appears that your unit is defective . return the unit to the retailer for an exchange .

dvd neg 465.txt i saw this movie and i found it both shocking and choking . it displays children as young as 4 years old smoking cigarettes ! did the filmmakers take into account the damage tobacco could have done to these child stars ? ( yes , the cigarettes and the smoke were real , not cg . ) i think they should have omitted such scenes from the script , because it displays a behavior that 's not only illegal in several countries , but also threatening to both society and childhood . no matter what the other reviewers thought about the movie , i give it a disgusting 1 , and this is the last movie i ever watch that depicts smoking children . to those that have n't yet watched this movie , please do n't watch it , unless you want cancer to win the health wars . and here i hand out a lesson for every active or aspiring moviemaker : if you want to depict smoking children , use computer graphics instead of the real thing

software neg 29.txt i have to qualify this review by saying that i do not own pm 8.0 , so i cannot fairly give a rating , despite overwhelmingly negative reviews . i can only relate personal experience with norton / symantec products . i do own and have used pm 6.0 since ' 01 when it was still powerquest instead of norton / symantec and it has worked very well , though the gui is a bit quirky . i have run it with 2 drives , one with 98se and xp pro , with pm loaded on 98se partition and it did everything i needed on both drives . trouble is , version 5.0 is , afaik , not compatible with xp and since m$ no longer supports 98se , we have a problem , houston . currently i am using a mobile drive bay to switch drives as needed . if i get a drive partitioning software product compatible with xp , it most assuredly will not be anything produced by norton / symantec , based on these reviews and personal experience with norton / symantec products . i first bought a computer in ' 98 and used norton antivirus 5.0. at that time , norton was probably the best antivirus product out there . it worked flawlessly and i used and recommended it for years . no more . i purchased a copy of symantec system works 2005 right after it was released . long story short , i no longer use norton products because i got tired of the system crashes and stability issues caused by the unstable bloatware and system resource hog that it has become , and am currently using a competing product that is very highly rated but is not common on the shelves of the big box stores . there is one lone symantec product i still use- --windoctor , which is not installed on my ' puter but ran from the cd as needed . adios , anything else produced by norton / symantec . it ai n't worth the headaches when there are much better products available for less coin .

dvd pos 277.txt i guess i understand why this movie was so savagely criticized during it 's year of release , 1986. prince was still enjoying huge popularity based largely on the success of " purple rain , " both the film and the soundtrack . and critics love to knock someone off a pedestal , which is what they did to prince in those days . many claimed that the movie was nothing more than an ego trip . they could n't believe prince had the nerve to fire the director and then assume that role himself . it was all way too harsh criticism for a movie that is n't trying to be anything more than a fun romantic comedy . of course , poor critical response alone does n't usually keep the public from making a movie popular . yet " under the cherry moon " was a bomb at he box office . probably the main reason for this is that the movie , although shot in color , was released in black-and-white . for some unfathomable reason , the general movie-going public is more often than not horrified at the prospect of seeing a black-and-white movie . now do n't get me wrong , i 'm not claiming that had the movie been released in color that people would have flocked to it in droves . i 'm only saying that it would have attracted more of an audience if it had been in color . i will acknowledge that this movie 's target audience is prince fans . since i am one myself , and have been most of my life , i 'm not the most entirely objective viewer . but i make no apologies for my love of this movie . it 's not a " guilty pleasure " for me , because i proudly hold this as one of my favorites . i had only seen it a couple times before the dvd release - and unfotunately i missed it in theaters ( i could n't get anyone to take me , i was only 12 and none of my friends were into p and certainly not my parents - though my dad went with me a few years later to see " grafitti bridge " on opening night , but that 's for another review ) . but since it 's dvd release in 2004 , this has become one of my most-watched discs in my collection . the soundtrack is killer , the tunes make up one of the best prince albums ever . there 's even some great stuff heard in the movie that did n't make the album ( some of which was issued on 12 " vinyl ) . plus , i think the movie looks great - the cinematographer was michael ballhaus , who has multiple academy award nominations to his credit ( and was the dp on numerous martin scorsese classics ) . i wonder how the movie would feel in color , but i do think black-and-white was the right way to go . even though the movie is set in then-contemporary times , it has the feel of something from the ' 30s . there are so many classic moments in this movie , i wo n't try to list them all . but here are a few.. . christopher tracy ( prince ) giving his " bela lugosi eyes " ...tricky ( jerome benton ) tossing rose petals into the tub while christopher takes a bath...christopher freaking out when he sees bats at the eatery...the " wreka stow " scene...the car race between christopher and mary sharon ( kristen scott thomas ) . as for the acting , i 've heard a lot of people saying that prince 's performance was no good . i do n't see much truth in that claim . after being so serious in " purple rain , " it was a nice contrast to see him so loose and funny in this . jerome benton proved he could do just fine even without morris day at his side ( as in " purple rain " ) - i 'm surprised jerome has n't done much additional acting outside of prince movies . and obviously kristen scott thomas moved on from this , her first major role , to become an oscar-nominated , highly repected leading lady . how is the dvd presentation ? pretty good , for such a largely overlooked movie . the widescreen transfer and 2.0 stereo mix are n't anything phenomenal , but get the job done nonetheless ; the movie looks and sounds fine . as for features , anyone expecting a full-blown special edition like the 2-disc " purple rain " will be disappointed . but at least it 's not a completely bare-bones release - four music videos are included , though unfortunately not presented in optimal audio / visual quality ( though they are passable , i would 've preferred 5.1 mixes ) . the highlight is the live performance of " anotherlover " which was taken from a never-released ( at least not domestically , not sure if it saw the light of day anywhere outside the u.s. ) concert video documenting the parade tour . mtv held an interesting ( i.e. - very weird ) contest to determine where " under the cherry moon " would have it 's world premiere . the ten-thousandth caller to an mtv hotline would accompany prince to the premiere , which would be held in their hometown . mtv ran a special that covered the premiere party - and unlike the premiere of " purple rain " unfortunately this program is not to be found on " under the cherry moon " ' s dvd release . lisa barber was the contest winner , and the movie did indeed premiere in her hometown of sheridan , wyoming - a very unusual place for a big movie to premiere . when asked what he thought of the town of sheridan , prince summed it up with a single word : " purple . "

music pos 993.txt this film came out in 1973 and i saw it in its original full length version ( about 3hours and 15 min . ) executives from columbia pictures were there , it was the premeire , and they were groaning and at the intermission fights broke out ( verbal ) and ushers passed among them and myself and everyone else with soundtrack albums . the executives left the theatre and scaled the albums across columbus circle in boston and i and a few friends retrieved them and had quite a few for free . we returned to the film and i have always loved this crazy redition of lost horizon , the miscasting , the terrible sets , the odd ball music for the story , the dubbed liv ullmann , the dance routines of olivia hussey..all of it . you cannot find a musical like it , or a soundtrack like it . columbia execs were unimaginative ; they should have believed in this film . the next day after this premeire in boston , new york etc. ( simultaneous i suppose ) the film was cut , the posters were taken down..there was a ton of material to buy..t shirts , dolls , posters of all sizes , bath towels with the poster on them , records of the sd tk of course , and small pop up sets of the entire film . it was to be a massive hit..in two days time all of the paraphanalia was removed , and the posters said , last two weeks , and in two weeks the whole thing disappeared . but many people came to see it..lines of people , and , when they heard it had been cut , they gave up , and in two weeks everyone said farewell to this film . i have many treasures from that opening nite , and now i have the cd of the sound track . anyone who loves movie magic or madness has to see and hear this film ; it is unique . enjoy this soundtrack and get your hands on a dvd ..they are out there

( as in it was n't , yet another , atg clone ) they seem to have more melody than thrash but definitely embody aspects of both genres... . the haunted , where the former atg guitar players are now located , seemed have gone with more thrash then melody . ( which is odd since they actually have atg 's guitar players ? ) anyway , enough comparisons ! nightrage is really decent for a newer band in an over saturated scene.. . amazing guitar work and one of the genres best vocalist makes this cd well worth a couple of listens . also i 've only given this album 2 spins at the current time and stuff like this usually grows on repeated listens . favorite songs : being nothing , phantasma , omen , and descent into chaos . -4 stars if you liked , agreed , or appreciated this please click yes for : " was this review helpful ?

dvd neg 102.txt while some critics can argue with dan brown 's research and reasoning on certain historical points , one thing these da vinci " debunking " presentations will never be able to refute is this : the downplaying of the feminine role in western civilization and christianity , primarily by the catholic church , and the fact that the church still considered mary magdalene a common prostitute until just a few short years ago : 1969. nor is it possible to refute the recent polymorphously perverse scandals that have rocked the church after centuries of suppression and may have everything to do with the doctrinal distortions that dan brown has brought out in the open for serious review . this institution is in trouble because it is seriously out of balance with itself and has cut off its spiritual nose to despite its face by downplaying or denigrating the role of women as sacred beings and bearers of the light , when their healthy presence is needed more than ever as a corrective to some of these abuses and scandals . dan brown has done the world a great service by showing how the feminine role in the divine was written out 2000 years ago , with help from peter whose misogynistic views of women are plainly evident in the scriptures even today and are still , quite frankly , shocking and debasing . sorry , but upon this " rock " of male dominancy was built the church . thank you again , dan brown , by bringing these matters into the light of day so people can know more of their authentic history or at least do their own research to make up their own minds about which spiritual path is best for them and which ones were built on two millenniums worth of manipulations , obscurations and lies . these obscurations and lies happened through the efforts of a group of petty , insecure and misguided men down through the centuries to ensure their dominance and control over the masses , and they found a way to dominate not only the minds of the masses but their vast material resources , worth trillions , through guilt , control and other hidden but consistent abuses of power . and those of orthodox faith who continue to blindly support such hypocritical institutions have a lot more to answer for than any twenty dan browns put together . people are angry and they are angry at the failure of religion to live up to its own standards of behavior and for distorting what may have been jesus ' actual relationship with the women in his life- -or were the disciples just supposed to be members of a exclusive men 's club with jesus as head and women as a species relegated to second class citizenship ? to answer these questions , some of you will finally have to turn to your own heart and mind for a change instead of some literal interpretation of the truth , because not everything of the light is found in scriptures or on the printed page , especially after the scriptures have been selectively riddled with scissors for reasons of self-interest or from spiritual corruption . the next thing people should ask for is to have the vaults of the vatican thrown open for public view . lord only knows what plunder they contain

software pos 805.txt for years i used powerquest 's drive image 7 for backups . it 's rock solid and totally dependable . when symantec aquired powerquest they rolled the underlying technology of drive image 7 into norton ghost . the result is a very capable and reliable package that can backup partitions or entire drives and also provides support for incremental backups . most importantly , like drive image 7 , it provides for emergency recovery of your system . just boot from the ghost cd and restore the backup ( restore point ) that you select . i 've tested this process by making both full system backups and subsequent incremental backups , and then restoring the system from those backups . the process works flawlessly . if you need to restore to a different physical drive ( replaced a failed drive , etc ) , the process requires a few extra selections , but is still very straightforward . just take the time to read the manual . i 've seen acronis true image recommended by some both here and elsewhere . i 've tried acronis and find it lacking in one major respect : it simply is not reliable . during trials , i made backups with acronis . acronis indicated that the backups were successful but , when attempting to make a system recovery just minutes later , acronis indicated that the backups were corrupted and could not be used . the backups were worthless . when purchasing backup software remember that bells and whistles do n't count for anything . the only thing that counts is reliability . it must be able to reliably restore your system . norton ghost passes that test with flying colors .

dvd pos 329.txt terms of endearment captivates me with the believable relationship of mother and daughter as brilliantly portrayed by shirley maclaine and debra winger . it covers approximately 30 years of the turbulent yet loving relationship between mom aurora and daughter emma . they have their differences ; yet the love between them is always so obvious . it 's also refreshing how they seem to be able to talk about anything with each other , even their sex lives . i 've seen this movie several times , and everytime i cry at the end . in spite of the death , the movie ends on a positive note , giving us the feeling that life is going on and everything is going to be okay . the budding relationship between aurora and her neighbor ( also brilliantly portrayed by jack nicholson ) creates a plot-within-a-plot that is very entertaining and provides some comic relief from the sadness of the relationship between emma and her husband and children . the most interesting aspect is that emma gets so bent out of shape when she finds out that her husband has been cheating on her , when she has been cheating on him as well . somehow though we sympathize with emma and her gentle lover ( played by the very talented john lithgow ) . we feel like they belong together and somehow their relationship does n't seem wrong . if you are in the mood for a movie that is entertaining and gut-wrenching at the same time , this is a perfect choice

books neg 43.txt i bought this audio cd set at the borders store , without the opportunity to preview the narration . had i been able to do so , i probably never would have purchased it , let alone paid full bookstore price for it . but i needed an audiobook for my long drive the next day , so i relented . lesson learned . the audio quality is very insonsistent , at at times very poor , having been transcribed from the original audiotape recording . while the author is obviously greatly informed on the historical and geopolitical details of the middle east , it does read very much like a history text . with the amount of detail presented , and the wide scope of coverage from one end of europe reaching into the former soviet states and beyond , one immediately feels the need for visual aids ( maps , timelines , etc. ) as guidance . the reader 's narration is monotononous , with a very constant cadence which dulls the senses . each sentence sounds the same as the last . this has the unfortunate effect of rendering each piece of information presented as no more significant than any other , and so all of the events seem to be lost to obscurity . after a while , the narration becomes little more than background noise . no information is retained by the listener

books neg 712.txt i actually know where trieste was before i read this book . unfortunately i have never visited the city . i wanted to read this travel book about this famous city , but after a few chapters , i wondered where the book was going to . after the final chapter , i still do not know what the author 's intentions was with this book . perhaps i do n't read too many travel books . obviously the city means a lot to the author , but she did not express it clearly in her writing . i was scratching my head at the end , and wondering what i read . i learned a little about the city , but not in relation to the amount of time i spent reading this short book . the city of james joyce and maximillian . the imperial port of the austo-hungarian empire . the meeting point of slav , german , and latin empires . one of the ending points of the iron curtain . this city breeds interest and yet the author took us on a round about journal that confuses the reader . i am sure the author 's other books are good , her last one was not the greatest .

health pos 927.txt back in the early 90s i was going through a bad acne period . i finally visited a dermatologist , and he put me on an accutane regimen . i had sensitive skin and a tough beard , so regular shaving cream was too harsh ( especially while taking accutane - the solid brush-on cream i was using at the time burned the edges of my lips ) . he recommended that i shave with cetaphil . years later , my skin and beard are still troublesome . therefore , i 've kept cetaphil as a part of my shaving regimen . cetaphil goes on well and provides a nice lubrication for my shaver . it 's not harsh or irritating , even on a freshly shaved face . however , it 's kind of cold in the morning , which is a bit counter-productive after heating my face with hot water and shower steam to soften the whiskers . so i put the bottle on the tub floor while showering to heat it up with the runoff . by the time i 'm done , it 's warm enough for application after rubbing some around my hands for a second or two . however , even though cetaphil feels good and lubricates well , its consistency is a bit thin to use alone . i like a good lather , so i combine cetaphil with kiss my face moisture shave , which was recommended to me by a woman working at gnc . they mix well together , and i get a good , non-irritating shave by using the gillette fusion power razor . for post-shave comfort and to prevent breakouts , i apply a product that contains salicylic acid , such as clean&clear dual-action oil-free moisturizing lotion . if you have a razor-challenging beard and skin combination like me , then make cetaphil part of your shaving routine . recommended
music neg 253.txt i first became a fan of the gorillaz with their excellent 2nd cd , demon days . the interesting thing about this band is that their music is so strange and so " out there " that when you first hear one of their cd's ...it sounds like complete garbage . but once you listen again and again , you start to like it more and more . eventually you end up really liking the cd . that was the case with demon days . after enjoying that cd fully , i thought i should check out the first gorillaz cd , and i did n't like it all that much . there just seems to be very little actual songs on the cd . way too much of it sounds like complete filler . there were a couple throwaway songs on demon days , but most of the stuff on that cd was great . here , we 've got songs that are just...boring . nothing happens . i was waiting for the melody or a cool tune to occur in some of these songs , but it never happens . you just listen to 2-d whining into the microphone with dull beats in the background . ( such as on songs like new genious , man research , and starshine . ) some songs are nothing but beats with no lyrics at all , sometimes sounding just like static noise . songs like this , such as double bass , are cool for a minute or two , but the song drags on for practically 5 minutes . it gets boring . other songs , like 5 / 4 , m1 a1 , and rock the house are catchy at first , but just do n't have staying power . they get old . 5 / 4 got annoying quickly , m1 a1 and punk lost their appeal quickly , and rock the house is another song that would have been better if they cut about 2 minutes out of it . and songs like latin simone are just annoying . the remixes of 19-2000 and clint eastwood that end the cd are also fairly forgettable , although 19-2000 's kind of catchy on the first couple listens . there are some good songs here , though . tomorrow comes today , clint eastwood , gravity , 19-2000 , and left hand suzuki method are cool songs . slow country 's kind of cool , too . and dracula 's got an awesome , almost haunting sound to it , and it 's really absorbing . although it too , unfortuantely , loses its tune and turns to repetitive and aimless techno noise about half way through it . this small collection of good songs , though , is surrounded by a huge collection of filler tracks . much of this cd just is n't really that good . i do n't know...this cd just seemed empty . very few meaningful tracks , lots of filler , and some really annoying and repetitive songs . some good songs were stretched to almost 5-minutes long , mostly given filler techno beats that ruin the songs . clocking in at 72 minutes , ( which makes it 22 minutes ( ! ) longer than demon days ) this cd was loaded with filler and just not enough good stuff . people interested in the gorillaz should pick up their superior follow-up , demon days , instead of this one . if i listened to this debut cd first , i probably would n't have ended up liking this band very much . the good news about this is that the gorillaz have not hit a sophmore slump ; their cds are getting better , not worse . that is a great sign for the future of this awesome band .

camera neg 782.txt this is not the best way to get started in astronomy . the low power eyepiece is fairly useful , the higher power one less so , and do n't even think of using the barlow . the maximum useful magnification for a 60mm scope is about 120-140x , assuming the objective lens is of good quality . when you use the middle and high magnifications provided with this scope , you exceed that limit and the increased image size is more than offset by breakdown . to their credit , the manufacturer has provided a reflex " red dot " finder in place of the useless 5x24 finders that plague so many similar scopes . even so , what you can expect to see in this scope is rather limited . some star clusters will be dimly visible , but galaxies and nebulae will be barely- -if at all- -visible . in a way , it is hard to fault celestron for making and marketing this scope . their upper-tier instruments are quite good , but the big money appears to be made on mass market toys like this . in one sense the sale of these scopes subsidizes their good models . just make sure , gentle reader , to stay away from the toys . using an astronomical telescope is not like playing an mp3 file and but rather like playing a guitar . it is a learned skill . and you must do a lot of homework before you buy a telescope . buying without prior experience is like buying a car without knowing anything about driving . if you want to see the wonders of the sky , contact your local astronomy club and attend one of their star parties . the members love sharing their hobby and can set you straight as to how to get started . the best way is to learn the sky with the unaided eye and 10x50 binoculars ( decent ones are available on amazon ) , then graduate to something along the lines of a 150-200mm ( 6-8 " ) dobsonian ; celestron 's own 6 " starhopper can be found on amazon for under $290. for more information on buying telescopes , see my encyclopedic guide on amazon : " so you want to buy a telescope .

software pos 558.txt i just upgraded sd v4 to sd5 and could not be happier . release 5 has had a very rocky start to say the least . i do believe they released it a bit early . fortunately i read the sd forums daily and only downloaded version 5 when it seemed the big bugs had been dealt with . i have always found this product to be the best in it 's class . best detection and moreover removal . easy to use . i 've also had the product that is typically rated number 1 and for me it is no contest which i will stick with . this is my main , real time anti spyware product . i think one big plus is their customer service availability . this is important . they are very responsive . their forums on their website are also extremely helpful . customer service is also free . this application is fast and is not a resource hog . i have a lot of confidence in it . also recently just downloaded their pc tools plus firewall...it 's another great product and it is free ! basically a good company to deal with . i believe when the dust settles from this new ( albeit too early ) release of version 5 , you will see spyware doctor attain 1st place on many tech lists

camera neg 29.txt this camera worked very well until the lens got jammed in its extended position . i sent the camera for warranty service ( i had it less than 7 months ) , and they refused to honor the warranty because it was a bit scuffed and a little decorative ring on the end of the lens that had been attached with 2-sided tape had come off . they claimed this happened due to physical damage , but this occurred during normal use : i was just changing modes and the lens did n't retract . do n't bother trying to get warranty service unless the unit looks brand new . even then , do n't be surprised if they renege on the warranty . i had another a410 that did the very same thing ( lens got jammed ) , but was stolen in a break-in before i sent it out for service ( so i suppose it was no loss after all ) . obviously there is a design flaw that causes the lens to extend too far and come off track inside . in short , this camera is not suitable for frequent use in the field . if you buy it , and plan to use it a lot , expect to be buying another camera or paying for a repair that should be covered under warranty ( which i 'm not doing ) soon .

dvd pos 864.txt it is almost ashame that north amercian culture needs bill maher . after all , should n't honest yet entertaining social commentary be a little bit more available then it currently is ? on victory begins at home , maher creates entertainment by basically speaking his mind . maher 's central premise that the war on terrorism can be aided by what people do in the united states really is almost a common sense arguement . yet maher is so uniquely unapologetic about what he says and how he presents it , the commentary and comedy bristle with an energy that few comedians can match . maher does this by not pretending he is n't politically opinated , in fact that is what bases his comedy completely on , the rarity of straight-forward unabashed opinion . on victory begins at home he is more democrat then republican , but he openly sides with neither . instead , he rails at all presenting himself as a full person , neither liberal nor conservative , right-wing or left-wing . the end result is an engaging and unique look at culture that seems unfiltered . there is no spin here , what maher realizes is that no spin is funny in a world full of it . with all the spin that is normally doled out by the news media , political columnists and special interest groups , know wonder we need him so much .
dvd neg 138.txt if you have read harmon 's acting resume online , then you know she has talent , she has the training , and the ability to really play a good dramatic role if one came along . but being a mild conservative ( angie is a republican ) in liberal hollywood can useually mean that the film companies give her really medicore scripts to look at . good advice was bad advice for her . it is miscast with two annoying stars ; sheen and richards...and some of the worst scenes and dialoge ever in a movie . it has no redeaming values at all and angie deserves better roles then this . this movie was made by artiscan films , which recently went into bankruptcy and is now lions gate films , their films are still bad no matter the name change , and i still wait to see a better movie come to angie harmon

camera pos 605.txt at first it was a little hard to get my pictures to look as good as the samples , but i found that by re-sizing them to about an inch or so on the computer before downloading them that they show up alot better . also , the ones with higher contrast are easier to see farther away . just look at the samples that come pre-loaded to remind yourself that it is possible to get great-looking pics at a surprisingly high resolution . after a few practice downloads i was thrilled with the results . **another plus : this one came with a wall charger . most have to be plugged in to the usb to charge . the wall charger makes it perfect to share on vacation when you 're away from your computer

dvd pos 121.txt we all know the movie and story of the silence of the lambs . i reviewed the movie and gave it a 5 star rating because to me , it is one of the best films ever made . now , with red dragon , i give it 4 stars but i think this is a very good movie and what makes it so good is... . anthony hopkins , the brilliant actor who plays hannibal lecter . i do n't think this movie would have been as good if hopkins would n't have played the role of lecter . i own the original manhunter , which is an older movie and it was good but hopkins can not be beat for the hannibal lecter role . this is a great thriller film ! ! edward norton delivers a very good performance as retired fbi agent will graham . when a series of serial killing style murders start , graham is called out of retirement to help the fbi catch the killer known as " the tooth fairy " . he eventually seeks the aid of lecter to help him find who this killer is . like silence of the lambs , we find graham visiting lecter in his maximum security facility . very cool scenes in this movie with some blood and violence . this movie holds true to the book with the same name . we get to see lecter wearing the famous face mask he wore in s.o.t.l. without going further into all the details of the movie , i 'll just say this is a great prequel although it came after s.o.t.l. and the movie hannibal . also , ralph fiennes delivers a good performance as the red dragon . for anyone who has n't seen this movie , it 's a must see ! ! ! !
books neg 230.txt children love to follow instructions , step by step , and this book has an over abundance of unnecessary and inefficient steps that can make a simple recipe that would normally take 20 minutes to prep , drag on for hours . any adult , who cooks like this does n't cook often , cooks professionally or spends most of their waking hours in a kitchen . for example , who in a modern home kitchen cuts a stick of butter , melts it in a pan then pours it into a ( plastic , microwave safe ) mixing bowl ? great , now there 's a pan , a knife and a cutting board to wash ! it is a children 's cookbook , so why not cut down on time spent with knives , stovetop flames and inevitable messes by just melting the uncut butter in the plastic mixing bowl with the microwave ? nice pictures , large font , recipes are great , but ( in my opinion ) obviously written by someone working in a fully staffed professional kitchen , not a home .

books pos 251.txt jonathan glover 's book is not quite like anything you 've read on war , state terror , and genocide . the tour of twentieth-century horrors is thematic rather than chronological , organized according to the ethical issues glover wants to explore . this takes a little getting used to , but it allows the author to jump , for example , from the first world war to the cuban missile crisis , to see which lessons had been learned in the interim and which might be applied in the future . the cumulative power of glover 's pointillist technique is enormous . & quot ; humanity&quot ; combines a clear-eyed ( necessarily often gruesome ) depiction of *in*humanity with an informed and enlightening discussion of how leaders and ordinary people can change things for the better . as an examination of the psychological and existential origins of mass murder and genocide , it marks an advance on ervin staub 's classic & quot ; roots of evil , & quot ; and should be of interest to any student of modern history and politics

health pos 50.txt i 'm cursed with sensitive skin and a tough beard . i 'll break out or rash up if my skin gets irritated , so i have to carefully prep for shaving . after years of trial and error , i 've finally settled on a good shaving cream system : cetaphil skin cleanser for a base , then kiss my face moisture shave as a supplement . for post-shave comfort and to prevent breakouts , i use a product like clean&clear dual-action oil-free moisturizing lotion . however , the weak link up until now has been the actual shaver . with the gillette fusion power , i 've finally found the right one . i 've used gillette since they gave my unit free razors during the first gulf war ( i was in the marines at the time ) . they 've gotten the job done , but a 3-blade system is ultimately inadequate for my beard and skin type . it does n't take long for the blades to start cutting my face and neck , especially since i take forever to change blades . i dreaded looking in a bathroom mirror at work and seeing dried blood spots ( not to mention getting blood stains on my collar ) . electric shavers do n't work for me either - too hard on my skin , and i 'd have a five-o'clock shadow around 2pm . so , when i saw gillette touting their new 5-blade system , i gave it a shot . i was initially skeptical about the powered aspect due to my issues with electric shavers . but the fusion power is the happy exception . at first i struggled a bit getting the battery cap off of the end . but once i mastered that maneuver and got the battery in , i was set . it takes one aaa-battery that seems to last a decent interval ( the low-battery indicator is a nice touch ) . and even if the fusion power runs out of juice , you can still shave with it . the shaver glides over my face , and the vibration feels good - kind of like a pick-me-up in the morning . the five blades really nail my beard , and even tough spots like my chin and jaw line remain cut-free . i also like the one-blade trimmer on top - very handy for evening out my sideburns and zapping those stray whiskers right under my nostrils . my only issue is the expense of the blades . but i can make them last a lot longer than the old 3-blade razors while still getting a great shave . and most importantly , i rarely get those annoying cuts anymore ( if i do , it 's more because of rushing or clumsiness than anything else ) . ultimately , the result is worth the higher price . the gillette fusion power is the best shaver i 've ever tried . highly recommended
dvd pos 454.txt overall , this is an extremely awesome concert . i am a big fan of dt , and like pretty much all their stuff . the performance itself is pretty good , although the only truly special thing they do is the instrumedley and jordan 's keyboard solo . other than that they pretty much just play their songs as you hear them on the album . if they had done more special things , it would have gotten a 5 star rating instead of 4. other people complain about how the band really doesnt get into their music during the performance , but would say they did okay as far as that goes . sure the singer doesnt get out from behind the mic stand , thats because half the time he is dragging it along with him , although i will say the band overall doesnt really get into it as much as most other metal bands , and thats probably why they have the video show up on the screens behind them . the special features are also pretty good , but i would not buy this concert just for those , backstage footage and things of that nature are cool but do not make a dvd good by themselves . overall , i did think it was pretty cool , and i would recommend buying it if you like dream theater or just their genre of music in general

books pos 448.txt this is a nice compact hardback edition of dashiell hammett 's five novels , which he wrote between 1929 and 1934. a veteran of pinkerton detective agency in several cities , hammett turned his intimate familiarity with crooks , low-lives , and the seedier side of life into hard-boiled , hard-hitting detective stories . this was a time when urban corruption was the rule , and private detectives , journalists , and police officers shared information . two of these novels , & quot ; the maltese falcon&quot ; and & quot ; the glass key&quot ; are american classics . another , & quot ; the thin man&quot ; , inspired one of hollywood 's best-loved movie franchises . hammett 's novels lift the veil of propriety from the subcultures in which they take place , laying bare violence , corruption , and pervasive cynicism . but they 're not dreary . the sharp prose crackles , and the heroes stand apart from the corruption while swimming in it , steadfast in their own codes of conduct , their iconoclastic ideologies rooted securely in realism . these five novels all appeared as serials in magazines prior to being published as novels . & quot ; the thin man&quot ; appeared first in & quot ; redbook&quot ; , the others in & quot ; black mask&quot ; . & quot ; the maltese falcon&quot ; ( 1930 ) and & quot ; the glass key&quot ; ( 1931 ) are flawless . & quot ; the maltese falcon&quot ; features private detective sam spade , a irresistible femme fatale , and the ruthless pursuit of an ancient gold statuette . the last pages of the book are some of the most hard-hitting and cynical in all of noir fiction . and they 're brilliant . & quot ; the glass key&quot ; explores political corruption that leads to personal tragedy in an unnamed american city . oddly , the detective is the right-hand man of a crime boss . & quot ; red harvest&quot ; ( 1929 ) features the adventures of hammett 's most popular detective , the continental op , in a town called personville , or poisonville to those who know it better . the always unnamed detective for the continental detective agency finds himself responsible for cleaning up a mining town that is ruled by violence and mob warfare . the novel 's opening paragraph deserves to be read several times . & quot ; the thin man&quot ; ( 1934 ) is an attempt at humor among new york 's blue-blooded , cold-blooded upper crust . hard-boiled humor is interesting in concept . but i find the characters in this novel more pitiful than funny , and hammett 's style was in decline at this point . at least his characteristic cynicism wasn't . & quot ; the dain curse&quot ; ( 1929 ) is another continental op novel . this one is melodramatic , absurd , and not up to hammett 's usual standards . hammett fans should n't miss it , but others may find it pointless . i described the novels in order of descending quality . & quot ; complete novels&quot ; organizes them chronologically . five novels is a lot to pack into one book . but & quot ; complete novels&quot ; does n't resemble a door stop . it 's a handy size actually . the print is not too small , but the pages are quite thin . editor stanley marcus , a literary critic and frequent admirer of hammett 's work , has included a chronology of hammett 's life and several pages of notes on the novels in the back of the book . the chronology is informative and provides all of the apparently significant events in hammett 's life . the notes are mostly definitions of colloquialisms used in the novels , which are useful . the notes also contain an introduction to & quot ; the maltese falcon&quot ; , written by hammett in 1934 , in which he explains the origins of that novel 's characters . it 's quite interesting . for those who prefer to own these novels separately , vintage crime / black lizard hs published some handsome trade paperback editions . but if you want hardback and do n't mind all five novels in one volume , this is quite a nice book
camera neg 677.txt this camcorder worked well , but i had two complaints with it . 1. on the sound track you can hear noise from the recording head moving back and forth , sounds like a woodpecker . this alone made it unacceptable or what i wanted to do . 2. i wanted high quality video , but since it records on a small dvd disk , the video is compressed before it is recorded on the disk . this causes some loss of detail in the picture , especially if you 're going to edit it and rerecord the video which i need to do . if you just want a camera to record a small dvd which you can then play in a dvd player ( and not all dvd players will play the small dvds ) this camera might be acceptable . i returned it and bought a panasonic pv-gs35minidv camcorder which uses the minidv cassette tape . much better video quality because its not compressd , and no noise from the tape drive
dvd neg 332.txt i could barely get through the...um...er...reimagination...of the childern 's classic - while the set design and special fx are state of the art , as usual for a tim burton film , the actual movie is hard to watch . why ? depp 's " performance " is chock full of ticks and mannerisms , off-putting , flat , self-absorbed , and finally , one-note . rather than the quirky fun of the original 1972 gene wilder version , burton 's film is more horror than fantasy , often casually cruel and sadistic to the point of being far from family fare . while deliberate on burton 's part , that does n't make the final product any more watchable . it 's one grim , dismal , downward spiral slog . not much holidday fun , huh ? as with most of burton 's other big , expensive failures , he knows how to create a convincing world , but has no clue how to populate it with characters and situations we identify with and / or could care less about . the final result is a film that 's like a fragile , hermetically sealed curio on the shelf - nice to look at from afar , but hard to get attached to , much less involved with . what a waste of millions of studio $$$

music neg 615.txt the best scene in the movie is the italian restaurant scene with janeane garofalo , using a wry randy quaid as her foil when she 's not ignoring him . it 's the only scene that made me laugh . the scene with the playboy dad having three women in his home , and the one preceding it when his girlfriend 's excessive dinner fails to impress the little kids , are both weak . playboy dad is not interesting , and that character really should n't have been one of the three musketeers of this movie . the other dad , reiser , is uncomfortable to watch . his dinner scene with his daughter is good in the sense that it shows how estranged a father can be with his teenage daughter , but that too is uncomfortable to watch . the later scene , up in the treehouse when his daughter suddenly loves him , is completely unbelievable . the fact is , that particular girl would not say those things to her dad . she does n't love him . she does n't need him at all . she 's done with him . the stupid bit about randy quaid being a talk show star after busting into rob reiner 's talk show is just dumb . that does n't happen . if you want to write a cartoon , get warner brothers to draw it for you . have the road runner in it , or bugs bunny . the film gives us comfort food at the end , with the trite and meaningless advice to love your kids . the fact is that your kids need love from their father when they are young , but once they hit a certain age , in double digits , you are done . daddy just becomes the source of cash from then on . kids in their teens and twenties do n't want or need anything but money from dad . fittingly , i saw this film on father 's day . to sum the whole movie up , janeane garofalo is funny , randy quaid is kind of comfortable to watch although the script gets a little stupid at the tail end , and the other two male leads are just mildly annoying . the script does n't say anything worthwhile about the subject it took on . but it takes a subject on , so at least that 's something . it gives exposure and food for thought on the subject of how a father fits into his family
books neg 13.txt i agree with the reviewer who said this work is boring . it seems roth is trying to glorify philip roth and not the characters . he goes on and on describing the overwhelming feelings zuckermann has for " the swede " , without letting us know who the swede really is . roth should let the characters tell the story or try to use less erudition in his narration . it gets to the point where the reader loses interest in finishing the book . i loved the plot against american because it was more character based than philosophizing about about the historical context of the times

music neg 906.txt i deeply love the music of joni mitchell . it is for this reason that i feel the need to warn you , to dissuade you from being too early enthusiastic about this album aven before having heard it ( as i stupidly did ) . the fact is that so many people spend so much energy in praising it ( a new mature joni ! a return to the roots ! a brilliant acoustic album ! and nonsense like these.. . ) that it is very disappointing and frustrating to see ( well , hear ) that joni has not changed from her foolish and useless music of the last 15 years ( except " dog eat dog " which is superb , but only from a lyrical point of view - musically it 's an ' 80s disaster ) . it is the first joni mitchell album that i felt spleepy listening . ok , some lyrics are quite good , but nothing compares to the joni of the ' 60s and ' 70s . so , i really do not get the point : it is so obvious to me that she has nothing left to say ( how painful it is to face reality ! ) , so , why should all of you praise her ? just because of what she did in the past ? ok , let us say that she was the greatest singer-songwriter of her generation ( according to me , much better than bob dylan ) and let us praise her forever because of that ; but i truly cannot accept that we still flatter her in everything she does , even if what she does is boring and flat music pretending to be art . i would like to strongly dissuade you from buying this album ( and anything else from 1982 up to now - except , as i said , " dog eat dog " ) . if you are still trying to introduce yourself through the divine music of joni mitchell , try anything you want from the 60s and 70s . really , anything . try to be open-minded and let her music flow through your veins . you have to be prepared , for it could be beautifully dangerous : once you know her , you will never let her go away from your soul

books pos 473.txt this book has a lot of insights about various ways in which the ' pace of life and learning ' have since the scientific revolution accelerated . in other words it is a book which gives one much to think about . the problem is that it also suggests that given the vast increase of information available to us , the vast increase in ' possible alternatives ' for our attention , that we will probably have our minds moved away from the insights so rapidly as to not even absorb them . the obvious reply to such an intense barrage upon our consciousness , is to withdraw . and when we withdraw and close out all that is accelerating around us , we begin to try and make a pace and story of our own within ourselves . the faster we are forced to go , the slower we may need to go . i think a companion volume , or perhaps a contradictory volume should be written on all those human activities which might be aided by our ' going slower in them' . and along with this volume should be advice and recommendation of how to keep out of our life these seemingly endless intrusions which disrupt our living by our own rhythm . " run slowly , slowly horses of the night "

books pos 318.txt at first , i found this book to be difficult to digest because it appeared to be heading in a direction that was in sacrilegious conflict with my beliefs as a christian and a catechist in the catholic church . yet a part of me was also highly fascinated and captivated by the story , especially since i work as a mental health professional . as i keep reading , i discovered that it was n't sacrilegious at all but rather a story of general faith and hope , of the extent a mother would go through to protect her child , and of the intrusive nature of the media . i particularly liked the strength mariah showed during this conflict , despite her past history of nervous breakdown . and i like the way the character of ian evolved from a sleazy teleaetheist to a caring and more moral man . the secondary characters were all wonderful , in particular mariah 's mother and the lawyers on both side . i thought the trial was once of the most interesting parts of the story . as with all picoult books , this was a deep and heavy novel which was n't easily breezed through , but it was definitely a compelling and awesome book to read !

camera neg 585.txt i have to say that i really wanted to like this camera . it takes good pictures and the ultra-wide lens is a nice feature . it is quite compact and has a nice screen . the software is reasonably good and has a nice presentation to the user interface . why 2 stars ? ok here 's the bad stuff : 1 ) in the first shipment i got , the normal mode ( non-ultra-wide angle ) did n't work . the images were garbled and almost unrecognizable . the ultra-wide images were fine . i attributed it to getting a random lemon and returned it for an even exchange . the second v570 i got from amazon worked fine until about 5 months later and then the normal mode crapped out on me . so , i do n't think it is just a random problem . there appears to be a reliability issue with the non-wide angle part of this camera since it seems statistically unlikely that i would randomly get two cameras with the exact same problem . my v570 is now a nice-looking paperweight and i use a casio exilim ex-z70. 2 ) the stand seemed nice at first until it came time to travel . you have to unhook the whole thing and lug it around with you if you want to charge your camera or download pictures and movies without a card reader dongle . also , since you have to charge the battery in the camera , you ca n't charge a spare battery while you are taking pictures with the other . for comparison , my new casio ex-z70 has a usb cable that is easy to stick in the pocket of my bag and has an external battery charger . so , if one battery is dead i can leave it behind in the charger while i take pictures with the spare . 3 ) the movies that you take with this camera are stored in mov format instead of avi or mpeg . while it does play in most pcs if you have installed quicktime , it is not supported by my streaming media player ( d-link dsm-320rd ) and is difficult to work with in the video editor / dvd creator sw i use ( sonic mydvd ) . i ca n't say how widely mov is supported compared to avi and mpeg , but that format created problems for me . so , i applaud kodak for not clinging to the sinking boat anchor of the photographic film business and going digital . but i think a few more usability studies and more attention to reliability would help make this a winner in future iterations

music neg 797.txt i remember really liking this album when it was first released , even though i could tell it was not in the same league as the real thing or angel dust . listening to the album now , i realise it is by far the worst fnm album since mike patton joined . the whole album feels very rushed , it has a sparse , raw sound , very different to angel dust 's polish . the music is generally very simple with many tracks sounding like b-sides and lacks the consistent melodiousness and sense of rhythm of their previous two classic albums . it was a shame to see guitarist jim martin depart . he had an unmistakable style and crunching guitar sound and was an integral part of fnm 's style and make up . however , being replaced ( for a short time anyway ) by trey spruance is no bad thing - anyone familiar with his work with mr bungle will know he is a genius with a guitar and his work here on king for a day is excellent , it 's just a shame that the material he has to work with is largely uninspired . how ironic then that on such a disappointing album , fnm produce one of their greatest ever tracks - the title track is pure genius , full of the care and effort , rhythm and melodiousness fnm were famous for . beginning with a great bass riff and acoustic strum , it is soon joined by a gentle female voice effect and simple minor piano scale and then brilliantly builds into a tour de force of percussion and guitar work before cleverly returning to the gentle acoustic sounds of the intro where it carefully takes 2 and a half minutes to wind down beautifully - this is fnm as you 'd expect them . another track that deserves special mention is cuckoo or caca , a great metal piece with excellent percussion and keyboards and crazy vocals . it 's scorching and funy and another reminder of the greatness fnm once held in abundance . it 's just a shame that these moments of inspiration are surrounded by so much surprising blandness ( caralho voador , take this bottle , the last to know ) and 2nd rate metal ( ugly in the morning , what a day , get out ) . star a.d. could have been vintage fnm but in the end falls flat , evidence starts off interestingly enough but soon gets boring and metal tracks like ricochet , the gentle art of making enemies and digging the grave are simple and sound like what most student bands are writing . however , the album does end on another note of vintage fnm - just a man is funny and catchy with patton having fun doing his tom jones impression and the inclusion of a gospel choir at the end is inspired - you find yourself not wanting it to end . patton 's vocals throughout the album are still amazing but should be accompanying much better material and you ca n't help but feel he was a little bored here - i think his heart always really lay with the far superior mr bungle , where he really shone and where his voice was absolutely perfect for the complex and avant garde material . i suppose it 's not surprising that king for a day is a largely empty affair , the departure of jim martin and the diminished presence of roddy bottum at rehearsals meant that fnm 's original chemistry and resources were sadly lacking and so were unable to achieve what they once had been able to . it 's really an album for faith no more fans , it 's certainly no classic despite some classic material and i feel it was the beginning of the end for fnm , they would improve with their next album , album of the year - but only marginally .

music neg 750.txt the versions of " black sabbath " and " war pigs " actually comprise half of black sabbath 's appearance on the april 26 , 1970 edition of john peel 's ' sunday show . ' " black sabbath " features a unique third verse that appears on no other officially released version of the song . " war pigs " is actually " walpurgis , " an earlier incarnation of the song featuring entirely different lyrics . incidentally , the other two songs from that broadcast , " fairies wear boots " and " behind the wall of sleep , " were released as bonus tracks on the supplemental disc issued with the first pressings of the original 1997 release . all four of these tracks , while fascinating , do n't rightfully belong on this collection , as this disc intends to highlight ozzy osbourne 's career as a solo artist . for that reason , the live version of " paranoid " that appears on this set is equally unnecessary . those songs are frustrating inclusions on an ozzy osbourne greatest hits album , particularly since they come at the apparent exclusion of some of ozzy 's biggest hits and / or notable tracks such as " flying high again , " " shot in the dark , " " i do n't know , " " breaking all the rules , " or " road to nowhere . " to add to the confusion , some of the solo-era material included here is n't exactly what it purports to be . ozzy has been the subject of a number of recent legal disputes over writing and performance royalties . these disputes ostensibly prompted ozzy to reissue his back catalog in 2002 with , in some cases , re-recorded tracks . the ' blizzard of ozz ' and ' diary of a madman ' albums now feature pointlessly re-recorded rhythm parts , presumably as a snub to the original rhythm section of lee kerslacke ( drums ) and bob daisley ( bass ) , who , incidentally , wrote the lyrics to almost every ozzy solo track from ' blizzard of ozz ' through ' no more tears . ' the ' bark at the moon ' album , while not re-recorded , was most certainly remixed . it is the re-recorded versions of the ' blizzard of ozz ' and ' diary of a madman ' tracks and the remixed version of the ' bark at the moon ' track that appear on the current edition of this collection . finally , the version of " no more tears " is actually the video edit , not the album version . in addition , due to one of the disputes mentioned above , ' the ultimate sin ' album was not selected for remastering in 2002 and has subsequently been dropped from ozzy 's catalog . that album 's biggest hit , " shot in the dark , " which appeared on the original 1997 release of this collection , has now been replaced with " miracle man " from ' no rest for the wicked . ' along these lines , the ' just say ozzy ' live ep and the double-disc live album , ' live and loud , ' both of which contain a live version of " shot in the dark , " have also been deleted from ozzy 's catalog . not even ' the essential ozzy osbourne , ' a double-disc collection covering ozzy 's entire solo career , features a single song from ' the ultimate sin . ' the ultimate sin , indeed . my recommendation is to avoid this collection ( and the 2002 remasters ) and instead search for the 1995 remasters or , better yet , search for the original albums on vinyl
books neg 581.txt written in cartoon format , i thought this book would be a lighter approach to a straight , dry , biography of scientists . however , it is written more like a series of political cartoons than cartoons for kids . the cartoons are barely understandable if the biography of the scientist is not already known , so using it as an initial reading is impossible . further , some content is offensive . on the second page of cartoons , a scientist is walking along a bridge , thinking , when someone mistakenly believes he is getting ready to jump , saying , " no woman is worth committing suicide over . " the pictures show a scantily-clad woman ( with bare bottom in one frame ) that he is now picturing in his mind . irrelevant and inappropriate ! plus , i did n't have to go far to find swear words in the captions . yikes ! my kids will never see this book ! it is not even appropriate for high-school age kids . ( in fact , it is n't even funny to adults !
camera neg 145.txt polarizing filters are used to eliminate glare on non-metallic surfaces like glass or water . they can also be used to increase the contrast and color saturation of your image . i use my polarizer not only to eliminate glare , but also to make skies a nice shade of blue or to get some " pop " out of clouds . there are so many options to consider when purchasing the polarizing filter for your needs . for instance , linear vs. circular , film or digital versions , or quality vs. price . if you are making use of a ttl or auto-focusing system , circular polarizers are designed to work with those features . linear polarizers has their uses , but they are manufactured differently and may not work . unless you are certain , just get a circular polarizing filter . there are some digital circular polarizers on the market . i am not sure what makes a cir-pl lens better for digital as opposed to film . i use a canon 20d digital slr and see no problems caused by using a supposed non-digital filter on a digital camera . most of the time , when it comes to filters ; you get what you pay for . does that mean you need an expensive polarizer ? of course not , just be sure to get the right filter for your needs . what ever polarizing filter you get , make sure it is color neutral to prevent unwanted tinting . spending more on a color balanced filter will save time in post . if you need multiple filter sizes , consider saving money by using step down rings . currently i use the hoya pro1 filters , as the canon polarizing filters i previously owned were without question bulkier and heavier . the weight might not seem like much , but when you stick all your items in a backpack all the extra bits of weight add up quickly . i can spend a good amount of time with my equipment on my back so this is a big concern for me . when it came down to the images , at times i would see a browning tint on my photos . the tint is easy to clean up in photoshop cs2 , but i do n't see that problem with the hoya pro1 filter . overall , i would recommend against the canon polarizing filters . i originally thought , " it is canon , it must be quality . " since then i have replaced all my canon filters . this filter works , but comes at a cost of disadvantages to other similarly priced filters . pros : can be used for film or digital cameras eliminates internal reflections and ghosting cons : bulky and heavy not neutral color balance
dvd neg 862.txt the strange and baffling career of cuba gooding takes another dive in this attempt to mirror the success of denzel 's training day . unfortunately , cuba 's not denzel and this movie is way below the quality of day . filled with enough foul language to fill the pacific ocean , the movie attempts to be artsy but is merely another bad cop movie , filled with bad cops- --where 's the good ones ? clifton collins jr. , so good in capote , is wasted in the role of the apparently honest partner of cuba who is going to testify in internal affairs regarding the killing of an innocent bystander during a drug bust . all though this cuba swaggers like a rap star and collins has to try and act tough with him . there 's an unusual twist in the end and a very long russian roulette sequence that do nothing to redeem this disappointing film
music pos 118.txt rem has had a helluva lot of hits , and has remained a radio staple and has been a big influence on later bands . this 18-track album does a good job for its length , but i really do feel a 2-cd hit package is warranted . the biggest omissions are " shiny happy people , " " it 's the end of the world as we know it , " and " this one goes out to the one i love . " it would n't surprise me if the band did n't really like these songs and would rather not include them in their greatest hits collection . however , there are a few other more minor hits i know from them that are missing , like " radio free europe . " i just ca n't think of other titles right now , but there are more than a few other omissions too . many of the minor hits that are included here , thankfully , are very good and will grow well on you : " the great beyond , " " bad day , " " all the way to reno , " " e-bow the letter , " and " imitation of life " are songs i have n't heard enough of and i 'm glad they are on this collection . still , i hear rem is coming out with another compilation and i imagine it will be more complete ; i suggest waiting for that album when it comes out

software neg 671.txt having used turbo tax since 1990 i feel that i am qualified to comment on it . i have also used quicken , quicken deluxe , quicken home & business , quickbooks pro 2003 & quickbooks premier contractors edition . the turbo tax product seems to get more user un-friendly each year . the navigation features do not allow as much mobility thru the program as they did in the late nineties and early 2000's . like i said i was using quickbooks pro 2003 until tax time last year . i purchased turbo tax home & business like i had for the past 4 years , and really got a shock when i found out that it would not import my data from quickbooks pro 2003. three year old software that was not compatible with turbo tax in 2006 ( actually 2005 tax year ) . i ended up purchasing quickbooks premier contractors edition 2006 ( $280+ ) in order to upgrade just to get my taxes done . intuit in my opinion is a perfect example of major corporate greed . i am done with them and will purchase taxcut this year
music neg 352.txt this cd is the worst " comedy " cd i have ever heard . yet the reviews on here mostly claim it was hilarious ? ? ? ? ok , i 've come to the conclusion , the only people writing positive reviews on amazon must be the people trying to sell the junk . i 've seen this guy on some tv shows , and on comedy central , and he 's a somewhat funny guy , but it is painful to listen to this cd . you can feel the awkwardness of the crowd , not knowing if or when to laugh . and it continues throughout the entire cd . there do n't seem to be any jokes on the cd at all . it is all disconnected negative rants from a bitter angry human being . do n't believe me ? then go ahead and waste your money on this horrible piece of junk , and see for yourself . like my review title says , do not read the positive reviews . just read the negative ones , and decide how credible they seem . then make your decision to buy or not buy
music neg 636.txt it just amazes me what a joke the music industry has become . nowadays anyone can become a singer take for instance : ashlee simpson , lindsay lohan , and now paris hilton ? lmao ! no seriously though , i 'm still totally not sure how paris hilton became so famous . yes , i know she 's the hilton hotel heiress , but i 'm not sure why the media gives her so much attention . all she did was live off her family fortune , but now thanks to that fortune , she was able to get the right contacts , to make her own record label called " heiress records " which is a sub-label of warner bros . after a reality show series , modeling career , a sex tape , and a couple of roles in a few movies , what did she think to herself ? i think i want to be a singer now ? apparently . and thats how this flaming pile of garbage came about . " stars are blind " is her first single off her debut album " paris " and let me tell you it 's nothing new or original . the song has kind of a ska beat , which i really do n't think much of . her voice sounds like when you inhale helium from a balloon , and the lyrics are mediocre . sorry paris , but you failed miserably as a musician . leave this profession for the people that really have the talent

music neg 461.txt in the classic and disturbing 1972 movie deliverance , lewis ( burt reynolds ) gives this ominous warning to ed ( jon voigt ) : " machines are going to fail . systems are going to fail . then.. . survival . " what , i wonder , will richard d . james ( a.k.a. aphex twin , a.k.a. afx ) do when the machines fail ? it 's been nearly five years since his underappreciated album drukqs , where we got a tantalizing possible answer to this question : the plaintive , lovely , satie-esque acoustic keyboard nocturnes intermingled among the abstract , frantic electronic soundscapes throughout its sprawling duration . [another intriguing solution was proposed on the album acoustica : alarm will sound performs aphex twin...] chosen lords , rdj 's first proper cd release since then , is actually a collection of various tracks from his " analord series " of overpriced , elaborately packaged 12-inch vinyl singles that he 's been cranking out over the last year or so . those who were put off by the excesses and overt eccentricity of drukqs may hail these cryptically titled , drum-machine laden compositions as a " return to greatness . " indeed , afx is certainly reviving a more compact , accessible ( for him ) , and straightforward style here , with comparatively regular ( though not quite danceable ) rhythms and those comforting underlying simple synthesizer melodies . i have to say , though , that there 's a disappointing and somewhat melancholy sense here of a great musical mind spinning its wheels . by returning to such familiar ground he seems to be setting up systems and letting them run their course in an almost cynical way , without any of the maniacal glee that was once part of his singular musical personality on unforgettable releases like come to daddy , windowlicker , the richard d . james album , and , yes - - drukqs . notably lacking are the voices that once regularly appeared in his productions - - true , they were usually rather unsettling , distorted , and manipulated voices , but at least they added some welcome humanity . also missing are those rare but beautiful moments of repose ( ballads ? ) such as " flim , " " nannou " and the striking piano interludes on drukqs . in the end , chosen lords , while an undeniably interesting and expertly produced collection of electronic music , is nonetheless a sterile , static , joyless affair . if it inspires any emotion at all , it will probably be pity and sadness as you listen to a possible musical genius coasting along without exploring any new directions for the first time in his otherwise remarkable career . yes , i 'm afraid the machines have failed richard d . james , and i sincerely hope he can survive in this cold and remote musical wilderness of his own creation. .
software neg 119.txt the description of this product on the amazon site does not match what i received . like another reviewer mentioned , the product was actually shipped from the uk so it took longer , and several features listed as being in the product are not there , specifically , exporting / saving of loops is not allowed , and there is no library of 1000+ loops included either . it seems to me to be basically like a demo version . also , even though it was advertised as being new in the box , all i got was what looks like a ( used ) cd with no manual or cd key - so much for upgrading later ! i am returning it . the sku should be removed from amazon or the description should be changed to fit what is actually being sent out
books pos 374.txt this book is a somewhat linear history of the past 13 , 000 years across the continents . diamond seeks to sum up history across various societies on all the continents in a relatively short volume . the impetus for this search starts with a question from a friend of his from new guinea named yali . yali 's question was , " why is it that you white people developed so much cargo and brought it to new guinea , but we black people had little cargo of our own ? " reading the book , i think i gulped at this point . this sounds like a classic , loaded question . it sounds disturbingly close to why have we ( europe and its former colonies ) succeeded where they have failed . diamond does not descend into that territory though , but he does not evade criticism for skirting it completely . there are references to a culture 's success in industrializing or condensing populations that diamond brushes off as a mixed blessing , for instance . the advantages of a hunting / gathering culture are not really explored outside of the remarkable sustaining nature of southeast asia . this history can probably be described ( or perhaps is most successful ) as based around environmental causation ( as opposed to the racial / ethnic / social causation that the lump in my throat had been fearing ) . descriptions of climate ( note : that the history begins with the cessation of the last great ice age ) , longitudinal or latitudinal axes , elevation and landmass differences play a strong role in determining the fate of humanity . still , it is interesting to look specifically at the items gathered in the title . guns . europe 's refinement of this technology was based on china 's innovations with gunpowder . today 's dominant society is a product as much of what it has swallowed and thus incorporated as by what it has innovated . as an interesting counterpoint , japan had owned more and better guns in c . 1600 ce , than any country in the world . samurai rulers first limited then outlawed the technology . japan would n't resume manufacture until mid 19th century . obviously , there is an indisputable importance in the weaponry 's influence in shaping the geopolitical world of today . germs . epidemics left people from cultures based on cities with who could resist smallpox and those dense populations more easily replaced those who did n't survive . smaller groups have a distinct disadvantage versus the interdependent and consequently more interchangable larger cities . epidemics develop out of these civilizations as germs jump over from domesticated animals ( and smaller groups may not even have animals to domesticate ) . interesting note : the emperors of the mayan and incan civilizations both succumb to disease ( likely smallpox ) rather than guns . steel . technological advancement is keyed on innovations brought about by dense populations and the possibility for abstraction of responsibilities . a hunter-gatherer culture lacks the abstraction necessary to divide responsibilities to allow for such developments as literacy and mining , as the energies that would fuel these are directed toward survival areas . diamond makes an interesting and controversial point that the hunter-gatherer culture may be more attuned to intelligence as an evolutionary necessity over civilized society , where the evolutionary energy may be directed at surviving these epidemic illnesses . there are many aspects of environment that serve as limiting conditions for the development of these things . first , there appears to need to be sustainable farming . many of the staples of modernity are the crops first domesticated in the fertile crescent region ( where today we invade , suck oil , and force the conquered to endure freedom ) . the western asian breadbasket provided the means to bank food so that trades could develop . as a complete side note , the genesis book of the bible can be viewed upon through this filter as it goes into great detail how joseph set up a system of storing and meting grain in egypt to greatly increase the population and avoid the calamity of drought and famine brought on by sustenance farming . another factor in the civilizing of eurasia is the landmass itself . compared to africa and the americas , eurasia is mainly west-east axis versus north-south . movement of successes in cultivation and domestication could more easily occur because climate differences are easier on a latitudinal basis than on longitudinal . something like corn ( maize ) which was domesticated in central americas took a very long time to make it to north america because of geography . llamas and guinea pigs ( which could be useful for pack animals and food ) never made it north . conversely , all those fertile crescent crops and bigger domesticated animals like cattle , horses , pigs were able to spread from one tip of asia to the opposite tip of europe . to answer yali 's question , some of the answer is luck . africa , australia and the americas may not have been afforded the botanical or zoological advantages that eurasia had . some other is environmental determinism , where you are helps make up who you become . for going forward , diamond cites transportation , communication and information advances as factors that likely will obliviate these historical forces in the future . after word : harpers magazine tackles an issue that was brought up , but not as fully developed here , that of pre-clovis native american discoveries ( pronouncements ) , knowingly confronting a loaded racial / ethnocentric question in a folio called " might white of you : are american archaeologists white supremacists ? " the archaeological records supports people living in the americas since about 9000-11000 bce . there are scant scraps of evidence prior to that date , but plenty of theories typically more titillating than substantive . one wonders if the pre-clovis discovery ( especially all the business about " caucusoid " skulls ) , is n't so much about archaeology as setting up an imagined genocide to justify a documented genocide .

music pos 364.txt as a fan of both celtic traditional and bluegrass music i was wary of a cd claiming to be a hybrid - too often it means an unsatisfactory compromise where original flavours become watered down and insipid . i need not have worried - tim o'brien has produced one of the most amazing and rewarding musical journeys i 've followed for some time . not only do the players from the two traditions blend instinctively and harmoniously but the tracks , mostly songs , are marvellous vehicles for new and exciting directions . there are superb performances all round , vocally from o'brien with guests paul brady , maura o'connell , kathhy mattea , del mccoury etc and musicians altan , frankie gavin , jerry douglas , earl scruggs , seamus egan and a host of others and the sound is fresh , acoustic and vital , requiring no production gimmicks or effects . standout songs for me personally are & quot ; mountaineer is always free&quot ; , & quot ; lost little children&quot ; , & quot ; wandering&quot ; and & quot ; john riley&quot ; although there is not a weak track on the cd . it is obvious that for tim o'brien this has been a labour of love . if you like acoustic music , from any tradition , either side of the atlantic , you 'll love it . several of my friends have bought it on my recommendation and agree it is brilliant

dvd neg 412.txt the first was one of the best thrillers ever , with clever suspence , good characters , decent acting and awesome effects . this one is.. . meh . why must you make a sequel to a huge success hit and turn the franchise into a straight-to-video series ? what 's the bloody point ? now there are some good parts . the rooms are pretty nice and the musice score is decent , but you know , that does n't even save it . this movie is a annoying , pointless and downright piece of crap that only kids can easily love . it is so un-intelligent it really makes you wanna puke . the characters are nothing but cardboard cut-outs . i do n't even know them well . all they do is scream , run around in the cube rooms and cannot keep their mouths shut . i also really hate the effects in this one as well . they felt like they were over-used . there is even a scene where a guy gets cut into peices and look how badly done it was . the direction is ok , but when it comes to adding wierdness , it 's too much . i do n't understand the story , there 's a strange sex-scene which a cube movie does not need . cube is about suspence . this one is just about adding too much effects , a four-dimensional cube and trying to make itself look better than the first one . you do n't need that stuff . if you wanted to make a sequel better than the first , add something original , do n't take itself too seriously and make sure it stays true to the original . but no , you just had to add all this unoiriginal time crap and have alot of special effects taking over and even a sex scene which is not cool because if it 's a cube movie , you do n't need nudity . overall , if you wanna kill off some time by watching this crap , go ahead . i know you like watching people getting killed in unoriginal ways and watching sex scenes . if you 're a fan of cube , dont ' bother . acting : 3 / 10 ugh , do n't get me started . these actors have bad acting skills and i hope they die . gore factor : 4 / 10 cgi gore ? ! come on ! ? t&a : 1 / 10 a cube movie does n't need nudity and they do n't know that because they do n't know cube . direction : 7 / 10 andrzej sekula did have some visual eye in some parts . i did enjoy a few scenes and i dug the rooms , but you know , i ca n't say he 's a great director . he turned the franchise with straight-to-video written all over it . bottom line : if you wanna watch , go ahead , then you 'll be sorry . this movie is just sad . it does n't try anything to impress you because it 's idiotic . lets hope andrzej sekula learned his lesson and should never do a sequel to an impressive indipendent film again
software pos 757.txt i bought bhg deluxe 7.0 software to plan an addition . i talked to the companies and shopped around before purchasing . i did not talk to imsi about floor plan 3d , i gave up after trying to get through to a human . i would bet a guess the software is as good as imsi 's telephone skills . i talked to punch software and was warned away from their product by their own tech as i have integrated video on my computer . apparently you need a video card with a minimum of video memory to render drawings with any usable speed using punch software . punch software 's loss , not mine as that 's a ridiculous issue for a consumer software product . chief architect offered a money back guarantee for their better homes and gardens products , even if purchased via vendors like amazon . i 'll keep this better homes and gardens home designer deluxe software , even though it does have it 's annoying quirks . even for a lesser package from the pro version , the library of items it very limited . i would guess there are quite a few more in the pro version , but it is odd to not include more of the most standard items that many home owners would need when laying out a home . you learn to just use a nearly matched symbol to fill the space , even though it is not the correct symbol or size of item . since i am not interested in the 3d view , this is not a big issue for me . the item i needed most was floorplanning . 3d modeling is an extra item that i may play with , but is not essential for me personally . if you are truly interested in the 3d aspect , this is an issue . i would recommend visiting the product forum to see what is the best choice . [...] for quick and easy floor plan software with a few extras , this software does better than ok . no experience necessary , and the short tutorial videos will get you started quickly . i have issues with not being able to have more control of wall types , and there are some odd roof design limitations even for a mid to low priced consumer package . these are annoying enough to urge an upgrade to pro if you want more control of all aspects . since i will be laying out the floor plan , then turning it over to an architect with real softare , it 's not a problem for me . i have had a few restarts due to drawings getting all wild and messed up , but by ignoring the autosaved drawings , i was able to go back to my last manually saved drawing and start from a known good point . this software does have upgrade options to download from the company site . just like any good software company , they do provide spftware patches to download . i would definately recommend this software as a quick way to do floor plans . adding walls , doors , windows , and other items is very simple . just do n't plan on perfection , as it 's based on prefabbed walls and is limited to whole inches , not fractions . angles are an issue as well . if you need specific angles , this is not the package , it does preset increments only . i wish it had default preferences a user could select as well . being able to preset your roofing style preferences or other items would eliminate quite a bit of redo's . i hope the software companies read these reviews . there is alot of good information on how to improve the products .

camera pos 464.txt i always say that there is technology you can use and technology you can impress others with . this model helps you do both . you have a nice 5.1 mp still camera and mpegmovie4tv video . the very fact that you have a camera which you can take both still pictures and video is huge . i never had a video camera before because i hate to carry two camera and a big camera case , so this was the obvious solution . i realize that instead of embracing the moment ( for which they need the memory ) most people often juggle between cameras . cons : * sometimes people might confuse it with camera phone * buttons are harder to find * software is not the best * wish had more zoom pros : * convince * compact * battery lasts long * flash is good * video sound quality is good i wonder why this model has not swept the market - another story of good product and mad marketing
books neg 486.txt in the commencement mr. utterson and his cousin mr. richard enfield were walking throughout london . the men go by a mysterious cellar door , and then mr. enfield talked about a story that ensue here previously . also later in the book utterson work to help dr. jekyll from being brung into the ghastly tribulations of mr. hydes . one year later , edward hyde viciously murders sir danvers carew by thrashing him to death with a cane . i did not like this book because it was a high level booklover so i could not concentrate . i 'd propose this book for high scholar for that reason , and if you 're a person who reads allot . the genre was good because it was sci-fi and it seems sci-fi is a little more addicting . the author is a pretty well known writer his name is robert louis stevenson .

language ` ` ` ` ambition is the death of thought'''  these three quotes are from ludwig wittgenstein who redefined philosophysome70 years ago ( but most people have yet to find this out ) .dennett , though he has been a philosopher for some40 years , is one them. it is also curious that both he and his prime antagonist , john searle , studied under famous wittgensteinians ( searle with john austin , dennett with gilbert ryle ) but searle got the point and dennett did not . dennett is a hard determinist ( though he trys to sneak reality in the back door ) , and perhaps this is due to ryle , whose famous book ' the concept of mind ' ( 1949 ) continues to be reprinted . that book did a great job of exorcising the ghost but it left the machine . dennett enjoys making the mistakes wittgenstein , ryle ( andmany others since ) have exposed in detail . byaccident , just before this book , i had read ' 'the minds i' ' , which dennett coauthored withdouglas hofstadter in 1981. they made some bad mistakes ( see my review ) , and saddest of all , they reprinted twofamous articles that pointed the wayout of the mess- --nagel's  ` what is like to be a bat ? ` and an early version of john searle's  chinese room argument explaining why computers do n't think. nagel pointed out that we do noteven know how to recognize whata concept of a bat 's mind would be like. searle similarly explained how we lack a way to conceptualize thinking and how itdiffersfrom what a computer does ( eg , it can translate chinese without understanding it ) . likewise , we lack a clear test for recognizing what countsas good vs bad- -or just intelligible- - for many philosophical and scientific concepts. our use of the words consciousness , choice , freedom , intention , particle ,  thinking ,  determines , wave , cause , happened , event ( and so on endlessly )  are rarely a source of confusion but as soon as we leave normal life and enter philosophy ( and anydiscussion detached from the environment in which language evolved )  chaos reigns. wittgenstein was the first to understand why and to point out how to avoid this . unfortunately , he died inhis prime , his works are composed almost entirely of a series of examples of how the mind ( language ) worksand he never wroteany popular books , so understanding of his work is restricted to a very few . searle is one of the world 's leadingphilosophers and has written manyextremely clear and highly regarded articles and books , some of which have pointed out the glaring defects in dennett's work.his review ` ` consciousness explained away' ' of dennetts 1991 book ` ' consciousness explained''  and his book ''the mystery of consciousness' ' are very well known , and show , in a way that isamazingly clear for philosophical writing , why neither dennett ( nor any of the hundreds of philosophersandscientists who have written on this topic ) havecome closetoexplaining the hard problem- -ie , how do you conceptualizeconsciousness.many suspect we will never be able to conceptualizeany of the reallyimportant things , but it isclear that we are nowhere near it now. dennett has mostly ignored his critics but has favored searle with vituperative personal attacks.searle has been accused by dennett and others of being out to destroy cognitive psychology which is quite funny as modern philosophy is ( mostly ) a branch of cognitive psychology and searle has made it very clear for 30 years that we are a good example of a biological machine that is conscious , thinks , etc , . he just points out that we do n't have any idea how this happens . searle characterizes as ' 'intellectualpathology' ' , the views ofdennett andall those who denythe existence of thevery phenomena they setout to explain. dennett repeats his mistakes here andleaves his reply to his critics to the penultimate page of the book , where we are told that they areall mistaken and it is a waste of spaceto show how !  unsurprisingly , there isnot one reference towittgenstein or searle in theentire book.there arehowever , many references to other old schoolphilosophers who are as confusedas he is. like most people , it does not cross his mindthatthe very inference engineshe thinks with are forcinghim to cometo certainconclusions and that these will oftenbe quite unconnectedwith or wrong about the way things are in the world . they are a jumble of evolutionary curiositieswhich do various tasks in organizing behavior that were useful for survivalhundreds of thousands of years ago.wittgenstein was a pioneerin doingthought experiments in cognitive psychologyand beganto elucidate the nature of these engines and the subtletiesof language in the 30 's , and thus he made the sorts of commentsthat this review begins with. dennett says ( p98 ) that his view is compatibilism , ie , that free will ( whichi hopewe can equate with choice ) is compatible with determinism ( ie , that ''there is at any instant exactly one physically possible future'' --p25 ) . he wants to show that determinism is not the same as inevitablity. however , the whole book is smoke and mirrors by means of which choice , in the sense we normally understand it , disappears and we are left with ` ` choice ` ` , which is something we cannot choose. naturally , this echoes the fate of consiousness in his earlier book ` ` consciousness explained ` ` . it is remarkable that , at a time when we are just beginning to reach the point where we might be able to understand the basics of how a single neuron works ( or how an atom works for that matter ) , that anyone should think they can make the leap to understanding the whole brain and to explain its most complex phenomena. please recall the last sentence of wittgenstein from the opening quote : ' ' and what's more , this satisfies a longing for thetranscendent , because , insofar aspeoplethinkthey can see ` the limits of human understanding ' , theybelieve of course thatthey can see beyond these . ` ` the relation between language ,  thought and reality is extraordinarily complex and everyone gets lost. if one is very , very careful , some understanding is possible , but dennett throws caution to the winds and we are dragged into the quicksand. there are at least 3 different topics here ( evolution of our brain , choice and morality ) and dennett tries vainly to weld them together into a coherent account of how freedom evolves from the deterministic crashing of atoms. there is , however , no compelling reason to accept that bouncing atoms ( or his favorite example , the game of life running on a computer ) are isomorphic with reality. he knows that quantum indeterminacy ( or the uncertainty principle ) is a major obstacle to determinism however defined ( and has been taken by many as an escape to freedom ) but dismisses it due to the fact that such events are too rare to bother with. by extension ,  its unlikely that any such event will happen now or even in our whole lifetime in our brain , so we appear to be stuck with a determined brain ( whatever that may be ) . however , the universe is a big place and its been around a long time ( perhaps forever ) and if even one such quantum effect occurs it would seem to throw the whole universe into an indeterminate state. the notion ' 'there is at any instant exactly one physically possible future' ' cannot be true if at any instant a quantum indeterminacy can occur- -in this case there would seem to be infinitely many possible futures. this recalls one of the escapes from the contradictions of physics- -each instant our universe is branching into infinitely many universes . he correctly rejects the idea that quantum indeterminacy gives us the answer to how we can have choice . this obvious idea has been suggested by many but the problem is that nobody has any idea how to specify an exact sequence of steps which starts with the equations of physics and ends up with the phenomena of consciousness ( or any other emergent phenomenon ) . if so , they will definitely win at least one nobel prize , for not only will they have explained consciousness , they will have explained the universal phenomenon of emergence ( how higher order properties emerge from lower ones ) . so , they would have to solve the ' easy ' problem ( to determine the exact state of the brain corresponding to some mental state and preferably specify the exact position of all the atoms in the brain over time-ignoring uncertainty ) and the ' hard ' one ( what exactly correlates with or produces consciousness or choice etc ? ) . and while they are at it how about also doing the impossible- -an exact and full solution to the quantum field equations for a brain . it is very well known that these equations are uncomputable , even for one atom or a vacuum , as it would require an infinite amount of computer time . but infinite will do for one atom so maybe a brain will take no longer . he starts off on the first page appealing to the laws of physics for protection against fantastic notions such as immaterial souls , but physics is made of notions just as fantastic ( uncertainty ,  entanglement , wave / particle duality , schrodinger 's dead / alivecat etc ) and as feynmann said many times ` ` nobody understandsphysics ! ' ' many think nobody ever will . on pg 2 he says our values have little to do with the goals of our cells and on pg 2 to3 that our personality differences are due to how our ' 'robotic teams are put togther , over a lifetime of growth and experience . ` `  this is a bald dismissal of human nature , of the abundant evidence that our differences are to a large extent programmed into our genes and fixed in early childhood , and is typical of his constant confused wandering back and forth between determinism and environmentalism . on page 9 he notes that free will is a problem and our attitudes to it make a difference , but for whom ?  nobody but philosophers. we make choices. what 's the problem ?  one has to step outside life to experience a problem and then everything becomes a problem. what are consciousness ,  pain ,  yellow , intention , matter , quarks , gravity etc. ?  i doubt that anyone has ever experienced a fundamental change in their interactions with people or their decision making processes due to their thinking about choice. this shows that there is something strange about such questions. wittgenstein would probably say that the language games are different. there are games for language connected with the cognitive templates for decisions or seeing colors etc , and thinking philosophically is operating them in decoupled mode. decoupled modes permit thinking about the past , planning for the future ,  guessing the mental states of others , etc , but if one takes the results in the wrong way and starts to think ` ' john will try to steal my wallet' ' , rather than just imagining that john might do it , confusion enters and those who cannot turn off the decoupled mode or distinguish it from coupled mode , enter the realm of pathology. some aspects of schizophrenia and other mental illness might be seen this way- -they lose control of which mode they are in , eg , notbeing able to see the difference between the motives people have and the motives they might have . one can then see much of the philosophizing people do as operating in these decoupled modes but failing to be able to keep in front of them the differences from the normal mode. normal mode- -eg , what is that lion doing- - was undoubtedly the first one evolved and decoupled modes- -what did that lion do last time or what does he intend to do next- -evolved later. this was probably never a problem for animals- -any animal that spent too much time worrying about what might happen would not be very successful contributing to the gene pool. it is interesting to speculate that only when humans developed culture and began degeneratinggenetically , could large numbers of people survive with genes that led them to spend alot of time in decoupled modes. hence , we have philosophy and this book , which is mostly about running the decision templates in decoupled mode where there are no real consequencesexcept earning royalties for putting the results in a book for other people to use to run their engines in decoupled mode . ' let us alter wittgenstein 's quote to read : ' 'as longas there continues to be a verb ' to decide'  that looks as if it functions in the same way as ' to eat ' and ' to drink ' , as long as we continueto talk of freedom of action , of saying i wish i had done otherwise , etc. , etc. , people will keepstumbling over the samepuzzling difficulties andfind themselves staring atsomethingwhich no explanation seems capable of clearing up. ' ' as withmost philosophy books , nearly every page ,  often every paragraph , changes from one type of language game to another without noticing that now one would have to be joking or dreaming or acting in a play or reciting a story , etc , and not actually intending anything nor describing an actual situation in the world. on page 10 he says we count on free will for the whole way of thinking about our lives , like we count on food and water , but who ever , outside philosophy , standing in front of lunch counter full of food , ever thinks how fine it is that they have free will so they can pick coke instead of mineral water ?  even if i want to be a serious compatibilist and try thinking this in decoupled mode , i have to exit and enter nondecoupled mode to make the actual choice. only then can i go back to decoupled mode to wonder what might have happened if i had not had the ability to make a real choice. wittgenstein noted how pretend games are parasitic on real ones ( this is not a trivial observation ! ) . the ability to engage in very complex decoupled scenarios is already evident in 4 year old children. so i would say that normally , nobody counts on having choice ,  but rather we just choose. on the same page he shows again that he does not grasp cognitive basics. he says we learn to conduct our lives in the conceptual atmosphere of choice ,  and that ` ' it appears to be a stable and ahistorical construct , as eternal and unchanging as arithmetic , but it is not . ' ' and on page 13- - ''it is an evolved creation of human activity and beliefs'' . the whole thrust of cognitive psychology is that we do not learn the basics of planning , deciding , promising ,  resenting ,  etc , but that these are built-in functions of the inference engines that work automatically and unconsciously and start running in very early childhood. there is no evidence that they change as we grow , or are in any way subject to our beliefs , only that they mature just as our body does. on pg 14 he suggests its probable that our having free will depends on our believing we have it ! do we believe we see an apple , feel a pain , are happy ?  the language game of belief is very different from that of knowing. we can believe we have a dollar in our pocket but if we take it out and look at it we ca n't meaningfully then say that we still believe it ( except as a joke etc. ) . the inference engine can run in decoupled ( belief )  mode so we can imagine havingchoices or making them , but in life we just make them and it is only in very odd situations we can say that we believe we made a choice. but dennett is saying thisis the universal case. if making a choice had any dependence on belief than so would everything everything else- -consciousness ,  seeing , thinking , etc. if we take this seriously ( and he says ' the serious problems of free will ' ) then we are getting into trouble and if we actually try to apply it to life , then madness is minutes away . . on page 65 et seq . , he discusses causation , intention and the ` informal predicates ' that we use to describe atoms etc , but cognitive resarch has shown that we describe all objects with a limited number of ontological categories which we analyse with our intuitive physics modules and that when agents ( ie animals or people or things like them- -ie , ghosts or gods ) are involved we use our concepts ( engines ) for agency , intuitive psychology , social minds , etc to decide how to behave. there is almost certainly no causation module but rather it will involve all of these and other inference engines , depending on the precise situation . discussing possibility and necessity is much easier if one talks in terms of the output of our modules for intuitive physics ,  agency , ontological categories etc. of course there is no mention here of wittgenstein 's many incisive comments on causation , intention , deciding , nor of searle 's now classic works on intention and social reality . he spends much time on ainslie 's book ' breakdown of will ' , in which is discussed the hyperbolic discounting faculties ( ie , inference engines ) by which we evaluate probable outcomes . hemakes much of the excellent work of robert frank on altruism , emotion and economics , but the book he cites was 15 years old when this book was published . it was bingham 's idea , amplified by frank and by boyd and richardson ( 1992 ) that cooperation was greatly stimulated by the evolution of means for punishing cheaters. he suggests these as examples of darwinian approaches that areobligatory and promising. indeed they are , and in fact they are standard parts of economic , evolutionary and cognitive theory , but unfortunately ,  he makes little reference to the other work in these fields . all that work tends to show that people do not choose but their brains choose for them . he does not establish any convincing connection between this work and the general problem of choice. onpg 216 he says that making oneself so that one could not have done otherwise is a key innovation in the evolutionary ascent to free will , and that we can only be free if we learn how to render ourselves insensitive to opportunities . but where this ability resides is not revealed for several chapters !  dennett has a penchant for hiding his ideas in a massive amount of rather irrelevant text. again , he gets things backwards , as there is a vast body of very good evidence from biology and psychology that we are get the feelings that we should behave in some way from our inference engines and these are not provided by some part of our conscious self , but by the automatic and unconscious operation of the engines. as he notes , hundreds of experiments with the prisoner 's dilemma and related protocols have shown how easy it is to manipulate people 's choices and that their calculations are not conscious and deliberate at all. when the situation is manipulated to make them conscious , they are much slower and less reliable . so , there has been constant pressure of natural selection to make the engines fast and automatic and inacessible to deliberate thought . dennett says ` we make ourselves ' so that we could not do otherwise and that this is the basis of morality and choice. the evidence would seem to be exactly the opposite. our inference engines give us basic moral intuitions and we generally act in accord with the results. if we or others do not we feel guilt , outrage , resentment etc ,  then cheater genes will invade the population and this is one of the main theories as to how a good part of morality evolved.our genes make us so we ca n't ( mostly ) do otherwise , not our will or whatever dennett thinks can do it . we can often choose to do otherwise but our own intuitions and the knowledge of social disapproval usually serve to limit our choices. these intuitions evolved in small groups between 50 , 000 and some millions of years ago. in the modern world the intuitions are often not to our advantage and the social controls weak. this is a prime reasonfor the chaos in the world . on pg 225 he finally sneaks in a definition of free will as ' 'a complicated snarl of mechanistic causes that look likedecision making ( from certain angles ) ' ' . he claims that thisplays all the valuable roles of free will but lacks some ( unspecified )  properties possessed by traditional free will. the smoke is thick but i am pretty sure one of those unspecified properties is what we understand aschoice. he insists ( top pg 226 ) that his naturalistic account of decision making leaves plenty of room for moral responsibility , but making ourselves so we could n't do otherwise does not seem to describe the way we actually function ,  nor does it seem to leave any room for morality , as that would seem to consist precisely in being able to do otherwise . he does not propose any test for deciding if a choice is voluntary or forced and i doubt he could do so. normally if someone asks us to move our hand , we know what counts as having a choice ,  but , typical of philosophers ,  i expect that regardless of whether it moves or not he will count both as evidence for his position . at this point he also starts his discussion of libet 's well known work on conscious attention which is the only part of the book that i felt was worth my time . on page 253 et seq . , he sneaks in his definition of conscious will- -the ' 'brains user illusion of itself'' ' which has as one of its main roles providing ' 'me with the means of interfacing with myself at other times ` ` . and ` ` illusory or not , conscious will is the persons guide to his or her own moral responsibility for action . ` `  he says the trick we need is to see that ` ` i ` '  control what is happening inside the ' 'simplification barrier'' ... ' 'where decision making happens'' . ` ` mental events' ' become conscious by ' 'entering into memory'' . ' 'the process of self description... is what we are'' . the crucial thing is that choice is possible because the self is distributed over space ( the brain ) and time ( memories ) . he realizes this is going to leave many incredulous ( everyone who can follow this and really understands ! ) . ' 'i know that many people find it hard to graspthis idea or take it seriously. it seems to them to be a trickwith mirrors ,  some kind of verbal slight of hand that whisksconsciousness , and the real self , out of the picture just when it was about to be introduced . ''  many will say he took the words out of their mouth , but i would say it 's incoherent and thateverythingwe know about consciousness and the whole universe ( making the obvious extensions of such claims ) was gone long beforewegot this far. on pg 259 he says that culture has made us rational animals ! this is a stunning denial of human nature ( ie , genetics and evolution ) coming from the person who wrote ' darwin 's dangerous idea' ' ! presumably he is talking about his idea that it is memories spread over space ( the brain and other people ) and time that give us choices and morals and consciousness ( line 6 from bottom ) . he says consciousness is a user-interface but it is never made clear who or where the user is and how it interfaces with the brain ( you will have to suffer through ' consciousness explained to find that there is no answer there either ) . though he makes many references to evolutionary and cognitive psychology , he seldom uses any of the terminology that has been current for decades ( social mind , intuitive psychology , coalitional intuitions etc ) and clearly is not familiar with most of the concepts . if he means that we got the fine details of morality from culture , thats ok , but this is the icing on the cake and the cake was baked by the genes . we are also told here that r&d ( by which he means evolution here , but other things elsewhere ) has given us the self and that language creates new kind of consciousness and morality . i am sure that he will get little agreement on this . it seems quite clear that consciousness and the basics of morality evolved in primates ( and earlier ) long before spoken language ( though it is a very deep topic as to how language evolved from extant capacities in the brain ) . he continues ` ` morality memes arose by accident some tens of thousands of years ago ` ` which would be ok if he meant the icing on the cake but he clearly means the cake ! and then he says the point of morality is not the survival of our genes , which is an amazing ( and totally incorrect ) thing to say , even if he was only referring to memes . on pg 260 he claims that because we do not comprehend our ' 'bland dispositions to cooperate' ' ,  they mean nothing to us , but it is the operation of our templates that is everything to us. there is ample evidence that if one of them is damaged a person cannot function properly as a social being ( eg , autism ) . i would say it is the operation of the templates for intuitive psychology etc which lead dennett to the counterintuitive views that we do not have consciousness and choice in the way we think . he also says here that it was one of the major evolutionary transitions when we were able to change our views and reflect on reasons for them . this again reflects his lack of understanding of evolutionary psychology . i know of no evidence that the basic moral intuitions , like all the templates , are accessible to consciousness . we may decide our cheating was justifiable , or forgive someone else 's cheating , but we still know it was cheating ( ie , we cannot change the engine ) . i suspect my ancestors a million years ago had the same feelings in the same situation but what has happened is that there are lots of other things that may be taken as relevant and that sometimes these will lead me to act contrary to my feelings . another issue is that as culture developed , one had to make many important or ' moral type ` decisions for which the engines were not evolved to give a clear answer . on pg 267 he says that we now replace our ` free floating rationales ' ( probably corresponding to what cognitive psychologists call our templates or inference engines ) with reflection and mutual persuasion . and on pg 286 he says that it is a child 's upbringing - -demanding and giving reasons- - that affects moral reasoning . again , he just has no grasp of what has happened in the last 30 years of research- -the templates do not change with reflection or upbringing . we are then told again that consciousness makes moral issues available over time to the self , which takes responsibility . it is not any more coherent or credible with repetition . on pg 289 he has a chapter summary which repeats the mistaken notions that it is culture that makes it possible to reflect and that choice depends on education ( memory ) and sharing . it 's clear that it is not culture but the inherited cognitive structures that make it possible to reflect and to choose and that culture determines the acceptable actions and their rewards or punishments . on pg 303 he discusses the classic philosophical barrier between ' ought'and ' is ' , unaware that our templates solved that problem long ago- -ie , they tell us how to feel about situations regarding other people . he also seems to be unaware that there are hundreds of cultural universals implanted in our genes ( eg see ' the blank slate ' ) . he often starts into what looks like its going to be a good discussion of some issue in evolutionary psychology , but invariably wanders off into philosophical arcana and winds up with more confusion . this happens on pg 261 where he states that concepts like ' praiseworthy ' were shaped over millennia by culture , while most would say the basis for such concepts is in the genes and each culture only detetermines the details of acceptable reactions to the intuitions its members get from their innate mechanisms . on pg 262 he tries to explain how an ess ( evolutionarily stable strategy ) can produce morality . his idea here is that genetic ` r&d ` produces dim understandings of morals and then culture ( memetics ) produces variations and clarifications . i would say that we all know , and much research has made clear , that we commonly get very clear results from our inference engines and only dimly understand in special cases . culture merely decides what we can do about our feelings . the last part of the book is mostly concerned with moral culpability. he refers to the legal classic by hart and honore , which i started reading 30 years ago since it 's authors were deeply influenced by wittgenstein. dennett tells us that we have control over our own morality and that thinking about morality will improve us. but , there seems no justification whatever for this view in this book . there is nothing at all here to help anyone escape from the dictates of the monkey mind. it is a defensible point of view that those who manage this do so by traveling a spiritual path that has no connection with philosophy - and there is not a hint of spirituality in this entire book- -another telling point considering that many mystics have fascinating things to say about the functioning of the mind. i find more wisdom about how to be free and moral in any of osho 's 200 books than anywhere in philosophy . one rarely finds spiritually and morally advanced people teaching at universities. there is no sign here , nor in anything he has done , that dennett is morally superior. after 40 years of thinking about morality he launches personal attacks on his critics or arrogantly dismisses them . it seems clear that , like all of us , he is trapped in the limits of his inference engines . so , how much opportunity is there to improve our morality ?  it seems clear ( eg , see pinker 's ` the blank slate ` ) that most of our behaviour is genetic and the rest due to unknown factors in our environment , in spite of the vigorous efforts of parents and religions and political parties . on average , maybe 5% of the variation in moral behavior ( variations are the only thing we can study ) is due to our own efforts. the moral choices that matter most today are those affecting the fate of the world. but our moral templates were not evolved to deal with overpopulation and the greenhouse effect . how remarkable it would be if just one of the hundreds of millions of educated people in the world managed to figure out what consiousness or choice or any mental phenomenon really is . and if one did , we would expect them to be a scientist at the cutting edge of research using some exotic fmri equipment and the latest parallel processing neural networked fuzzy logic computer etc. but a philosopher or physicist just sitting there thinking , coming up with the solution to the greatest puzzle there is ! and then writing a whole book about it without checking with the sceptics first . to return to the quote at the beginning- - 'ambition is the death of thought' . indeed- -though clearly wittgenstein was thinking of interesting thoughts
dvd neg 1.txt i expected so much more from this movie , i guess since the cast included two of my favorite actors ( jolie & washington ) and also had the always on point queen latifah as well . i watched with full expectation to absolutely love this movie , but i walked away bitter with shattered expectations . first off i will say that latifah was wonderful here and she proved as the only reason i smiled on occasion during this movie experience . washington and jolie on the other hand were so unbelievable ( especially washington who really strained in this role ) that i was constantly asking myself " do i really like these two ? " and i had to remind myself of movies like ' gia ' and ' training day ' to answer with a resounding " yes ! " the film follows a rookie cop ( jolie ) as she helps a quadriplegic ex-cop lincoln ( washington ) track down a serial killer mimicking the killings detailed in a book called ' the bone collector' . the ending is really annoying since the revelation of the killer , while not who you 'd pinpoint , is not of any significance and so it manages to stir up absolutely no emotion whatsoever . it 's like " oh so he / she did it...interesting " ...and i 'm bored . i 'd skip this one for it becomes generic within the first five minutes and stays that way until the credits finish rolling
software neg 298.txt after years of e-filing fees being included with the purchase price , it would have been more forthcoming for turbotax to put a large sticker on the front of their box alerting buyers to the price that they will pay for e-filing each return . i lost the value of my entire state return - and then some - through e-filing fees : $44.95 ( plus tax ) for the program , $16.95 ( plus tax ) for each return e-filed ( i filed two ) and a little bonus fee to the company that handles the [credit card] transaction ( that fee is never quoted in the program and i will have to wait for my credit card statement to find out what that is ) . in addition , anyone who chooses to have the fees deducted from his / her refund has to pay an additional $30. the product does what it says . but , for the cost , and less-than-honest way in which the change occured ( it almost seemed deceitful - hence the single star rating ) , i would have preferred to have given my money to my friendly neighborhood accountant . people expect change , even if they do n't like it . but , suprises that cost customers money are never welcome and drive customers away . surely the marketing / advertising gurus can think of a way to alert the customer of a significant change such as this and even put a " positive " spin on it . " filing fees only $16.95 [per return] - less than the cost of a tax professional . . . " no more turbotax for me

dvd pos 202.txt this dvd does not claim to contain a debate about the origins of christianity ; it discusses an alternate viewpoint ( as dan brown reminds us " the winners write the history books " ) this dvd is a nice antidote to all the oppressive ideas we have been raised with ; esp . the idea of god as male , and the idea of women being unworthy of church leadership . this dvd includes interviews with dan burstein , henry lincoln , martin lunn , lynn picknett , clive prince , dr. karen ralls , dr. james robinson , and margaret starbird . i particularly liked margaret starbird 's interviews - she describes how when she first read " holy blood , holy grail " , she found it blasphemous because she had been raised a loyal catholic . but afterward , she had religious experiences regarding the content of that book which lead her to research mary magdalene and write " the woman with the alabaster jar " . she comes across as very rational , sensible and even heroic . it takes courage to contradict the dearly held beliefs of the majority . i thought dan burstein also made some very good points with his discussions about the lives and customs of jewish people during the time jesus lived . i think this dvd is an important reminder that just because you have been taught something all your life - that does n't mean it is necessarily the truth . to be truly alive is to continue to search for the truth as long as you live

music pos 27.txt this outstanding effort by prince consists of mostly spare jazzy r&b tunes , driven by incredibly loose , free-flowing live instrumentation . i could only begin to tell you about the stylistic variety on this album . with the three disc format there is a lot to absorb , and the third disc really can largely be done without , but the first two truly do rank amongst his best work . it should also be noted how especially romantic prince is on this album . this album was made around the time that he entered into his first marriage , and it shows because this c.d. is overflowing with outstanding romantic ballads . most of his albums only contain one or two ballads , so if you 've been longing for an album that includes more , then this album should really appeal to you . this c.d. does not fit into the " standard " prince " mold " ( i know that it is perhaps a bit oxymoronic to speak of a " prince mold " but his personal signature is not quite as bold on this album as it is on many of his other works , even those that are admittedly not as good ) . the reason for this is that prince follows rather than leads on a good portion of this album . the fact that there are two covers on the first disc alone shows that prince was in the mood to do what was being done instead of doing something new ( he covers songs by bonnie raitt and the stylistics ) which is unsual for this constant innovator , but this album is so great because he is so skillful that he does it better than almost anyone else . one minor problem that i notice is that it seems that on a few songs particularly on the first disc , prince just does n't pay much attention to the lyrics . there are too many generic r&b come-ons and cheesy cliche 90 's catch phrases such as " gettin ' your groove on ' , and prince is much too clever , witty , and creative to resort to such things . but , really that is just a minor quibble because the music truly is consistently outstanding throughout the first two discs . and then , he has songs such as " soul sanctuary " and " let 's have a baby " which are two of the most well-written ballads that i 've heard from him . " in this bed i scream " is just magnificent both lyrically and musically . he takes the lead again on this track and he does it in a major way . this clever , poetic , and romantic track has an infectiously catchy both rhythm and melody that would easily pack any dance floor . other highly impressive moments include the high powered funk of " we gets up " , the absolutely brilliant and stunning arrangement on " curious child " , and the sincere , pure passion of the just so perfect r&b / gospel blend of " savior " . " joint 2 joint " is impressive just for having so much variety in terms of sounds and elements , with each part so effectively enhancing a different part of the story . the first two discs are really solid overall . the third disc however finds prince trying his hand at techno and other forms of conventional dance / club music , and the results are not very impressive . but , i do n't see how they could be , even coming from prince . techno for the most part is insanely repetitive , monotonous , and downright drone-like . there are only three songs on disc three that were really worth it ( slave , my computer , and the title track ) . well , maybe four , his cover of " la la ( means i love you ) " is actually really good too . those songs could have been put on the first two discs and the 3rd disc really could have been omitted . the most impressive feat that he manages to accomplish on this entire album is making a great chorus and a great song out of the line " www ' dot ' emale ` dot ' com " on " emale " : - ) . i was unaware of this feat for a while because i used to always skip this song because it started off with that really annoying 90 's g-funk whistle . so overall , this album really does rank amongst prince 's best work , and it should especially appeal to those who would like to see him do more ballads and dive into more r&b

dvd neg 747.txt this might be the perfect flick for a fourteen year-old who aspires to be a mass murderer . there is little to recommend it apart from the technical perfection of some of the cinematography and the staging of the scenes of mass destruction of people and property . even these scenes have none of the balletic grace of tarantino 's " kill bill " films , his salute to the genre , or " reservoir dogs , " which has a mystery at its core and some fine acting and dialogue that temper the violence . " bullet ...

health neg 311.txt unfortunately , my experience was completely different . starting with the unprofessional shipping . shaver and components were shipped in a box stuffed with old newspapers instead of professional packing material . shaver and trimmer are almost exactly lifesize in the screenshot on this page ! ! i felt mislead by the pictures . another person said how impressive the shaver is . i had the exact opposite experience . i picked it up and i was more than underwhelmed . the shaver is about the size of a saltshaker and the battery accounts for the weight , not the motor . not to be mean , but the shaver reminds me of something i might pickup in a 99 cents store . the other day i found a far better shaver from remington for about $8 in my local raley 's store . of course , to find out about this seiko shaver first hand you 'll need to open the shrink wrap which then in turns makes it almost moot to return the item , because donner charges a 35% sanitary disposal fee if you open the item . on top of that the shipping charges are also non-refundable . on the other hand , if i return the $8 grocery store shaver to the store , i 'd get a full refund , if i 'm not happy with the product . ok , so how well does it shave ? not bad , but also not any better than the $8 shaver from my grocery store . the blade component seems extremely flimsy ( essentially 3 tiny blades stuck to a piece of plastic ) and if you do decide to use this shaver , you 'll be ordering replacement blades in no time . all in all , i was not happy with my purchase in the least . $60 spent on something that should be around $10

music pos 331.txt it would be easy to say that this is the single greatest performance of the mahler eighth ever recorded ; i believe it is . but it would be difficult to say that and have it mean something , because after experiencing this colossal achievement , the competition ( including , alphabetically , abbado , bernstein , chailly , haitink , horenstein , kubelik , nagano , olson [colorado mahlerfest] , solti , and tennstedt , among others ) suddenly seemed far less impressive than they once had . what sets this mahler eighth so far apart from virtually every other is its sense of ecstasy ; of a transcendent vision being communicated , of a religious fervor . mahler had an extraordinary plan in putting together what he considered his most important work , such that he could bring us to the brink and say , " there . it 's out there . you ca n't see it , but you can divine it " ( and call " it " what you will : " god " or " love " or some all-embracing power outside of ourselves ) . most performances miss the mark , then , in one of two ways : by remaining resolutely earthbound or by trying to capture that vision in terms we can understand . the problem , of course , is that if we can understand it , it 's no longer a vision , it 's something mundane . in the closing pages of wit 's extraordinary ( and that word , as well as any other , hardly begins to do it justice ) performance you become aware of that vision existing just beyond your comprehension . you know it 's there only because you 're willing to take that leap of faith . and that 's what i mean when i say he brings the piece a sense of religious fervor . there is nothing dogmatic about the kind of religion i 'm referring to here . so let 's look at the basic components of the performance , element by element : the sound : spectacularly natural and all-encompassing . the soloists emerge from the overall sonic image like members of the orchestra , and the chorus , orchestra , and organ blend to perfection . the soloists : to a letter the finest group i have ever heard . there 's a distinctly slavic sound that seems altogether appropriate given mahler 's bohemian roots , and a refreshing lack of self-importance . no operatic grandstanding here . and for the first time ever i felt as though i was missing something by not following the words ( no libretto is provided , though it is available online and can be found easily enough elsewhere ) because everyone sounded like they cared dearly about what they were singing . they were n't going through the motions , making pretty sounds . they had something imperative to communicate and wanted us to know it . to be honest , part ii has often bored me to tears ( with chailly 's performance being particularly offensive in this regard ) but here i was literally on the edge of my seat throughout , impatient to hear what ( and who ) came next . and throughout it all , so importantly , there was a sense of spiritual ascent from beginning to end . the choruses : easily the best i 've ever heard . the way they rip into " hostem repellas longius " with their shrieks in the great double fugue of part i is unforgettable , and the fugue itself , which has never reminded me more of the " rabble " section from the first movement of mahler 's third , literally had my spine tingling throughout its entire course . that 's nothing . i got chills right at the beginning of the chorus mysticus and six and a half minutes later they had not abated ! i have never experienced anything like that before . ever . and i do n't just mean while listening to music . the conductor : what can i say ? he holds the symphony together with a tautness and logic that nobody ever credited this work with having before . how ? i have no idea , but when the start of part ii does n't jar , as it usually does , you know you 're in for something special . maybe it 's because the orchestral prelude there seems faster than usual , or because he finds so much inwardness in the first part ( the first entry of the soloists , for instance , is so raptly caressing ) . the orchestra : while they do n't have the " mahler sound " that the concertgebouw or vienna philharmonic may produce , there 's an earthiness ( but never sloppiness ) that sets them far apart from the bleached , sterile sound of too many american orchestras that make mahler sound not like mahler . to sum up , then , i could not speak for an hour after hearing this recording , and still burst into tears at the mere thought of it , especially those radiant , visionary , and extraordinary closing pages . record of the year ; record of the century ! it crowns not merely my mahler collection but an entire lifetime of listening to great music .

camera pos 106.txt i bought this camera for the same reason many of you are considering it , or have already bought it- -it 's size . it is amazingly small , it 's hard to believe all that has been packed into this camera . i take it with me everywhere , literally , it is so small that i am able to keep it in my pocket , and i do n't have to fear that it will get ruined in my pocket because it is so durable . there is also a small covering for the lens , so you need not worry that the lens will get scratched . the picture quality surprised me , when i first saw this camera i saw how small it was an instantly assumed that the picture quality would not be good- -but i was wrong ! the picture quality of this camera is outstanding ( taking its ' size and price into consideration ) . however , i do have a few things to complain about.. . first off , the battery . this camera uses a lithium battery , i find lithium batteries to be highly inconvenient ; because what if you are on vacation , where the nearest place to buy batteries is just a gas station- -there is no way that you are going to find lithium batteries there . not only is it inconvenient , but also the battery life span is short . the longest i 've had it work was about 1 hour and 45 minutes . this is n't uncommon in cameras , though , just as long as you bring your charger and spare batteries , you should be fine . another problem i had with this camera was the zoom function . such a small zoom length that you would think that the zoom would be silent since it hardly zooms in...wrong ! very wrong . the zoom function on this camera is so loud that sometimes you will be unable to use it if you find yourself in a situation where you must be quiet . even just turning the camera on will move the lens a little , resulting in a noisy start-up . the flash is very weak . really dissapointing . if you are inside , you ca n't be any farther away then 10 feet in a lit room . the last problem i found with this camera was the macro function . the auto-focus on the camera seems to have trouble focusing on the subject . to make matters work , there is no manual override to overcome this problem . the focus is great , though , if you are not taking a macro shot . these are all the flaws i found in the camera , it 's not my first choice in cameras , i have come across many other beginner cameras that i prefer over this camera , but the thing you have to keep in mind about this camera is the size . if you are just looking for something to keep with you at all times , then this is a great camera choice .

music pos 81.txt before i review this classic rolling stones album , i just want to point out that juke box hero and whirligig are one in the same person . a troll who likes to trash great music and praise dire straits ( who are a good band but nit the greatest ) and green day . i say cut the shenanigans ! now that is off my chest , back to the review ! the rolling stones ' second album to be released on their own label fittingly called rolling stones records , which was distributed by atlantic at the time ( now virgin / capitol ) , entitled exile on main street was released in may of 1972. the album was the band 's only double studio album but is one of rock 's greatest double studio albums in history and ranks up there with other classic 2-record sets like the wall , quadrophenia , the lamb lies down on broadway and tommy among others . before guitarist keith richards ' heroin addiction took over for some time in the mid-1970s , he was what the late producer jimmy miller called a workhorse . the album was recorded at keith 's home in france and at olympic studios in london and muscle shoals in alabama and in los angeles . keith 's music and frontman mick jagger 's lyric writing was arguably at its peak on exile on main street . songs like the opening rocker rocks off , the 50s sounding rocker rip this joint , the album 's hit tumbling dice , the country-ish sweet virginia , keith 's classic rocker happy ( and it is his most famous track which he sang ) , the slow-ish soul survivor , the fast-paced blues rocker all down the line and the soul sounding shine a light are classics which sound like they could have been recorded yesterday . ventilator blues was another highlight as it was the only song that mick and keith wrote was co-written by guitarist mick taylor whom just tore the place up from 1969-74 ( his solos just rocked from 1969-74 ) . exile on main street was the rolling stones ' second consecutive #1 album and another million seller . the tour in support of the album saw the band getting bigger and bigger . almost 35 years on , this album is still a classic ! this album is hugely recommended

dvd pos 132.txt despite the chintzy , unconvincing facial hair ( jeff daniels ' being the exception ) ; martin sheen 's too-gentlemanly interpretation of gen . lee 's accent ( and his beard ) ; obvious & saccharine soliloquies about the higher purpose for fighting the war ; generalized ( and largely inaccurate ) interpretations of the underlying history of the war ; and hopelessly , ridiculously , wildly off-the-mark attempts atnew england accents , the film still works . i understand that to get a film produced and distributed , it is often necessary to have recognizable names in the cast . but an unknown who looks more like general lee than martin sheen would have been a better choice . and c . thomas howell 's performance- -well , let 's just say that his glued-on beard was more convincing than his acting . jeff daniels , however , does an excellent job , in large part because he does n't try to convince you he 's from new england and consequently does not come off like cliff from cheers , using every stereotype associated with nasal ' r' -dropping . instead of focusing on the so-called nasality of the ne accent ( think of sheen in the missiles of octobah ) , daniels allows the viewer to suspend disbelief . but then , here comes ct howell again to slap you across the face and remind you that sheen and kevin costner are n't the only actors who should have appeared as new englanders in an ed wood production . i think the story works because there 's enough commitment to historical military fact to make it believable . the battle scenes probably should have been more visually graphic to evoke the horror of the battle , but the movie makers either did n't have the budget for gore ( maybe it was spent on the obviously fake beards ) or decided to err on the side of forbearance . if gettysburg had been made 8-10 years later , it might have benefited from the newer style of violence-depiction , as in saving private ryan , thin red line , or gladiator . it falls a bit short of that , however . finally , it should be noted that the producers / director seem to be operating on a rather simplistic view of the war 's historical underpinnings , opting to represent the northern point of view as one united behind the idea of freeing the slaves . anyone who knows about the boston busing riots of the 1970s will understand that not all of the north is steeped in racial generosity and brotherhood . very few who fought on the side of the blue fought because they believed in the abolition of slavery . they fought to preserve the union , which is a very different concept . abolition of slavery happened to be the issue that forced the south 's hand , but it was not the sole cause of the war . the movie dumbs this down a bit , making the message more like what you 'd find in a 5th-grade text book . the battle at gettysburg was certainly pivotal , but viewers should remember that it did not end the civil war . the north absolutely needed to win it , but lee continued to cause the north fits for almost 2 years after gettysburg . c . thomas howell will continue to cause me fits every time i think of this movie . still and all , the film is very watchable . and due credit should be given to the re-enactors , arguably the greatest source of credibility for the film

dvd pos 286.txt this film is a landmark in blending science and advocacy . it seeks to assert that animals lead complex and sophisticated emotional lives , not unlike our own . but it manages to walk the fine line between subjectivity and objectivity . it avoids going too far into the subjective . it does n't try to emotionally blackmail the viewer with mere cute / stagey displays of animal interaction . instead it relies heavily on scientific observation in both natural and controlled environments . but by the sheer genious of editing and writing , one cannot help but be drawn into the lives of these noble creatures just as one would a good drama . the movie wisely lets the animals ' behavior " do the talking " , and does n't try to push the viewers ' judgement one way or the other . it left me rethinking everything i had assumed about animals , emotions , and the nature of our ( and by ' our ' i mean all of god 's creatures ) existence

software pos 608.txt what i like about this software is that it does not come with too many " gadgets . " at my age , i am " technically challenged . " so this software worked out fine for me with my limited computer skills . i also like the fact that this software covers castilian spanish . it is probably the only course available that exclusively covers castilian spanish in such depth since pimsleur and learning like crazy only offer latin american spanish courses . the downside of this software is that you will not learn much spanish grammar with it . if you want to learn the rules and mechanisms required to combine words and form sentences in spanish , you will have to buy a good spanish grammar book . for that i strongly recommend spanish grammar for independent learners by avigail azoulay , arie vicente . it is more expensive than other spanish grammar books but it is well worth the money .

dvd pos 268.txt if you follow my reviews , you know that i felt the version of " jack the ripper " with michael caine as inspector fred abberline was a phenomenal masterpiece . not only was michael caine phenomenal in the role , but that version offered convincing speculation to a mystery we do n't know and never will . while i respect this version with johnny depp , it is more horror oriented . ( michael caine 's version was more historical . ) onto the subject at hand . some of you may know jack 's 5 victims . ( mary anne nichols , annie chapman , elizabeth stride , kathy eadows , and mary jane kelly . ) well , they seem to have a close friendship , and we also get the impression that they share some dangerous secret . ( in the michael caine version , the 5 victims knew each other , but they were just associates . ) well , of course jack the ripper comes into play . one scene is very well done in that while we do n't see his face , we do see some disturbing pictures , and we do see him cutting his steak and pouring blood red wine . in comes depp ( inspector fred abberline ) . it is interesting that while the older michael caine brought frustration and tremendous energy to the role , johnny depp looks like his character is living on borrowed time and going to die anyday . but maybe depp did n't want to just imitate caine . one thing i had a problem with was that while caine had some trouble with his superiors , depp 's trouble with his superiors is blown out of proportion . ( without giving the story away , his superiors must have known things that they did n't tell depp ! at least caine 's superiors carried some reason on their side ! ) you 'll probably notice that depp finds things out much quicker than caine did . ( probably because caine 's version was 4 hours , while depp 's is only 2. ) while caine was involved with an artist , depp becomes involved with mary jane kelly . gradually , depp discovers things that put together an interesting puzzle . like caine did in his version , depp ironically gets close and almost friendly with the killer . ( of course , depp does not know he is talking to the killer . ) well , another problem here is that in the caine version , we can understand more why the killer appeared normal and was even friendly with caine . we never really understand here why the killer is friendly and even helpful to depp . ( jack the ripper does not have the same mental illness he did in the caine version . ) i will admit that the scenery is well done , the elements of horror are there , and depp did a good job of not just imitating michael caine . and depp 's sergeant godley does offer some entertainment . but if you saw the michael caine version , you will undoubtedly miss the quite probable historical accuracy . if on the other hand , you do n't mind the fact that this version is more geared towards horror than history , you 'll probably find it a respectable horror movie . side note : johnny depp makes inspector fred abberline look like he 's going to die anyday . well , in reality , fred abberline lived on for 40 more years after he stopped jack the ripper .
software neg 1.txt the easy language 16 is only useful if you 're already familiar with the language you wish to learn . i 've been studying french for months before buying this product and found it to be helpful when i 'm getting rusty . the only problem is that it 's hard to make out what is being said because the sound is not clear . the recorded speakers also do n't bother to slow down to give you a chance to understand or repeat what is being said . this is good cause it 's like listening to an actual french speaker and not a robot , bad if you actually want to learn how to pronounce what is being said . it will also go over basic french grammar but is totally useless if you do n't already know basic french grammar . i also tried to use this to learn japanese . unlike french , i 'm not familiar with the japanese language at all so trying to use this product to learn it became a nightmare . if all you want to do is learn how to speak the language it does have a romanized version of the words and phrases to make it easier to sound them out . unfortunately the basic japanese grammar and japanese alphabet are all written in japanese . for instance , in the grammar section it has the past , present and future " i am " it 's written in english then beside it it 's written in japanese . you ca n't click them to have it sound out for you . in the japanese alphabet section all it has is the japanese alphabet and you can click them to sound them out but you really have no clue what you are sounding out . so it teaches you nothing about reading the language but the test they want you to take are purely in japanese . i do want to learn how to read , write and speak japanese so none of this would be a problem if it actually taught you how to read , write , and speak japanese ! so my guess would be that you really have to be familiar with japanese ( not the romanized ( romanjj ) version ) already in order to use this product . because of my experiences with this product i would say get it only if you know the languages you 're interested in and use it as a refresher and nothing more . since i am familiar with french this product was pretty helpful but if i used this as a starter for the language i probably would have quit . i 'm searching amazon for better japanese books . so if you want to actually learn a language look to the books with the language tapes and cd 's

books neg 863.txt as a complete newbie to xml this was a good starter . as i got deeper into xml i found several mistakes / deficiencies in the book , and sometimes the author just flat out seemed to not know what he was talking about . for instance , the claim on page 86 that ( #cdata ) is a valid dtd element content definition is flat out wrong . his description of schema element declarations ( pp . 114-115 ) teaches that using globals / refs is the only way to define complex elements , and is inappropriate for his example . he makes no mention of globals at all , leaving the reader confused . i have ceased to trust this book as a valid source of xml information
music neg 185.txt i live in buffalo and i 'm a big prog rock fan ; so when i saw this cd at the library , i knew i had to give it a free listen . but make no mistake - this cd under-delivers on many levels . i always wanted asia to be a great band - it had my favorite guitar player ( steve howe ) , a top-shelf drummer ( carl palmer ) , and a proven bass player / vocalist who was up to the task ( john wetton ) . but there was always a bit too much " pop " , simplicity and repetition in their music to totally engage me . hey , progressive rock is mostly about " different " , complexity and change , right ? asia was a progressive-pop band ( akin to the later albums of todd rundgren 's utopia ) that made good music , but did n't really pioneer much of anything . same with this cd . there 's little here that 's new or better than the studio versions of the songs . palmer 's long drum solo got boring after a while . steve 's acoustic solos can be found on other yes recordings , and done much better there - here , the recording quality is so bad that it sounds like he 's playing tuned rubber bands at times . ( honestly , i remember hearing better fidelity from my old kenner close'n'play ! ) o.k. , it was cool to hear steve express his pleasure at playing in buffalo again ! but the so-called " keyboard solo " by geoff downs was underwhelming to say the least , and reinforced my suspicion that he was sort of the weak link in this group of otherwise great prog virtuosos . i guess if one loves a band too much , they can blindly overlook some shortcomings on almost any cd by that band , and that 's just fine for those people . however , the objective reality of this cd 's value comes creeping in on many other 's existing reviews : namely , the production quality is sub-par ( to the point of being annoying at times ) ; the vocals and harmonies are often off-key ( you really should n't have to wince this much during 79 minutes of music ! ) ; this is clearly a single disk album that was issued on 2 disks for some reason ; the packaging and liner notes are scant ; and the performance just does n't add much to the studio versions . this is for asia completists only . asia did make a solid 5-star progressive-pop cd with their first studio album . i love it . but they never improved upon it , and never stretched out into new territory . perhaps this 1982 live recording exposes some of the weaknesses that kept this potential supergroup from going from " good " to " great " . support your local library . ( and in this case , save some cash ! )

books neg 333.txt thriller and mystery readers like to guess along with our protagonists when we 're reading a story . we like to look for clues in what we 've read to help us unravel the plot , and find out who did it and why the crime was done . john grisham cheats us out of that fun . the villian of this book is n't introduced until there less than 75 pages left , which means that when you get that far , you realize that everything you read before then was n't valid . to have some red herrings in a thriller is fine , but to have 300 pages of chases and red herrings ? that 's bad . read another thriller instead of this one , one that plays by the rules
dvd pos 58.txt following the series of firefly , serenity continues the story line for a few more steps . there are so many ways this movie is packed i cannot begin to properly mention them here . the storyline is woven to present images not so much out of sequence but in a " solving the mystery " approach . the english language used presents a plausible development that on first viewing is not difficult to follow or understand - mostly through common word usage that is more and more endearing with subsequent viewing . the animations are first rate and contribute to an unbelievably real quality . the characters are complex , focused , solid and believable from the way they are unchanging in their demeanor in all situations . the challenges the crew of serenity face are many : from their interactions with unsavory underworld bosses while earning money for survival to avoiding authority " alliance " forces to the overt mortal threat of the " reavers " . the climax builds to the end revealing some things while setting the stage for the story to continue . the music in serenity contributes to the experience leaving me wanting more . i suggest seeing the series firefly before watching the movie serenity to fully understand and grasp the nuances of the characters

camera pos 617.txt this is a very good camcorder with the main problem i noted being the dvd format giving only 30 minutes or so of recording in hd mode per disk . it is also a problem that only blue-ray dvd players can play back the dvd in hd mode . even worse that it might destroy the disk if you use it on another player . nevertheless , the price was good and i think blue-ray will be more affordable in the near future . meanwhile , i can playback my video directly or send it to the computer . i am glad i bought it . if a minidv tape version were available at the same price now i think it might be better to stick with the tape version for now though . i was sent a bad power supply with the camcorder but sony sent a new one right away . be careful to buy the correct battery and external charger accessories for the camera as it is a bit confusing as to which will work for it . overall - i am very happy with the camcorder

music pos 488.txt " burnin ' " was the last album by the wailers as a collective group , afterwhich peter tosh and bunny wailer left the group to pursue solo careers and marley reformed his group , calling it " bob marley & the wailers " in 1974. the album shows the original three at their best , balancing lead vocals on several songs between bob marley , bunny wailer , and peter tosh . the album not only serves to further reveal bob 's soon-to-be legendary work , but also to show the talent of bunny wailer with his lead vocals on songs like " hallelujah time " and " pass it on " . the album also shows tosh taking lead with marley on " one foundation " and alongside marley on " get up , stand up " . the album 's biggest gem , however , was " i shot the sheriff , " soon to be made a favorite in the u.s. and the u.k. by rock artist eric clapton on his 1974 " 451 ocean boulevard " album . the deluxe edition also features a concert from the tour in leeds , u.k. just one week before the wailers broke up . ( bunny , however , was already absent , having refused to tour outside of jamaica once and for all earlier that year . his temporary replacement , the wailers ' old vocal coach , joe higgs was also absent , quitting the tour after they completed their shows in the u.s. ) 1973 's " burnin ' " shows the original wailers at their very best before their breakup and is a timeless classic for music fans everywhere , i can guarentee it

camera pos 350.txt this uv filter does it job to protect the lens well . the build is solid ( metal construction ) . the glass is also descent quality . about the performance , it absorbs some uv light . the uv light absorbtion is hardly noticeable , probably the sky 1-a and the haze filter version will absorb more uv light than this lens which is fine for me . now , about the one problem which is the internal reflection . i 've heard many people say that it mostly happens during night or low light shooting . i found out that it is not caused directly by the low light / night situation . the internal reflection will appear when there is a strong / bright source of light in comparison to the overall exposure ( the surrounding environment ) . to put it in example ( which hopefully is easier to understand ) , when you take a picture of a lamp during nightime and the light is much brighter than the surrounding area then you will see the internal reflection . as you move the position of the light to be closer to the sides / corner of the picture ( and not in the center of the picture ) , the internal reflection reduces and finally dissapear ( if you move the light far enough from the center ) . and if the light is n't too bright / contrast compare to the surrounding environment then there will be no internal reflection . but of course most of the time , a lamp at nightime is often very bright . but the point that i 'm trying to make is that the internal reflection does n't happen all the time during low light or night time . additionally , the internal reflection is n't only happening at night . it can also happen in the afternoon if you are taking a picture of a sun for example . basically same rule as above , on how bright is the light source compared to the surrounding area , and as you move the sun from the center of the photo and near the side the internal reflection will move to the side / dissapear ( also depending the angle ) . but the best way is just to remove the filter during these situations . hope this explanation helps you to reduce the occurence of internal reflection by identifying correctly when the internal reflection will occur and then remove the filter during those situation ( which is not hard to do ) . i 'm actually not a fan of lens filter ( any filter ) as i think it will only degrade picture quality as we added another layer between the sensor and object , but i decided to use them anyway for all my lens . and i would recommend everyone to get one of this filter if you do n't have any filter for your lens yet . i use this filter on my 50mm f / 1.8d lens and on my 18-55mm lens .

books neg 860.txt this is one of the worst-written programming books i have seen yet . i 'm sorry i bought it . it appears to be written by a man who knows quite a bit about finance , and dangerously little about c++ programming . duffy 's review correctly describes the main flaws . i would add that ( 1 ) the book is not structured to build upon oo , gof patterns , or stl design principles ; ( 2 ) the code does not follow even basic c++ coding conventions ; ( 3 ) the images ( screenshots ) are agonizingly unreadable ; ( 4 ) the code listings are in italics using a variable-pitch font [is courier font code listing so difficult to include in a $100 book ? ? ? ] ; ( 5 ) no over-arching component object model is suggested anywhere in the book . some of the efforts at brevity are just plain wrong or even dangerously wrong to teach beginning programmers . for example , pg 19 data types section : - -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - int - holds integer numbers up to a little over 2 million , for example , " int i = 2000000 ; . " long - same as int . - -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - wrong , professor ! this is not only a syntactically incorrect example , but a just plain wrong assertion . if the reader does not know how to determine the ( platform-specific ) size of an " int " or " long " , then the author has only served to confuse the matter further ! furthermore , i consider it a " cheapskate " tactic to ask readers to pay for the code from this book in electronic form ( particularly when the book 's code listings are so sloppy ) . that said , i would not use the code , even if it had been supplied for free ... but it *might* have been interesting to have something to play around with.. . have any of the reviewers actually used any code from this book without substantial refactoring ? the only use i could see for this book is for intermediate-advanced fin-techs , who want to review a few general algorithms for selected derivative calculations ( futures , forwards , etc ) ... but just be prepared to squint and suffer through reading the code

music neg 623.txt get off the drugs , guys . your reviews made me purchase this awful load of tripe . while proficient enough on the instruments and vocals , the moon falls woefully short just about everywhere else . the songs sound very similar to one another and are all pretty much void of any decent melodies or even a good hook or two . right when it seems they might be getting somewhere , they break the rhythm and make a feeble attempt to psych it up or out with a sitar , swirling strings or the ever constant and really abused minor key chord changes . there is also a curious lack of any decent choruses , here . i have to believe that that was a conscious effort on the part of the moon . bad idea , guys . and while the music is pretty lame , the lyrics are absolutely wretched . can anyone out there , after listening to this , remember more than ten words from any song on this washed out cd ? if you can , it 's because they 're so lame and uninspiring . the lyrics from the temptations ' " psychadelic shack " captures the feeling of the sixties better than anything these blotterheads came up with . here 's a big hint about the musical contents of this cd . it actually says on the front cover , " featuring david marks of the beach boys . " huh ? ? ? is that supposed to be a ringing endorsement ? comparing these guys to left banke , the zombies or the beatles is pure blasphemy ! for those of you fortunate enough to not have heard the moon before , count your lucky stars . if you feel yourself slipping to the dark side ( the boneheads giving this 4 or 5 stars ) and feel like spending some extra cash , there are other sixties groups more worthy of your money , like the aforementioned bands . i 'm probably going to piss some people off with this review , but that 's exactly how i felt after giving this cd a listen . honestly , i immediately thought of george harrison 's less than stellar second rate efforts while listening to this . i love ya george , but you put out more than one clinker of a northern song . if bad harrison 's your thing......well , then stop reading and buy this cd now ! for the rest of you , there 's a lot of music from somewhat obscure sixties bands coming out on cd right now . garage or psych , a lot of it is great , but the mine is also getting stipped pretty bare . the moon is proof positive . it 's also pretty easy to see why their recording company called it quits after two albums - and the second album is far superior to the first in both sound and content ! in closing , while this album has overwhelming intracasies layered into the music and vocals , the end product is very bland . i read these guys admitted to cutting these songs while under the influence of lsd . it shows ! i rated this " aural adventure " two stars , instead of one , for two reasons . first , i kept rooting for these guys to come up with a decent song to salvage the album ( actually two ) . they never did , but at least they performed all original songs . it 's also worth an added star to see a rerelease from a sixties band that does n't have a cover of " hey joe " on it . if you 're still with me ( and also a lover of good music or even mediocre fare ) , avoid this cd like the plague ! i 'd also like to thank amazon for putting this clinker on my recommendation lists . you done me wrong

camera pos 943.txt i 've had this digital camera for almost a year . it 's the fourth camera i 've owned . i spent quite some time searching for a compact camera that i could carry everywhere . being an amateur photographer ( and mostly taking pictures for myself and not others ) , i did n't want to lug around an extra bag just for my camera . it fits discreetly in your pocket or a small purse ( for formal nights out ) . the size and weight of this camera is its best feature , and this carries through to the newer generations of this camera , too . this has been the perfect camera for everything from selling items on-line to landscape scenery . my pictures have always turned out beautifully , with wonderful color and crispness . i have discovered that the " automatic " lighting feature is not always the most ideal , but you can re-program just about anything on this camera . it 's really quite a good camera , and given its price these days with the newer generations out there , it 's a steal

books neg 854.txt unfortunately , for all the name brand that this book conveys , i think the cover seems to be the most intriguing part . there are much better ways for book peddling and the fact that a firm such as mckinsey allowed their name on the title of a book for the sake of a few sales , boggles this readers mind . the subject matter seems to be along the lines of the bull session with all bull and no session . no actual quantitative analysis is used throughout the book , and if anything more than an encyclopedic definition is learned from this book , i would be astounded . save some money and go search online for some basic books on beginning valuation . by the way , those giving 5 stars either ca n't read english very well or are shills for mckinsey

books pos 748.txt this was an astounding book about an even more astounding woman , rachel shilsky , a.k.a ruth mcbride jordan . written by one of her 12 children , james , this book is both biography ( mother ) and autobiography ( child ) . a polish jew ( white ) who fled her oppressive surroundings in backwater virginia , ruth met and married two different black men and managed to raise 12 children in some extremely difficult circumstances in harlem , new york . not only did she start a baptist church with her husband , she coped with a regular dose of racism , some significant poverty and still managed to send 12 children to school ( all of whom became professionals , and productive citizens ) . the book is written by the son , but the voice of the mother is registered throughout ( in italic print ) . she evades all queries about her background , her family , in fact any of her history , and it is not until much later that the son uncovers her history ( abusive father , crippled mother ) and the reader is even more impressed with the fortitude and will that it must have taken this woman to make her own life in a community that was not of her economic , racial , or religious experience . although the book is ostensibly about this man 's childhood and his remarkable mother , it is also a fascinating glimpse of racism , religion and social exclusion in the black communities in new york in the 1960s . each of ruth 's children experienced a certain unease about their racially ` different ' mother and yet each became aware of who they were and what they were about . this book is just a marvelous read . full of funny and sad tales of a rather unique family life , mcbride 's work is a tribute to his extraordinary mother .

music neg 104.txt greatest hits collections of rap artists are usually a pretty bad idea . most good rappers pack a visceral punch on first impact , but this wears thin with repeated listenings . this is especially true of gangsta rap . with what allegedly should represent the best work of b-t-h on one disk , this collection falls on its face trying to get around itself . arranged back to back , the rapid-fire syncopated delivery that constitutes virtually every track on this collection wears thin . the raps blur together , and after two songs , the obscenity-laced machine-gun vocal play loses its novelty value , sounding more like a stylized novelty than any type of artistic vision . once the raps lose their ability to hold your attention , all that remains are the rhythm tracks , which are serviceable at best . their biggest hit , " tha crossroads " , appears here in a version that is completely unrecognizable from its better-known form , further reducing the value of this collection . worse , they include a warmed-over version of " f - tha police " , an exercise in futility that only serves to dissipate the power of nwa 's original . spending money on this collection is like buying old newspaper articles . it might have had some value when it first hit the stands , but who wants yesterday 's papers ? c tom rya

music pos 440.txt the best of taste compiles material from their 4 official albums released from 1969-72. the albums consisted of two studio albums & quot ; taste&quot ; , & quot ; on the boards , and the two live albums & quot ; live taste&quot ; , and & quot ; live at the isle of wight&quot ; . this band was a power trio led by rory gallagher before he disbanded the group to embark on a successful solo career . the band led by gallagher on vocals , guitar ( electric , acoustic , & amp ; slide ) , harmonica , and alto sax specialized in hard hitting blues rock . the music has much in common with cream . however , the richard mccracken and john wilson could not compete with the stellar musicianship of jack bruce and ginger baker . the undervalued gallagher is an unsung guitar hero whose work compares favorably with that of eric clapton . like cream the band favored extended versions of tunes like & quot ; sugar mama&quot ; and & quot ; i feel good&quot ; included here . the music included here is varied . it ranges from the slow gut wrenching version of & quot ; catfish&quot ; to the more acoustic cover of & quot ; leavin ' blues&quot ; . the cuts from & quot ; on the boards&quot ; become more jazzy at times . tracks like & quot ; on the boards&quot ; and & quot ; it 's happenened before , it 'll happen again&quot ; highlight the band 's more improvisational approach . hard hitting tracks like & quot ; eat my words&quot ; spotlight gallagher 's outstanding slide technique . two cuts i miss from this period which are not included here are & quot ; dual carriageway pain&quot ; from & quot ; taste , and & quot ; morning sun&quot ; from & quot ; on the boards&quot ; . the live concert favorite & quot ; sinner boy&quot ; provides a bridge to gallagher 's solo career as the studio version was included on his first solo album & quot ; rory gallagher&quot ; . this anthology provides a great overview of the early work of irish blues-rock guitar hero rory gallagher and his battered stratocaster . it is even more essential as the four original albums are only available as imports

books pos 327.txt i dedicate this review to women all around the world of all colour , races , religions , nationality and creed.. . ( all women are equal , in my eyes....nigel. . ) in this remarkable novel , sk makes his debut.an unlikely but good book.it has a good dose of horror / suspense and it is one of the best books i have ever read.. . it is simply about a teenager from maine , named carietta white ( carrie ) .from the beginning of the story we see who her mother ( margaret white ) takes advantage of her , making her feel stupid and left out.similiarly in school , carrie is always the " black sheep " , she has not friends and she is always picked upon.she is very unusual and strange , at least to most people , especially the ones in the book ( story ) . ( but i would say quite frankly that i did n't see here as anybody but a normal healthy teenage girl . ) at the beginning of the story we also see that carrie has her first period while taking a shower at school.she is laughed at and all the other girls throw toilet paper and tampons at her.this is her first big humiliation . ( i am a guy , i know not much about a period , so please forgive my use of the term openly ) anyway , back to the plot:carrie soon realizes that she is psychic.she starts to practice using her powers gradually.it seems as though she had the powers since birth , but the powers were dormant until puberty or at least she was unaware of it . so , so far we see this:a very unusual girl with psychic powers and a stupid mother . the story initially and mostly circulates around these facts but things get a little messy towards the middle and end . allow me.... . it is later revealed in the story that the psychic gift is sort of genetic.carrie 's mother explains alot of things , but she is still a bad mother . ( but i still ca n't hate carries 's mother , because most mothers are sort of protective over their children ) soon carrie gets her first friend sue.sue feels sorry for carrie and helps her to get a date for the prom . this date is tommy ross.. . meanwhile , one of the bad girls , chris , is unable to attend the prom.so , she sets up a nasty revenge against carrie.believe me when i tell you , chris is a very jealous girl and if she ca n't have something , no one else can , especially carrie . so chris arranges a trap for carrie . ( two buckets of pig blood ) she sets it up for the pig blood to fall on carrie 's and tommy 's head while at the prom.. . the plan eventually succeeds . tommy is badly injured . drenched in pig 's blood , carrie is laughed at , for the last time.she runs out of the building.she then remembers her psychic powers and decides to use it for revenge . she starts to close all the doors.she then turns on all the water sprinklers , wetting everyone . but with a combination of water and electricity ( from the appliances ) ....some were electrocuted . eventually a fire gets started.and things start to burn ! she walks toward her home , burning everything within a certain radius of her powers . when she reaches home her mother tries to kill her , telling her that she is the spawn of satan.she eventually uses her powers to stop her mothers ' heart beat , killing her . eventually ( this is the good part of the book ) , while carrie is walking on the streets ( going i do n't know where ) she seens chris and chris 's boyfriend driving towards her , to bounce her . carrie uses her powers to diverge to car , killing chris and her stupid boyfriend . sue eventually catches up with carrie.carrie does n't kill her because she realizes that it was n't sue 's falt but chris's . ( during the battle with her mother , carrie was stabbed , i forgot to mention it , sorry . ) so , now , talking with sue carrie eventually breathes her last breath and speaks her last words and just , dies . ( this is the sad part , i guarantee you that it would bring tears to your eyes , or maybe not ) but this book is definitely good , i recommend it with all my " psychic " powers . enjoy.............this review was written by nigel... .

dvd pos 741.txt i found the film , " malice " to be a very intriguing and interesting murder mystery . sure , there are a lot of twist 's in the film , however , that is what i found to be very good about this film . especially the way these twist 's were done . there will be no spoilers in this review . the film begin 's with murders occuring in a small college town . andy safian ( bill pullman ) is a college dean who happens to be suspected of these killings . all circumstantial . moreover , he is having problems with his wife ( nicole kidman ) . something happens to her , and she blames andy for this . [to tell you would give away the film] it seems as if one of andy 's old school friends is now a practicing surgeon ( alec baldwin ) . therefore she decides to leave him and sues both the medical facility that caused her such grief , and the doctor ( balwin ) in particular who caused this grief to her . but there is more to the story than meets the eye . there are several stories going on at once . first , you have a serial killer , secondly you have a distraught wife ( kidman ) blaming her ex-husband and his doctor friend for what has happened to her . but there is more to her than the viewer suspect's . i will leave this to you to discover . the film is better than the reviews warrant . it is a very suspenseful film full of twists . recommended !

health pos 114.txt doug ritter and his foundation , equipped to survive , has come up with a very economic method to equip yourself and your family with an emergency kit . it is small enough to carry unnoticed in a pocket , yet fully functional . although you can control the amount of certain items if you put together your own kit ( something of a rite of passage among the survivalists / emergency preparedness folk ) , i spent twice as much putting together a comparable kit . the military issue sparklite and tinder-quick , fox-40 whistle , and rescue flash signal mirror alone could cover the cost of the kit and they are all top notch gear . this pack is extremely high quality through and through , from choice of equipment to packing and instructions . i recommend looking at the ets website at the slideshow of how such a kit is put together and what doug ritter himself recommends that you add to the kit ( the pouch can hold a few more small items such as water purification tabs ) . the pocket survival pack is an amazing value . i 've purchased all of the items separately , and just the shipping or driving to pick up 3 or 4 of the items probably covers half the cost ! if you are lucky enough to get everything at one store , you 'd be hard pressed to get the entire kit as cheap as this . i know people who have purchased this kit to take the parts for their own self-built survival kits ! that 's how economical it is . plus , if you buy this psp , a portion of the proceeds goes to the ets non-profit group which gives free survival consulting to deployed troops and is actively involved in improving survival equipment and standards . in fact , doug ritter is the only consumer advocate working with the governing body on personal locator beacons used in marine , aviation , and remote travel . the kit itself comes in a waterproof container . i found it to be a bit tight when closing back up , but there is actually some room for more items . all components are of the highest quality . it 's lightweight and i never notice it in a pocket . with the recommended ets or similar keychain led flashlight and a good pocket folding knife , you have a complete survival kit that rivals ones costing $100+. these are cheap enough to get one for each car and any camping / hiking / marine / aviation gear you might have . i highly recommend this psp . i 'm not affiliated with ets , but i 've come to appreciate their no-nonsense advice and forums . and if this was a bad kit , i 'd still say so . i give it 5 stars , great value for the price and it really could save your life
dvd pos 76.txt i really enjoyed this film , basically the coen bros . homage to the film noir genre . ( i always thought the name was funny , since it 's french , and yet most of famous directors were german , like fritz lang , otto preminger , etc. : - ) ) . the sure hand of the brothers with this material is shown in how the film unfolds with the cool , unhurried , nonchalant pace of an experienced private eye or gumshoe doggedly stalking his prey . thornton is great in the lead as the reticent , phlegmatic barber , and if anything , he is even more convincing with hair than without- -even his hairpiece is 50s-ish . : - ) the whole cast does a fine job in their roles , and both gandolfini and shaloub have a couple of show-stealing scenes . i found the film 's climax a complete surprise , as the tables turn unexpectedly on the barber , for whom everything seems to be working out up till then . overall a great film and probably one of the coen bros . best . if you 're a coen bros . fan you wo n't find this one a disappointment .

camera pos 19.txt this , in my very humble opinion , is the most useful , the sharpest , and just about anything else good you can think of say , best wide angle lense ever produced by anybody , anytime , anywhere . lightning fast and that 's what you want when the light is low . my gal pal sara and i have often wandered the caribbean islands in the dawn 's early light , as she is into shooting old homes . she particularly likes the gingerbread homes in marigot , on the french side of st. martin . i swear she must have them all on her hard drive . it 's like an obsession with her and this lens aids her passion , feeds into her manic desire to try and control the light . she just loves it and since i love her , i gotta love it too . seriously though , i 've used the lense quite a bit myself and it 's a keeper if ever there was one . you just go wrong with a canon " l " lense , no siree . jack priest , sailor home from the se
books pos 390.txt polanyi sets forth an incredibly relevant , radical , and all too plausible theory in this book . going beyond a mere analysis of how the market system functions , polanyi endeavors to answer the question as to how the market came about . polanyi 's answer will not be pleasing to libertarians , he argues that a free land and labor market can only come about through government intervention , and must be sustained through further intervention . he also argues that the market ransforms the nature of social relations . usually , economic relations were a result of social relations , under the market , it is the latter . polanyi attempts to show how a market for land and labor came about in britain . his argument that government " enclosures " created it through dislodging the poor and turning their land into sources of economic production is convincing . however , other arguments polanyi advances simply demonstrate a central government repealing the interventions of subaltern governments . polanyi 's argument that there was no " rent-seeking " ( he does n't use that term ) involved in the enactment of state intervion in the economy ( " proving " that this intervention was objectively necessary is suspect . one 19th century investigators conclusions do n't serve to overturn the implications of public choice theory . the greatest problem with this book is that polanyi does n't do too much to back up his arguments . he fortunately has a section called " notes and sources " where he lists his research material , but i 'd wager that most of this is difficult to find 60 years later

software neg 21.txt acrobat 5 was so buggy that i thought i 'd give adobe a couple of product cycles before upgrading . should have waited longer . there have been improvements in v7 : a better look , better commenting , the ability to add text that actually prints , and far better ocr functionality . but other basic functions are way worse than in v5 : some word documents that were easy to convert to pdf in v5 will not convert in v7 , seems to be something to do with font license issues . installation is a nightmare and repeated re-installation was required to get past system hangs , clashes with standard security software , and endless errors in the automatic update feature . the new product activation makes this even more of a pain because too many re-installations force you to activate by phone . despite my already low expectations of adobe , this product is a disappointment . with acrobat 7 , adobe is , as usual , charging top $ for what any decent company would consider an embarrassing mess even as a beta version . ( for reference , my system is window xp pro , pentium 4 3ghz , 2.5gb ram )
books neg 490.txt i read this book after watching the brilliant movie version of " the hours . " if that 's your motivation , do n't waste your time . my english teachers will cringe when i say it , but this book , well , sucks . it may well be great literature , but the characters are not engaging , and if it was woolf 's motive to out-do james joyce in chronicling a day-in-the-life and in writing a stream of conscious narrative , she does n't pull it off . again , the characters and the internal mental life simply do n't have the power that " ulysses " has . reading woolf is necessary for a good eduction . i recommend , however , that you read " to the lighthouse " . i may still be motivated to read the book version of " the hours " given how great the movie was . but my taste for woolf is all done now .

books neg 502.txt this book sucked because its like an autobiography of some idiot who knew nothing about what he was doing...his book is mostly life-stories...and stupid ones at that...some teeter the line of racism , he emphasizes attempting to hex some evil " fat black woman " and he demonizes some other young brothers later on in the book , i see most of the reviewers overlooked the fact that this guy was kind of out of line with his emphasis on " race " . and besides that , his 2 or 3 spells and such are old and tired...and there is no " self-initiation " for the type of voodoo he 's talking about.. . i am sorry but this book was a waste of time and money , i came away from this little book knowing not one single solitary grain of anything worth knowing . if you looking to learn about voodoo or vodun this book will not help . his title is also misleading because " voodoo " ussually refers to hoodoo and " vodun " ussually refers to the religion but this author isnt talking about either one....he 's just running his mouth on and on and on as if his life-experiences are even worth tellin . this book is a great example to why people of a foriegn back-ground to african based religions should not write books about it as if they could really know but so much.....this was a terrible book that this sorry author made about a system he obviously knows nothing about

books pos 393.txt a surprisingly tiny book . ( the picture in the upper-left corner is nearly actual size . ) after receiving it , i immediately looked up its dimensions in the description on this page . it says 4.7 x 3.3 x 0.6. i had not noticed that before i ordered it . the book seems much smaller than that . not that that is a problem ; it was just somewhat of a shock to find such a minuscule book when i opened the box . i believe it is intended to be carried with you in your pocket or glove box or the locket around your neck so you 'll have a chance to pick out a few choice topics of conversation before you enter a party or whatever . it certainly is not intended as bathroom reading . for one thing , the pages are much too small for emergency tp use . not that i am complaining , mind you . this is a gem of a book with over 200 interesting bits of trivia listed more or less alphabetically from " the amish " to " zero " . ( this is not to imply that the title of each page has much to do with the text , but who cares - the book is fun . ) each page has its stated " fact " and a follow-up paragraph to expound on the subject . also , there are a number of pages randomly strewn through the book with three " instant personalities " each - little tidbits of info about famous people . ( although , thomas jefferson got his own page , as did alfred hitchcock . ) and unlike another trivia book i purchased recently ( bla bla ) , the information here is actually correct . will and mangesh research their topics , not just publish un-provable " facts " gathered from the internet . use the contents with confidence .

books neg 351.txt i forced myself to finish this book before i reviewed it , and being through with it now , i feel as though i 've learned very little . i had so many problems with this book , or rather the way of writing , mostly stemming from the completely pompous arrogance of the author , that this was a difficult read . in his defense , he is , in most things , very thorough . my main and overwhelming problem with this book was that the author was arrogant enough to believe that he could relay what leonardo was ( or as he sometimes put it & quot ; must have been&quot ; ) thinking or feeling . while i give mr. bramly credit as a man very much versed in his subject , in my opinion , that still gives him no right to use what i understood to be a faithful biography as a place to put forward his own views . since he himself stresses that leonardo 's famous notebooks contain little to no personal thoughts or feelings , he has no basis for those statements and they are only his overconfident postulations . in the instances that there is a controversy over some area of leonardo 's life , the author is very good about stating that there is a dispute regarding the matter , but only puts forward his own opinion , and his reasons why he believes what he does , without explaining the opposite side of the matter . in this manner , he forces his thoughts on the reader without leaving them any choice in the matter . sentences beginning with & quot ; i think&quot ; or & quot ; in my view&quot ; are not uncommon . he also makes certain assumptions about the reader , referring often to other artists ' works with the assumption that the reader is as knowledgeable as he is about them . also , he occasionally goes into great detail regarding a painting or drawing of leonardo 's , often drawing attention to coloring or texture , without ever showing it , though the book has many drawings and paintings throughout . the author is an undoubtedly intelligent , well-learned man , very erudite where leonardo da vinci is concerned , but entirely overbearing in his writing . overall , unless you are well versed in the renaissance artists and do n't mind being pulled out of a book by the author 's views , then i would highly suggest staying away from this one

software neg 201.txt this program is average to below average in it 's abilities . that said , just hope you do n't need any roxio tech support . why ? because roxio 's support bites ! you cannot contact anyone online or by email for help ; whenever their dis-functional " web portal " [web-based support] system traps you in an endless loop . i needed an couple simples updates for a pc that is not allowed on the internet . it used to be you could download roxio 's patches from any pc having internet access . then burn patch[s] to a cd , or copy to floppy / jumpdrive . then " sneakernet " the patches to the pc needing them . no more . what happened today was that their webpage was apparently trying to download / patch a roxio product directly on my pc . [ezcd5 does n't exist on my pc]. instead of simply letting me download it somewhere , like to my hard drive , vs patchging it directly from their webpage to my pc , [which wo n't work in my case as i 'm not using roxio , nor have it installed on my pc] ; apparently the morons that did the roxio webpage coding make the download / patch process stop / end and proceed to send the customer back to roxio 's initial patch download page . when you need a patch , all these endless loops and support games are enough to get me looking for a different product / different company . if you want to minimize human contact with customers , fine . but let folks at least download the patches they need in order to keep their pc going . do n't hand over your customer support system [almost] completely to a web server . that ignorant arrangement works about as well as when companies try to save a few pennies and get rid of phone receptionists for customer service telephone calls . then they let customers wade through a 100 layer deep voicemail system to find the answer to a simple problem . it just does n't work . if a company wo n't provide access to patches , even after i have logged into their website with username and password , [so they know is accessing their patches] and they do n't offer any type of ftp site as a download backup option , then i sure as heck wo n't be buying anymore of their products . i see why roxio bought up cequadrat and other companies . [though i hate to see such quality companies be devoured like that]. when a competitor has a better product , why fight to improve your prodsuct 's quality / features , when you can buy the other company out . thank goodness nero is not under the roxio umbrella .

dvd pos 160.txt eraserhead is filled with strange , uncanny scenes . what is it to be uncanny ? dictionary.com defines it as having or seeming to have a supernatural or inexplicable basis ; beyond the ordinary or normal ; mysterious ; arousing superstitious fear or dread ; uncomfortably strange . i would want to define it for this film as the quality of being familiar and strange at the same time . one has the sense of having never seen such weirdness and having vaguely remembered seeing it somewhere . the movie does not have a linear , logical storyline . it is a mood piece , for want of a better term . a visual poem , which depends on what the viewer brings to the interpretation as much as what appears on the screen . if you let your mind play among these images , it will begin to invent meaning for itself . you may be surprised and enlightened at what meanings you find in it . the cinematography is stunning , not beautiful in any traditional meaning of that term , but arresting : you simply cannot turn your head away . will you like it ? well , i think this is one of those movies you either love or hate . think of it as a rorshach - - how interesting you find it may just depend on how interesting you are

camera pos 806.txt i 'm like most people with a digital camera . i take a bazillion pictures , develop 10% onto paper , and then banish the other 90% to computer storage archives . i mean , i 'd love to display a lot more of those pictures from my computer , but who has the wall space or time to organize all of those prints ? that 's why i decided to get a digital picture frame . i had been looking for quite some time , but was always turned off by the small-ish lcd sizes or poor resolutions . then i came across this coby 10 " widescreen unit , with the 800x480 pixel display ! there were no reviews on amazon ( at the time ) , but spec-wise it had what i wanted ; a larger display and higher resolution . i took the chance and ordered one and am i glad i did ! the display is huge , and the pictures look crisp . colors are pretty accurate when compared to that of my calibrated lcd computer monitor . the interchangeable frames ( it comes with a black one as well as the white one ) make it easy to match with your décor . the litte remote is easy to use , but easy to lose as well , so make sure you place it somewhere easy to find . the built-in mp3 player is a nice touch . the speakers are n't that great ( it is a picture frame after all ) , but it 's nice to have the frame play music while in slideshow mode . there is a variety of transition effects to choose from . i have n't tried playing videos on it , so i ca n't comment on that feature . that being said , there are a few things that prevent me from giving this 5 stars . 1. the adjustable stand is made of cheap feeling plastic . i 've seen other frames that have much nicer backs . yes , i know it 's the front you are looking at , but the stand should be sturdier , in my opinion . 2. the angle of the stand , while adjustable , is simply held in place by friction . it actually has one setting that it can click into , but then it is angled too much to view at a normal position . 3. there seems to be a software bug that causes the display to act weird in slideshow mode . well , to be more precise , if you are in slideshow mode and you choose either the fade , mask , or cross comb transition effects , then the very top horizontal pixel line starts to show black sections . it looks like dead pixels , but once you exit the slideshow ( or use other effects other than then ones i listed ) everything is fine . i have recreated this problem , but i do n't know if it 's just my frame or all of these . no biggie . i now use no transition effects it is perfect . 4. this is not really a complaint about the product but more about coby 's specs . on their website they state the lcd is 800x480. great ! so i ordered the frame and then resized a whole bunch of pictures to that resolution . however , when i got the frame and started using it , i noticed that all of my pictures had black ( blank ) bars on both the left and right sides of the picture . it turns out that the resolution is actually 860x480 ( which i found out after some trial-and-error ) . it would have been nice to know this ahead of time to save me from having to re-resize my pictures . plus , sizing pictures to 860x480 is a really weird ratio.. . kinda like getting 4x7 prints . i ordered this from total electronics ( one of the amazon vendors ) and it arrived quickly . when i reported the " dead pixel " problem ( which turned out to be a software bug , not a defect , so to speak ) , they responded to my email quickly and offered to take it back no questions asked . now that 's customer service ! overall , i am very pleased with this product . in reality , it rates 4.5 stars . i 'm the type of person that agonizes over something before finally buying it . with this purchase , that was totally unncessary !

camera neg 573.txt i bought this camera just under 12 months ago and recently the battery cover door would not stay closed . i sent it into nikon along with my proof of purchase and about a week later got a letter saying it would not be covered under warranty . the repair charge with shipping and tax would be $115.22. i am the only person that uses this camera and it was never dropped or abused . battery was only taken in and out maybe 4 or 6 times over the time i had it . for this reason i would never buy another nikon product again . next digital camera will charge without removing battery . camera takes great pictures , but ca n't do business with a firm that is very difficult to get ahold of and does not honor their warranty . bye bye nikon

camera pos 43.txt the case opens partially on the side to allow removal of the camera only . then after unclicking the fasteners you can unzip the rest of the case to allow for access to lenses . it makes it easy if you only want to remove the camera . you can swing the bag around while wearing it and pull the camera out without taking off the pack . my digital rebel xt fits with the canon battery grip and my macro lens attached , however it would not fit with my 200mm lens attached . my canon speedlight flash did not fit well in the lense section but fits perfectly in the separate section at the top portion of the bag . the lenses all fit nicely allowing for several lenses depending on the size of them . i bought a regular lowepro camera bag , but found that it was awkward to place the camera in with lens attached . this bag is designed to have the camera with a lens . if you search google images for the lowepro slingshot 200 you will see what i mean about the side unzipping to allow the camera removal .
camera neg 147.txt polarizing filters are used to eliminate glare on non-metallic surfaces like glass or water . they can also be used to increase the contrast and color saturation of your image . i use my polarizer not only to eliminate glare , but also to make skies a nice shade of blue or to get some " pop " out of clouds . there are so many options to consider when purchasing the polarizing filter for your needs . for instance , linear vs. circular , film or digital versions , or quality vs. price . if you are making use of a ttl or auto-focusing system , circular polarizers are designed to work with those features . linear polarizers has their uses , but they are manufactured differently and may not work . unless you are certain , just get a circular polarizing filter . there are some digital circular polarizers on the market . i am not sure what makes a cir-pl lens better for digital as opposed to film . i use a canon 20d digital slr and see no problems caused by using a supposed non-digital filter on a digital camera . most of the time , when it comes to filters ; you get what you pay for . does that mean you need an expensive polarizer ? of course not , just be sure to get the right filter for your needs . what ever polarizing filter you get , make sure it is color neutral to prevent unwanted tinting . spending more on a color balanced filter will save time in post . if you need multiple filter sizes , consider saving money by using step down rings . currently i use the hoya pro1 filters , as the canon polarizing filters i previously owned were without question bulkier and heavier . the weight might not seem like much , but when you stick all your items in a backpack all the extra bits of weight add up quickly . i can spend a good amount of time with my equipment on my back so this is a big concern for me . when it came down to the images , at times i would see a browning tint on my photos . the tint is easy to clean up in photoshop cs2 , but i do n't see that problem with the hoya pro1 filter . overall , i would recommend against the canon polarizing filters . i originally thought , " it is canon , it must be quality . " since then i have replaced all my canon filters . this filter works , but comes at a cost of disadvantages to other similarly priced filters . pros : can be used for film or digital cameras eliminates internal reflections and ghosting cons : bulky and heavy not neutral color balance
music pos 30.txt i would say that this is the closest that cheap trick ever got to making a perfect album . there are only two songs on here that i 'm not one hundred percent crazy about...the slow and gloomy depressing title track and ' on the radio ' , which i think kisses up to radio d.j. 's too much . i love the rest of this . this album was my introduction to cheap trick and i would definitely recommend it to anybody as introduction to them . ' surrender ' is an out and out classic and possibly my favorite cheap trick song of all time . like most of the rest of the album , it 's heavy , it 's catchy , has great singing and interesting lyrics , and it says all it has to say in three to five minutes . ' auf weidersehen ' is another favorite tune of mine...it may be one of the heaviest tunes c.t. has ever done . i particularly love bun e . 's energetic drumming on it . zander really rips his vocal chords to shreads on this tune ! another great hard rocker is ' stiff competition' . of the more pop oriented songs , i would say ' taking me back ' is another personal favorite of mine . probably should have been a hit , dang it ! ' how are you ' shows off the band 's terrific sense of humor...i particularly like the reference to one of their earlier songs ! the other tunes from the first half that i did n't mention are also terrific , particularly ' on top of the world ' . my only complaint about this newly remastered version is that it does n't include the lyrics , which were included on the original lp version . that is but a minor complaint . i do n't think cheap trick ever made another album quite as great as this one .
camera neg 259.txt i bought this camera in oct 2005. i brought it everywhere . loved it . in april 2006 , the lcd screen blew . canon replaced it with a refurbished camera . in march 2007 , the exact same thing happened to the screen and now they will only repair for $97.00 , as they have determined this is the result of impact damage . how they determine this is unclear to me , as it was not dropped or impacted...apparently , you will spend 100.00 / yr maintaining this camera . that , to me , is the hallmark of a faulty product . unfortunate - as i really loved this camera
music neg 855.txt while filled with talented performers , this cd sucks . rocky is a campy , 1970 's b-movie , that 's what makes it enjoyable . even as a stage show it 's a hokey , rock-and-roll extravaganza . this cd tries to turn rocky into thoroughly modern millie , and it just does n't work . the corny sci-fi sound and less than amazing vocals are just what make rocky..rocky . this cast has so much less enthusiasm and energy than the original roxy cast . and lastly , tim curry is frank . his rendition is too ingrained in my head for me to accept the twangy annoyance that is the frank on this album . ripley is a little too legit for janet , and the female eddie weirds me out . buy the roxy cast . it 's so superior it 's almost laughable .
camera neg 13.txt i bought this monopod about 3 weeks ago after reading the reviews here . i 'm not sure if i got a defective unit but i 've had these problems from the gitgo : -i noticed the 2 lower sections will not open and close smoothly , they would get stuck about 2-3 inches from the lock and you 'd need force to expand / retract them . very interestingly , if the section right above the one i 'm trying to expand / retract is unlocked then the operation is smooth and flawless ! -the ballhead does not support my nikon d80 and lightest lens ( 18-55mm ) a less than 2 lbs combo , which is much lighter than the 4.4 lbs weight limit indicated in the specs . the camera just slumps in one direction or another regardless of how hard i try to make sure the ballhead is locked tightly . again , it might have been a defective unit , but i thought i 'd point my observations out anyway . i wanted to buy this from amazon , it was n't in stock , it was sitting in my shopping cart and when it became available amazon bumped the price to $40+ , so i went elsewhere and got it for $30.
camera neg 182.txt do n't buy this camera ! ! ! prone to " memory error " & e18 errors after warranty is up . cost min $150 plus shipping to fix . this camera was great until 23 months went by then i started mysteriously losing pictures due to file format errors . i switched memory cards and it happened again . then the " memory error " displayed after a month or so of losing pictures . now it does n't work at all . i called canon to see what type of service could be provided and if they would fix what appears to be a factory defect since so many people have reported this problem . minimum cost is $150 or i could upgrade to a refurb s500 for $199 w / 6 month warranty . they have to be kidding , $250 get me a new one . for what appears to be common problem i was expecting more from canon . guess i wo n't be buying another canon . google this " canon " memory error " e18 " and see for yourself that canon cameras have problems .
camera neg 394.txt i bought this camera because i 'm going to jamaica and i needed a camera , the video camera was a bonus . when i first tested it , it was during the night time , however in a well lit room , but i could n't see anything . i figured i could deal with that as long as it took good pictures during the day . when i stepped outside , which was very bright and sunny , all i could see on the screen was white . i tried all the settings and still encountered a white screen . the only time i actually saw anything on my screen was when i was inside during the day . i brought it back right away , thankfully i had bought it at wal-mart and they were happy to refund my money . i hope anyone reading this review will take my advice and not buy this video camera . i would have loved to give it zero stars if amazon gave that option

dvd pos 544.txt this one is an old favorite of mine , which i pre-ordered on dvd the instant i learned it was available . i have an old vhs recording of the film , which i have viewed many times . i have also read the book many times , and i consider it to be conroy 's best work . this is the story of four young men at carolina military institute , a fictional military academy located in south carolina , which is of course a pseudonym for the citadel , which is a fine military academy that really does exist . the film is set in the 1960s . the first black cadet ( first year cadets are called " knobs " at the institute ) has just arrived . a secret society within the institute , known as " the ten " has pledged that no black will ever graduate from the institute , regardless of ability . david keith turns in his customary excellent performance as the black cadet 's designated mentor . the plot moves at a fast pace , but nevertheless does not feel rushed . purists have criticized the fact that the film leaves out many sub-plots contained in the novel . i feel that the movie made the right choices about what to keep and what to delete , and of course these choices had to be made unless this was to be a 12 hour miniseries . i liked the script , the acting , and the ending . this is a wonderful film . it is the type of film that most viewers will watch periodically over the years , and i am delighted that it will shortly be available on dvd .

software pos 957.txt i have used this software for about 4 weeks since posting my comment in reply to that review . having now had a chance to use the software , i can only say that i am almost 100% satisfied with it . some times , it 's nice to have a spanish dictionary when after a few lessons , you still ca n't quite grasp the concept of the word you 're being taught , but other than that.. . yes , it is repetitious . for those who want to learn another language , this is to be expected . no , it 's not a magic pill . however , in as little as three weeks i found myself largely able to understand what native speakers around me were talking about , even if my understanding of it was imperfect . repetition ( as they say ) is key , but even if it were not , dedication is absolutely required . you can only learn if you stick with the program , and even i have been rather lax about that much . still , i am wholly satisfied with my purchase . it is clear to me that the program is only as good as its user though , and i really ought to be more dedicated to following it
health neg 407.txt i really wanted to like this product after reading all their hype about how quick and easy it is . not . the motor in it heats up quickly and the thing stops working . you wait about 20 minutes for it to cool down and it will start up again . but by the time you are getting results in one area of your foot , the thing heats up and stops working again . i went through four intervals of effective operation , heat build-up causing it to quit , waiting a long time for it cool off before starting up again . finally i decided it is n't worth the time and aggravation , even though it produced good results during the intermittent periods when it worked . one more thing - - when i gave up and decided to return it , i took my duracell batteries out and they were blazingly hot . i worry that it might be possible for the batteries to explode from the hot-running motor . i 've never seen batteries get scalding hot like this . update : found something much better after returninng the artemis , i tried the medicool pedisenso professional pedicure appliance . this one costs 5 times the price of the artemis but is soooo much better it is well worth it . the medicool is plug-in electric and has much more power than the battery operated artemis . it has variable speeds , 5 different sapphire filing attachments , and enough power to operate as long as you need . the sapphire files are different shapes and sizes and should last a lifetime , whereas the artemis requires repeated purchases of its disposable filing heads and batteries . so over time the costs of owning the artemis will add up - - if the overly hot motor does not burn out . if you have serious callouses and corns , like i do , the medicool pedisenso will do a very serious , rewarding job . i 'm so glad i found it and i am grateful for the relief it provides
dvd neg 406.txt brainwashing is not a good way to educate young people about the world around them . this is a blatant effort to wrench young children 's emotions and therefore their perspectives about the eeeevil effects of " global warming " by engaging their sympathies . the only plot is brainwashing , using penguins as the straw man . the penguin world is factually well documented if one is interested in teaching children about them . as a responsible parent , i would avoid this entirely .
camera neg 245.txt i was super-excited to get this camera , and very disappointed with it once i did . the pictures are blurry far more often than not , even when resting the camera on a table or solid object . additionally , it 's so slow at taking them that any movement ( eyes blinking , etc ) likes like a massive blur . and the video skips all the time . it just misses entire parts . i would highly recommend not getting this camera .
books pos 187.txt i chanced upon this book quite by accident.i am a big fan of books which inspire.this may not be a book which is high on the literary quotient , the writing does get rambling and long winded quite a number of times.but whats truly awe inspiring is its straight up from the heart.its quite amazing that someone can go through so many emotions in a lifetime and actually make peace with all thats happened in a lifetime . this book will give you plenty to think about long after you are done with it

camera neg 129.txt i bought this lens based on the super telephoto ability and low cost . you truly get what you pay for , and this thing is n't worth a plug nickel . i took a few shots on a tripod and could not believe how terrible this lens was @ 300mm ( 480mm on a digital rebel xt ) . incredibly soft . even stopped down , i would never want to make an enlargement from it . stay away . do n't believe the fools who are novices , you will be disappointed with this lens . you 're much better off to buy the older & used 100-300mm 5.6 ( the l version costs more too ) but both are so much better than this junker . you 're even more crazy if you think you can take decent photo 's with this lens handheld . having switched from nikon when switching to digital , i almost judged canon from this one lens , which i 'm glad i didn't . do n't waste your money or learn the hard way like i did . this lens also had terrible purple fringing , almost as bad as the kit 18-55mm . after extensive research and testing i now own and am happy with the following canon lenses : canon 10-22mm canon 28-105mm ( 3.5 version ) canon 100-300mm ( 5.6 non-l version ) i will sell for the l version when i can afford it . the kit 18-55mm makes usable shots , but when i could afford it , i sold it too . you will get better results buying a rebel xt and an older 100-300mm than you would with a brand new xti and this terrible 75-300mm lens .
camera neg 638.txt i ordered this tripod , and it arrived broken . the assembly to which a camera is attached is made out of plastic . i asked for an rma order via e-mail , and they only gave me an address to mail it back to with a ' copy of the invoice . ' being lazy about mailing things back , and since it was cheap to begin with i tried repair it myself . where it broke ( the three plastic rings on the camera mount ) , it was impossible to re-glue , because of the torsion placed on those rings with any sort of pressure . even if your tripod arrives un-broken , it will likely break the first time you drop it on the camera mount from any height at all .
software neg 914.txt i 've been using quicken for over a decade , and i have to admit it is critical to my personal financial management . but i had no reason to upgrade from quicken 2004 until intuit decided to " break " it and force the upgrade by crippling certain features . quicken 2007 for mac 's feature set is not significantly different from the 2004 version , much less 2005 or 2006 , and is certainly inferior to quicken for windows . that 's bad enough but quicken 2007 is also way less stable than my prior version ( i 'm using the r2 update ) . it crashes frequently . bottom line , intuit should be absolutely ashamed of themselves for putting this garbage on the market . i for one will never buy another one of their products and recommend the same for everyone else out there

camera neg 689.txt so this was my first digital camera , got it last july for my birthday . i go to a lot of concerts , so i needed a camera that could take pictures in not good light and take pics of moving subjects . well , two days after i got it , i was at a festivale watching my fav band perform and the the screen went white . it would still take pics , only you couldnt see them . after changing the batteries and turnign it off and on , it went back to normal . alarmed , i called samsung and they told me the couldnt do anythign until it was white again . it only did it a couple of times after that so i never called again . but that was only one thing wrong with it . this is a horrible camera for concerts , the pictures are always blurry . shoot , even when im at my house the pics still come out blurry sometimes . tuesday i went to see my fav band again , and the dumb thing goes white . it woudnt stop , no matter how many times i turned it off and on again . now the flash is broke and i 'm ready to throw it against the wall . you ca n't trust this camera . you never know when it will take good pics or bad pics.i wouldnt even consider buying this camera for a minute !
books neg 807.txt the author writes a book that does give you a mental workout while giving valuable insight into the theological / philosophical foundations of the emerging confession . there is value in that . i look forward to reading part two , the liturgical ideas section . the emerging church is keen on praxis , but the theological underpinings of this book in part one reminds me of past mistakes within christendom , which i had hoped we were past . here are some things that i am amazed do not occur to the others reviewing this book , which it might help to know : 1. rollins does not think it 's possible to really " know " much theology with " certainty . " in fact , to claim to have religious certainty is to hold an " idolatrous " view of god that is more our idea of god than really who god is . this is because it is virtually impossible to be objective for us humans , and because in his view , god was not all that interested in presenting much of himself in any sort of nailed down way . the irony i could not miss was the dogmatism with which he himself expresses his own views . he is very certain of his interpretations of " perceptive thinkers like nietzsche , freud , and marx , " eckhart , augustine , etc.. . and is very certain that his interpretations of the scattered verses from scripture are correct . i found his use of proof texting for his ideas to be really , really , faulty . as i 'm reading along i kept jotting in the margins all the times what he said was a really pretty clear misunderstanding of the new testament . so , be prepared for a frustrating read if you know the bible 's basic content . he is certain that no one should be certain , but him . ok , to be fair , he is not certain if christianity is true , and says so on page 44 , but he is certain that he should not be certain of christianity . nor , i guess , should you . with his view of " critique of ideology " how can he be so selective of what he is certain of . this seems like a self-defeating ideology . so strong is his disdain for " knowing " with any real certainty that he would do away with apologetics as if it were no longer appropriate to try to base our beliefs on reason at all . i was reminded of the case francis schaeffer made quite well regarding those who do not have any reason to believe something is true , but who take a leap of faith and believe it anyway . rollins needs to reread his francis schaeffer , in my opinion . he says the church is not to be about giving answers , but helping raise in people : questioning . indeed , given his views , how could he provide answers ? this book may look deep . i propose , it is merely muddy . 2. he redefines age old terms . orthodoxy is no longer about the content of what one believes , but how loosely one holds it . certainty of revealed truth is dangerous , misinformed , idolatrous . heresy is now a cute little thing . it has come of age . he says people will think his views undermine christianity . we are to just take him at his word that his views wo n't do so , but he does not really make affirmations to give any reasonable comfort and any one would , i think , see the writing on the wall . 3. he seems to think the emerging church is the only hope for unity or evangelism in our time among post moderns . after reading his views i wonder if it is possible for post moderns , those like himself , at least , to even understand the gospel . he has not . how can he be a bridge ? to be a bridge one must have footing on both shores . christianity is based on real events with real content that has been passed down , not without mystery , nor without debate , but in a very real and tangible way . he cannot be a bridge to something by changing that thing to something else . 4. he is right to be kind to people of other religions and to try to learn from them . the problem that is huge , and no one seems to notice , is that he seems incapable of learning or appreciating the christians who are in other camps . he considers fundamentalists , and by logical extension many evangelicals , to be pharisees and the true heretics in his new definition of the term , heresy . i kept thinking , what kind of " fundamentalists " is he so angry at ? he blasts the whole of that group and by extension most evangelicals , making generalizations that are misleading . very unobjective . unkind . very divisive . yet he thinks only his views can bring unity to christendom . i can see his views bringing unity to all religions , but it will never bring unity to christendom . he seems oblivious to the amazing amount of unity that now exists in christendom . times have really changed in the past 20 years . he is either unaware or has a different kind of unity in mind . 5. he makes god hopelessly difficult . god wanted , it seems , to speak in a plain brown wrapper...the common language of the people , the dust of humanity , the lowly donkey ride , the obscure but simple truth of the simple gospel . rollins has wrapped god up in nietzsche and while disdaining " human reason " as the means of knowing god has turned the living christ who said " i am the truth " into an enigma of mental gymnastics that is so complex only man could concoct it . god 's message is simple . it 's clear where it needs to be . it hints at huge mystery beyond what is stated . rollins makes it nearly all enigma , hinting at some possible truth out there from a winking god , who says out of one side of his mouth something is important and that we will be held accountable for knowing and obeying it , yet who has been unwilling or incapable , given man 's weaknesses , or his own lack of communication skills , to articulate it in such a way that a person can hold any theological content soundly . if , as tickle says , this is the christianity of the 3rd millenium , then the chrisitan faith is about to become the irrational man 's religion , the anything goes religion , and following generations will have to deconstruct today 's extreme and irrational over-reaction to fundamentalism . peter , i can learn some stuff from you , and i 'm sure some of my perception of what you were trying to say was likely lost in transmission . as it stands now i cannot agree with you on several points . your views trouble me . nothing against you personally . forgive any kind of perceived condescending tone . i hope to enjoy the rest of your book much more , though , it will for me be an upper story with out a first floor . regardless , if it inspires i 'll come back and add a star . hmmm

music pos 770.txt really , this is only worth 4 stars if you can appreciate all things cheesy . this is , of course , funny stuff . really , it 's the kind of music where you do n't want other people to know you 're listening to it , but oh my is it fun ! this one has all the ingredients of your typical yngwie-inspired power metal-album : soaring guitars , high-pitched vocals , double-bass drumming , a lot of neoclassical stuff ( essentially the sound of mozart , bach and beethoven , just way less complex ) both on the keyboards and the guitars . and of course , trumpets and brass . oh , how i loathe and love the sound of trumpets and brass on a keyboard . cheese , cheese , cheese all the way ! if you 've heard any rhapsody-material before , a song-by-song breakdown is pretty unnecessary as you 'll know exactly what to expect . they really did benefit from the better production on their next album ( not to mention their latest opus ! ) but legendary tales does n't sound bad by any means , and the songwriting is solid and pretty diverse . it 's just cheesy , real cheesy ! and truth be told , since it 's a metal album the guitars could use a little more ' oomph ' here and there . this is more happy metal than heavy metal , but then again , they 're singing about mystical lands and holy creatures , so behemoth-like heavy guitars would n't really fit . we do n't wanna scare our warrior of ice now , do we

camera neg 904.txt the panasonic is very compact , very stylish sexy as my wife called it , but the photos are very disappointing : they are way to noisy ! even if set on the lowest asa setting at 80asa it is just barely acceptable and they do get progressively worse anything above 100asa . the colours are good , and it does take very good videos , but still photos are just plain bad when compared to other cameras in photoshop cs2. of course it is easy to understand why : the native resolution of the images . if one investigates such things , will notice that the panasonic is only 72 dpi , same as sony 's , canon improves this to 180 , and nikon is at 300 dpi . it is not just about megapixels folks , but how those megapixels are recorded and at what resolution . obviously a camera with 72 dpi will have more noise than one at 180 or 300 dpi . so before you buy any digital camera or thinking about upgrading to a newer model , do yourself a favour . try 4 or 5 cameras in the same megapixel range at a good camera store by taking photos of the same subject in the same light condition . set the camera for the lowest asa and the highest picture quality in jpg format , take the photos , pop the sd card into the computer , compare the images in photoshop . enlarge to full pixel size ( 100% ) , and and look at the meta data at the same time and you will see for yourself . that is what i did , since i was not very happy with the images my panasonic produced ! i had this camera for 11 months and 20 days exactly , and today i traded it in on a nikon p5000 after evaluating over a dozen models including the leica d-lux3 10mp camera , and driving the sales persons crazy with all the testing and spending 4 hours at the store , but it was very educational for them too

software neg 301.txt i have been using turbotax since i started working full-time after graduating form college . this year turbotax really drops the ball : 1 ) i did n't have any espp transactions for a few years . tax year 2006 i had some , and that was when i realized that nowadays they force you to use turbotax premier for espp calculations . the last time i had espp in 2000 or so , the deluxe version at that time could assist you to calcuate espp transactions with wizards . now you ca n't with deluxe version . 2 ) for first-time married-filed-joinly couples , they have to do a lot of work trying to merge their filed-single returns from 2005. the deluxe version simply does not handle this at all . even if it helps you transfer the 2005 returns , they do n't merge the data properly . for instance , if both couple have short / long-term capital loss carryovers from 2005 , the deluxe version does not do that for you . same for state / local taxes paid / refunded . worse , if even if you try to correct it , sometimes you can't . there is obvious bugs , and i have to choose override from the menu to directly update the forms . 3 ) nitpick : when you choose to print out the every forms , by default they print out all those only for federal taxes . i have to go to the state tab and choose my state , go back to the print menu , to print state tax forms . i am not sure it that may be because this year is the first year i use the mac version of turbotax ( i use pc versions before ) . but i really do not have a good tax preparation experience this year . next year i may consider to switch
dvd neg 791.txt with the straight story , lynch demonstrated none of the recognizable trademarks that transformed him into the director that i love . this film felt like a " blind date " gone bad . the straight story showed up , david lynch arrived , but the rest of the date felt muddled , confusing , and utterly disastrous . everything in this film seemed wrong . lynch 's choice for lead actor , the bland sissy spacek , the filler of repeat cornfield montages , all the way to the incoherent time spent on the read , i just felt that nobody had control over this picture , yet the randomness ( and the possible tear ending ) gave critics something to smile about . this is not a david lynch film , and for those walking into this with images of mulholland drive , twin peaks , or even eraserhead in their mind will be utterly discombobulated . the straight story attempted to show us a slice of americana via the cornfields of iowa , but for this boy based in the flatlands of illinois , it just seemed repetitive and boring . what initially pulled me away from this film was the technique that lynch used to introduce us to alvin and his daughter rose . alvin lying on the ground because he ca n't get up , the cliché use of taking him to the doctor letting us know that he is deteriorating , while bringing us the central conflict of his brother falling ill was just too much in such a little time frame . spacek 's depiction of rose seemed unbalanced and rather stale . she brought nothing fresh to this rather emotional character outside of a stutter and some unfunny scenes . i expected so much more from spacek with her timeline of cinema , but this felt like something she did on an afternoon instead of providing us with the intensity that she harbors . then , to add more fuel to the fire , there was richard farnsworth . again , he is n't a horrible actor , but it felt like lynch picked him because he fit the role physically , but alas , could n't master it mentally . farnsworth seemed out in left field for a majority of his time onscreen . i could n't tell if he was trying to remember his lines or if he was truly in character . his eyes seemed watery for everything which brought too much emotion to those little scenes , and seemed to bring not enough by the dramatic ending . his entire speech about his time overseas at war was pathetic , while some will quote it as being his speech of a lifetime , i saw it as babble ( and no , i am not that insensitive - i just felt it could have been handled by a stronger , more professional actor ) . the rest of the cast seemed equally as unimportant . i wanted lynch to either go 100% for this film or none at all , but alas , it felt as if he just half-ed his way through this heap . speaking of david lynch , where did he go in this film ? there were some scenes that i witnessed that screamed the director that i love , but then there were others that just felt like he took pointers from ken burns ' " looking at america " class . i hated the sweeping cornfields that seem to plague this film . instead of keeping us by alvin 's side throughout his journey , lynch gave us a repetitive view of farming and corn . there is nothing wrong with this technique when making the epic that one desperately needs to see once in a while , but when the same images were used over and over again , i nearly felt lynch was humoring us with the dulls of iowa instead of being the majestic all the critics raved about . i think he could have been stronger with his filler than what he was with this film . he needed something to couple with the authenticity of alvin , but the stock-footage that he chose to show was definitely not the balance one could hope for . i also felt there was more to be discussed with the friends that he met along the way . alvin was a walking storybook , filled with the way that he led his own life instead of listening to those around him and learning from their experiences as well . lynch made alvin very closed minded , which did not create a strong protagonist for the feature . alvin was a strong character , but i needed more with this story . i wanted him to make choices , learn new things , and bring that to his brother 's table when they eventually met . i felt cheated when this never occurred and felt as if lynch was saying that this journey through americana was that we could learn from alvin , and not vice-versa . overall , i was n't stunned by this picture . i thought lynch could have been stronger with his choice of direction and cast instead of what seemed like he just " played it safe " . the overplayed stock footage of cornfields infuriated me due to the lack of time that we could have been spending with alvin . speaking of alvin , why could n't he have been a stronger , better-rounded character ? i felt after watching this film that lynch had duped me into believing that he wanted to paint a picture of america , but instead gave us nothing more than soft music , recycled images , and stock characters . the stories were interesting to listen to , but brought nothing fresh to the table . i must admit that the brotherly love moment brought a tear to my eye ( since i have a brother as well ) , but why could n't we focus on this further . lynch made the riff between the two brothers seem like a toss in the pan , when it was the central focus of this film . the straight story could have been a strong tale bringing in a new image for lynch , but instead it felt jagged and old . i could suggest one viewing for this film , any further , and you will see how dull those cornfields really claim to be ! grade : ** out of ****

camera pos 27.txt do n't listen to the reviews that claim that this lens is not a good choice for cropped sensor cameras ( ie the 20d , 30d , rebels etc ) the canon l lens are the best and this particular lens is no exception . i have had the lens for less than 24 hours now and am in love with the sharpness and color already . great lens , great color , so well built , super sharp , just watch out if this is your first l lens , you 'll be hooked . this is a lens you will have for many years , great investment

music pos 465.txt this is , i believe , the best fleetwood mac album ever record by the band . it begins with a nice quick paced tune , " second hand news " and proceeds to move into many textured songs from there . the album itself does not have a bad tune on it . in fact , of all the ' regular ' albums from fleetwood mac ( excluding greatest hits compilations ) , this album has more hits on it than any other . hits like ' dreams , ' ' never going back , ' ' do n't stop , ' ' go your own way , ' ' the chain ' and ' you make loving fun . " all of these get enormous radio play . moreover , ' dreams ' was a number one hit , and the album itself held the number one slot for months on end , and has sold over 18 million copies in the u.s. and over 30 million worldwide , putting into the top 50 best selling albums of all time . in fact , an interesting tid bit from the liner notes of the cd describe how the album had such an impact on america 's youth that during that generation if you were to ask a student to spell ' rumor ' there would inevitably be two ' u's ' in the spelling . now that is a very strong impact on culture . every song on this album is arranged on the album as if it flowed right into the other making for an overall well rounded album . one of my all time favorite songs from fleetwood mac is on this album , " never going back " which contains some great acoustic guitar work from one of rock 's premier guitarists , lindsey buckingham , and , in my opinion , the best christine mcvie song ever written , " songbird . " now , with this release , you can also get , on a second cd , the various rough takes and outtakes of the songs on this album . this makes for great listening , to hear how the songs developed and were recorded . moreover , early demos are included along with two ' jam sessions . " now , more than ever , this is a must have cd for any lover of rock music ( or music in general for that matter ) . if you are a fleetwood mac fan , then chances are you own this album , but if you are just getting introduced to the band , then you must buy this cd . i highly recommend it

camera neg 529.txt this camera takes blurry pictures straight out of the box . one mistake i made was to not take my own sd card to the camera shop and look at the output . i thought the blurry image i was seeing at the camera store was because of the low resolution screen but it really is the camera . i 've missed too many pictures of my kids and am in the process of buying a new camera a short 2 months after buying this . casio support was responsive and tried to help but nothing appears to work . and point and shoot is definately not an option . i thought it would be nice to take quick pictures of the kids but none of them are worth keeping . i 've taken over 200 pictures and i will not print any of them .

health pos 959.txt shavers fall into two categories , those who prefer rotaries like the norelco and those who prefer foil shavers . for those of you who like foil shavers , this is the one for you ! i 've owned the latest braun 8985 and it was excellent , while it lasted.. . the charger kept breaking on me ( once in the first month [11 / 2006] , then another time 4 months later [3 / 2007] ) . it was expensive , and the refills were a pain , pricey , but they worked . after two exchanges i decided to try the norelco 8140xl ( speed xl ) rotaries , and while they shaved really close , they tore up my neck . the problem only got worse . returned 3 weeks later . i just got the panasonic and can say that it definitely shaves closer than both of the tried razors . they shave much faster than the braun and norelcos . i 'm not sure if i like the " side to side " pivoting head , only time will tell . the heads do n't pivot up and down as much as the braun , but once again , time will tell if this is necessary . one major advantage is that it cleans with soap and water.. . no expensive refills to hassle over . the panasonic has two noticeable downsides : 1. it 's louder than other shavers , but who cares ? it shaves incredibly fast anyway . 2. you ca n't plug it in and shave.. . you have to wait until the battery is charged and charger is disconnected to turn it on . this is my favorite razor by far .

dvd neg 982.txt it 's always a shame to see a really talented actor / actress star in a dud of a movie , but that 's exactly what happened to jodie foster with 1979 's " foxes " . directed by adrian lyne , who would later go on to direct the notorious " fatal attraction " , " foxes " is a cheap , lame-brained attempt at a gritty look into the dark side of teenage life . the movie suffers from a painful lack of character development and goes in a seemingly incoherent fashion from one scene to another , making it hard to stay focused . the movie is n't a total waste- -a few dramatic scenes do at least catch your attention ; and jodie foster , still under 18 when this was filmed , has a real charisma about her despite the fact that she is n't given much to work with . plus , that piano melody of donna summer 's " on the radio " which crops up throughout adds a nice melancholy feel . overall though , " foxes " really is pretty lousy and ca n't be given much of a recommendation
books neg 382.txt communism is one of the most evil ideologies in human history , responsible for the extermination of 100+ million people . this book ( which started it all ) holds at least much of the blame . communists were and still are a threat to the free world , and communism is a slave system . some " intellectuals " actually support the tired mantras of marx 's philosophy , whether because they are insincere or simply pedants who have n't seen enough sunlight , i do n't know . in any case , if they ever step foot in the real world they would take note that communism denies private property , and is totalitarian and slave-driving ( the government owns everything , including you ) . and the deaths caused by communism are hardly necessary to bring up . pol pot , mao , stalin ( of course ) , etc etc...who are these people kidding
camera neg 30.txt this camera is incredibly frustrating . i must admit that under ideal lighting conditions outdoors on a moderate to fully sunny day , the camera takes wonderful pictures . however , photos using indooor and mixed lighting conditions leave alot to be desired . if you want to take any indoor pictures with natural light , this is not the camera for you . the reason being is that if the flash is not activated or the lighting is not perfect , the camera slows down the shutter speed considerably . since the camera does not have very good image stabilization ( if any ) indoor pictures are blurry unless you have the hands of a surgeon . of course you can use the flash , but then your subject will be overlit , while the background is pitch dark . and forget about taking long range pictures indoors ( i.e. at a graduation ceremony or wedding ) because if the flash is on , you will get a black picture because the camera does not compensate the shutter speed for distance , it only adjusts to whether or not it thinks the flash is on . if it is off , your picture will be blurred because the shutter stays open for 1-2 seconds . since i take alot of indoor pictures , this camera is worthless to me . if you only plan to take outdoor pictures in ideal light , this is the camera for you . if you want to do any natural light photography , forget it .

books neg 658.txt this book is a disappointment . it provides little insight into the life or personality of robert redford , the actor or the person . the book is basically a chronicle of the movies rr has directed or in which he has appeared as an actor . but even as a filmography the book fails . the reader learns little about the creation of each movie or the relationships among the actors beyond the anecdotes that have been repeated numerous times on tv or in the press . in addition , the authors have the annoying habit of consistently putting down robert redford with snide remarks . there must have been something about the actor other than his white teeth and good looks that made him an international superstar . for sure , it must be difficult to write a biography of such a private person as robert redford . however , it is the responsibility of biographers to gather information and gain an understanding of their subject , and if they ca n't do so , then there is no book

music pos 976.txt joe cocker has one of the most distinctive gravelly voices in r & b history . he 's always stuck to his roots and never gone with temporary fads or novelties . this collection is another classic with great covers from the beatles , elton john and gary wright . his interpretive voice has always been the focal point of his songs , but in dts 5.1 , you are surrounded ( as if in concert ) by his presence . the completely adept and intuitive musicians that accompany him add more atmosphere without taking from his performance . imagine hearing him in live in a theater and you 'll know what to expect from this warm and heartfelt album
music pos 904.txt i consider this the first album in the second half of the career of oasis . following the departure of bonehead and guigsy , this album is basically all the gallagher brothers . having learnt lessons from be here now , oasis have gone back to a more basic style of production as opposed to the over the top production from be here now . while the songs are not as good on here , they sound better and the whole album sounds as if it was n't as rushed . this signifies a big change of direction for the band , with little less ego 's and a more sober approach to their music , it is only the songwriting that lets this album down . my least favourite of all oasis albums , it features two really good songs , 6 mediocre and 2 dreadful ones . it is missing another two songs to make it complete , i think it should have included the b'sides ' lets all make believe ' and ' carry us all' . it still includes a few beatle-esque songs ' who feels love ' and ' roll it over ' and noel once again takes over lead vocal duties , this time on two tracks , ' where did it all go wrong ' and ' sunday morning call' . this is a very important album , it grounded the band again after their ego 's had taken off . this helped relaunch the career and because of it they sound at their best today

software neg 387.txt i 've been a digital artist for 5 years and always loved and supported paintshoppro and corel products . i have to say i am very disappointed in the new version , pspxi . no problems with the download , but the program crashes easily , you can not drag and drop as fast as in 9 , basically is slower in everything you do . i am a photographer , and looked forward to the new photo features , which work , but for panoramas and complicated work others than one photo forget it . just hangs up and so slow you could go have dinner in between . i have searched the net and support wise , the upgrades and patches have not helped . corel is not solving the problem and maybe they can't . this is not a pc problem which they so want us to believe . i have plenty of memory and speed on my pc . it may be something involving how the xi stores it 's cache . not sure . but the changes are not workable , sadly . i think there are some corrupt files or driver problems that corel desparately needs to fix and supply us with , or they will find themselves out of the ps market . this is not just me talking , it has happened to alot of loyal fans . because it could be the better than photoshop if they fix it . if you really want the program , download the free trial first and or try the x or 9 version , especially if your pc is an older model .

software neg 730.txt okay.. . so i 'm not as astute in the technical aspects of software as some reviewers , but i can say that my experience with this software is absolutely terrible . first off , it is built to integrate with outlook , but does n't really . it always leaves one e-mail in your outbox ( the one you posted first ) . if you open your outbox before they send , then the one you posted most recently wo n't send either . seriously , the only way i have been dealing with this is that i have left a dead e-mail in the box permanently . if i need to change something that has been posted to the outbox , i have to open it , then get out of the outbox , change it , and repost it , otherwise it wo n't send - - ever . i have set nis so that it does n't scan my outgoing e-mail , as it blocks anything over 2mb , and in my business , i send things that big all the time . in a recent update , however , it has reinstated that and now scans all of my outgoing e-mail whether it is set to or not . i spent hours and hours on the phone with ( supposed ) technicians , who refused to answer any questions unless i disabled my whole network . what that has to do with this program , i do n't know . i tried the " live internet chat " function , but - - and i kid you not - - it took almost two hours for me to get ten responses from the guy . when i complained , he hung up on me . gotta love that . when i tell nis that something it has categorised as spam " is n't spam " , it does n't remember the sender 's e-mail address , like it is supposed to . it just keeps calling it spam and quarantining it . regarding spyware , i have another piece of anti-spyware software called webroot spy sweeper , that routinely finds spyware on my computer that nis did n't catch . this has just been one headache after another . their customer service was unresponsive and totally unhelpful , with not one actual solution to any of these problems . the only piece of software i have ever bought that was anywhere close to as bad as this is winfax 10 , another norton product . i will never , ever buy another piece of norton / symantec software again as long as i live . they should be ashamed of themselves

" fallen " starts with convicted serial killer edgar reese ( elias koteas ) being executed in the gas chamber as the man who brought him to justice detective jon hobbes ( denzel washington ) looks on . hobbes thinks that this is the end but soon has to rethink as he receives a phone call which tells him to check a house out where he finds a dead man named muscovich ( glen witko ) in a bathtub having been poisoned , the same way reese used to kill his victims . at first hobbes fears a copy cat killer but during the course of his investigation the name robert milano comes up , a decorated cop who apparently committed suicide . hobbes speaks with his daughter gretta ( embeth davidtz ) who at first is reluctant to speak with him . things become even stranger when the man who killed muscovich , charles ( robert joy ) is found dead in exactly the same way having been poisoned again . eventually gretta tells hobbes the truth , he is in fact dealing with an ancient demon called azazel who has the power to jump form body to body at will by mere psychical touch . the demon azazel seems to be taunting hobbes , ruining his life & career , setting him up for murder & getting to his friends & family . hobbes must find a way to destroy the ancient demon before it destroys him & everyone he cares about . charismatic leading man denzel washington is suitably cast as the protagonist and proves to have range , while john goodman is okay but greatly underused while the same applies to james gandalfini who plays almost the exact same character . donald sutherland does n't prove to have any range , doing the usual gruff routine that he does in nearly all of his movies . embeth davidtz is a talented and totally under-rated actress . she delivers a good performance and shows great potential for the future . the directing and camera work in this movie was superb . it was done in such a way where you can see azazel 's spirit go from person to person simply by following the camera up and down the crowd and watching the subtle touches one makes in a normal walk about town . although this film does require your full attention , it does not go unrewarded and you are not left at the end scratching your head wondering what had happened for the past two hours . " fallen " is an intelligently written , supremely efficiently executed , and one of the most unheralded , unnoticed thrillers of the late part of the decade . one of the better of its kind

software neg 170.txt as is typical with software claiming to be " topo " , it is not . expecting that the buyer of topos will typically be someone looking for usgs quads this software is not as advertised . since i own the other major competing program ( for which you need to buy each state in order to get quads ( and for which i can not seem to find wyoming ) ) , i was eagerly awaiting this package . in five minutes i realized delorme is essentially useless to the backpacker / mountain biker ( et al ) . you can order quads very simply using the package , but at the zoom level appropriate for making an ordering decision the wonks at delorme decided they would make the map blank ( apparently to force you into buying electronic quads at $2.50 a piece ) . so , you need to actually know the quad you want before you order it . well , if i knew that , i would already own the quad , and certainly would n't need to buy an electronic version . for 2.50 more i could get it laminated . yes , this is a flame , but it is deserved . delorme might be great software if you know the quad you want ; it is ridiculous software if you are trying to explore and area in order to decide where you want to go ( and then download , and pay for , the appropriate map ) . all in all , a complete waste of money- -i only feel it worth my time to write this review so that the suppliers of such software get a clue and discover a more appropriate business model ( versus selling blank maps , with a 100 dollar credit for maps that you do n't even know will work ) cheers .

books pos 121.txt i am a chemistry major and so i really like this book , however when i initially started o-chem , i did get a little intimidated by perusing through this textbook . so i suggest , to people who were in a similar position as me to also have a look at hornback or mcmurry . the text isnt an " advanced " textbook perse ( after a good grounding in the basics for three days , i found this book quite user friendly ) , its organization is completely different to most other o-chem textbooks and its presentation of ideas is purely mechanistic . both of which are ideally good things for chemistry majors who require the quintessential knowledge of structure and its impact on function and reactivity . an examples is that when introducing orbitals , and orbital interaction ; greeves et al quickly go to homo and lumo based discussions and their impact on bonding and antibonding . wade and mcmurry leave this , one of the most important principles in defining nuclephiles and electrophiles till later . a second example would be the appropriate structural implications of nucleophiles and electrophiles with respect to vacant orbitals , lone pairs and charge . these are the things used to identify em . as such , the book isnt fragmented . each chapter has its specific niche topic and thereofore individuals get a complete understanding of various topics and their implications on the overall organic chemistry . chapters are well referenced so if , say you are only interested in nmr then you can skip chapters and read only those pertaining to that subject and yet still get a good understanding . most textbooks act like a stupid monologue , miss a passage and you 'd completely miss organic chem . the chapter on reaction mechanisms is excellant , it actually is better than most primers developed in explaining this concept ( i.e. jacobs ) . however , the organization and the concentration of information within chapters may be daunting to individuals who havent had enough experience in general chemistry . principles of structure and reactivity are assumed knowledge . organic chemistry in most universities are taken by biology and chemistry majors . for individuals who are only doing one unit of organic chemistry ; i would suggest you look elsewhere . a substitute ( a less difficult but equally comprehensive textbook for people lacking experience in chemistry ) is hornback 's which is renowned for its lucid mechanistic explantion of organic chemistry .

music pos 140.txt actually have n't heard this cd , yet , i can still comment on part of it . i was the lucky guy who did the live recording at the x-ray cafe . sold the masters to the band a couple years ago and just now got around to thinking , " i wonder if they ever did anything with those masters ? " so , i was there at the show and can say that every ounce of energy that the band put out ( which was considerable since this was the last show on their tour , but they knew the x-ray was special and gave it their all ) - it was all captured on these recordings . the machine was a tascam 688 that used standard cassette tapes for 8-channel recordings . most all the mics were either shure sm57 / 58 , but there was also a high quality shure stereo mic overhead that was mainly used for capturing the drum kit but also provided a nice stereo image of the stage . the x-ray was perfect for this type of recording . the tiny pa was only used for the vocals , so , there was no competing with a pa blasting everything . i would place a sm-57 close to every amp . had a nice specialtiy bass mic , too . usually , 8 channels was enough to catch everything , but , there were extra inputs where it was possible to stack multiple mics onto a single track if needed . because of the overhead stereo catching the drums , this was rarely needed . with a full house , such as the night with the gits , any reflecting waves were just soaked up by the body mass of the crowd , creating what turned out to be a very nice intimate recording space . there was split box on stage which fed all the mics to the x-ray " business office " next door , which is where the tascam was setup away from any real danger . all of which made it a fun gig to record in comfort and be able to also go over to the stage side and enjoy the show . every once in a while , magic happened . d . fletcher portland , or
books pos 820.txt i bought this together with a " best of " cd , both containing a lot of songs i really wanted to play on the piano myself . that combination has allowed me to hear what vince played while also reading through the music to see just what it is he played . without exception , i 've found the written music exactly true to what vince recorded , including pick up notes , tricky min-maj-min progressions , arpeggios , diminished 9th chords , and what-not , and it has made some previously unapproachable passages much easier to understand . i 've also been able to use the book as a sort of learning tool , getting a feel for what a jazz musician really tries to accomplish when he sits down and plays a piece . i would like to have seen some fingering indications included , and without those , i think some beginners will not be able to do much with this work . and personally , i did n't find the performance notations particularly useful ( " laid back " does n't really convey much to me ) , but like i said , i also purchased a cd of vince 's music , so i already have an idea of what sort of sound i want to achieve . other than those two minor points , i ca n't find anything wrong with this edition . the binding is " lay flat " perfect bound , so the pages stay glued together but pull away from the spine , allowing this book to retain a crisp appearance and feel even after the pages are pulled open on a music stand . guaraldi fans and aspiring jazz pianists will gain a lot from this work

dvd neg 20.txt incredible does describe this movie - incredibly bad ! this movie does n't know what it wants to be . at times one can see attempts to recreate and milk the genuine rage and drama of " mississippi burning " or the anger and impunity of " ghosts of mississippi " , or a hybrid of those and bits and pieces of other movies of this genre . at other times it looks like its just trying to draw from the sex appeal and cheesy interaction of 2 of its main actors , matthew mcconaughey and sandra bullock . as a result this movie picks up the rear in that genre 's list of movies for lack of originality , and the scattered hodge podge statements it tries to make . some of my favorite actors are wasted , either by being given cliched dialogue , over acting , or being put there merely for their brand name with no script to support their presence . if this script is considered a great adaptation of a great book , then i have no interest in reading the book . i 'm sure the idea and the premise looked good on paper . but the direction does n't guide the story with any coherence or identity of its own . bullock is mere cheesecake and is unbelievable in her role , proving she 's only worthy of b-grade " miss congeniality " type crud . mcconaughey over acts so much ( as can be said for keifer sutherland and others ) that it can be said he balances out the under acting of patrick mcgoohan , kevin spacey and donald sutherland . samuel l . jackson should be ashamed of himself of not only his worst performance ever , but also easily his worst choice of movies to participate in . even the extras in this movie are horrible . enough ca n't be said about the terrible direction in this movie , equating elongated facial shots with drama to a fault , making sergio leone westerns look much more authentic by comparison . this is not " a powerful film . " it 's a powerful attempt at using a big name cast , a brand name book and a capable director to use material that they know would easily jerk the emotions of its audience , and in doing that they resort to all the cliches of this genre scattering the story line in so many directions , culminating in an over the top , pleading hunk of cheese summation scene by mcconaughey that would n't hold water in any real court of justice . maybe people claim greatness to this movie out of guilt , or because they have n't seen quality comparisons and classics like " mississippis burning , " that has both a great script and fabulous acting . i do n't know . all i know is it tugs from so many hokey directions it takes the final scene to remind everyone how it started . among the top of my most over rated movies

music neg 195.txt it is hard to imagine what the american songbook ever did to rod stewart that he would decide to degrade it like this , not once , not twice , but three times . stewart 's decision to approach these shop-worn standards ranks up there with napoleon 's decision to invade russia during the winter , it is staggeringly ill conceived . the problem , of course , is his voice . the selection of material seems ideally suited to showcase his limitations as a singer , which are countless . for starters , he has almost no range at all . next , his raspiness has no inherent beauty , and these are songs intended for beautiful voices . by their very nature , the selections are vehicles for skilled singers , their simplicity allows excellent performers to interpret and express individual perspective . stewart , because he is a rock and blues singer , never learned the fundamentals of singing and certainly never developed a mature , expressive voice . he scratches along the surface of these listless vehicles with the charm of a man skating over ice with sandpaper strapped to his shoes . banks of strings and fabulously misguided collaborations , ( dolly parton ! ) , do not mask but highlight what is wrong with this project . bear in mind that i like rod stewart ; he 's from scotland and he 's the prototypical brit blues belter . if you want to know what he 's actually good at , dig out your copy of jeff beck 's first release , truth . stewart delivers some of the best blue-eyed twelve bar wailing ever recorded . but that 's the problem . on truth it was the cigarettes , whisky , and swagger in his voice that made him great - it was n't about singing technique - it was about authenticity . here , the focus is on singing , and his limitations are embarrassingly spotlighted . albums like this never get made unless the performer already has name recognition that guarantees sales , nightmares of this stripe could never stand on their own merits . to be avoided at all cost .

dvd pos 956.txt david cromemberg did an excellent job with the adaptation of stephen king 's novel , and christopher walken was superb in his portrayal of johnny smith ( no middle initial ) . the supporting cast added to the film : martin sheen was a convincing greg stilson ( was this a warm up for his west wing role ? ) , i 'm a big fan of tom skerritt , and i did n't recognize herbert lom from his pink panther role . this movie ( and the book ) are put in the horror genre , but i would consider the story to be true science fiction . smith 's character was in a coma for several years , and the story 's premise is that this coma enabled his brain to tap into psychic ablilities . there is nothing supernatural about the villains ; they 're just normal bad people . this movie is not completely faithful to the movie . some of the changes are to make it fit a moderately lengthed movie ( 104 minutes ) instead of a 400+ page novel . some of the changes add moderate suspense , keeping the interest of someone who read the novel first . i do question the need for some of the changes - - i do n't know why johnny smith 's psychic abilities required personal contact in the movie ( he could learn things touching people 's clothes or a geographic spot in the book ) , and i did n't think it was necessary of having his tutoree be a younger boy in the movie instead of a teenager as in the book ( this made for what i considered weaker parts of the movie ) . true science fiction is effective because it takes a normal person , puts them in an abnormal situation , and thus investigates the person 's character . due to the time constraints of the movie , it did not as effectively deal with the wrestlings of conscience smith had , but they were not absent either . as a result , the story ( both book and movie ) have a feel of a classic tragedy . this movie is not for children , though it could have easily gained a pg rating ( this movie came out the year before pg-13 was introduced ) . the r rating was gained by one usage of the f-word , a couple of seconds of a revealed breast , and a short gruesome scene involving the death of a character . ( cromemberg has a reputation for gruesomeness in his other movies , like " scanners " , " videodrome " , and the 1986 remake of " the fly " ; this movie had him more subdued , but very effective . ) besides the r-rating , there are aspects of the story ( equally true in the novel as in the movie ) that i find disturbing as a fundamentalist minister . this is because of its dependence on situation ethics . adultery and murder are considered acceptable on the part of johnny smith because of the situations . in spite of these misgivings , i think this was an excellent movie . i think it was worthy of several awards , such as acting nominations for walken and sheen , for adapted screenplay , and for best picture .

camera neg 847.txt this is an awesome little camera . except that you ca n't use it at night ! there are horrible white spots in nighttime photos when the flash is used . apparently these appear because the flash is so close to the lens in this camera , and so dust reflects badly . it 's a known problem [...] also , it 's totally annoying that sony uses all their proprietary technology . as a result , the cable for connecting this camera to the computer is unwieldly ( uhh , have you heard of usb ? ? ! ! ) , and you have to buy a sony memory stick , which probably wo n't work with anything else you have . on the flipside , you can take movies that are n't limited to 30 seconds with this guy - i think that might be a result of the memory stick technology . but other than that , the design and operation of this little guy seems pretty slick . the lens is not one of those that pops out , so not sure if that affects image quality at all , but as far as i could tell , quality was good . in the end , what good is a camera that ca n't take usable pictures with its flash ? ?

software neg 847.txt i have had trouble and no satisfaction with this product . i am downloading grateful dead concerts from the internet . i want to turn them into audio or data cds . sometimes i get a whole concert as one giant file ; i want to cut that into tracks and save it . sometimes i get a bunch of tracks ; i want to combine the songs that " go into " one another ( my car stereo inserts a two-second delay between tracks ) . one of the things i want to do is to save the files ( which are mostly mp3s ) in the same bit rate and format as the originals , so i loose as little " music " as possible . the mp3 codec seems to be really buggy . most of the combinations of bit rates and codec strategies create really wacky files : some go 5 / 6 normal speed , others are compressed into chopped up shortened versions of the original . when i pick a combination of settings that work , i usually lose a lot of fidelity as compared to the original ( even when i 'm only combinining four mp3 's into one ) . try cutting one mp3 into two , and then recombining the parts into a whole . no matter what i try , there 's a little click in the place where the two files are joined . this should be an easy thing , since a lot of very basic editing is cutting and splicing . the upshot is , buying this was $40 down the drain . i 'm going to have to find better software for my purposes
camera pos 702.txt i have not yet used an fz30 or fz50 , but i think this thing beats the pants off an fz5 or fz10 as far as image quality is concerned . really nice camera . has a nice dslr type feel . 71% of people that check out the fz20 here actually end up buying the fz7 , ( as of today ) but i do not believe the iq of the fz7 could hold a candle to that of the fz20. buyers may be on the *more megapixel* bandwagon . you can do a lot with 5 megapixels . i have found that the iq of the fz20 is very close to that of a dslr
software neg 323.txt i purchased this product with the hope that it will help me protect my computer without too much overhead and interference . the password manager is quite useless . in more than half the times it did not enter passwords . in cases where it entered passwords , it took about 5 seconds to do so . it also asked me if i want to store passwords repeatedly for the same site . it interfered with the operation . it did not let me go to sites like paypal and charles schwab . when i contacted symantec support , their response is to disable the phishing protection when i want to go to these sites . my quicken started having problems . i had to restore old backups and it took me 2 days to finally figure out that it is confidential that is causing the problems . i would have given this s / w 0 stars if it is possible . now , i uninstalled the software from my computer and have no intention of re-installing it . i ca n't believe that a company like symantec releases software that is so buggy and unusable

health neg 495.txt the topmost review described these batteries as " aa in a d package , " which is entirely correct . what certain loser battery brands like energizer do is put a aa battery in a d-sized sleeve , thereby hoodwinking unwary consumers into purchasing an inferior product that holds a much smaller ( approx 2500 mah ) charge than a " normal " d cell ( 9000+ mah . ) fortunately , these bogus d cells are easy to spot if the manufacturer prints the maximum charge on the packaging- -that is , 2000-2500 mah , which is aa cell territory . additionally , the fakes are much lighter than the genuine article- -inside is mostly air . too bad i mistakenly bought a package of these . i 'll have to settle for consoling myself by boycotting energizer for the rest of time .

health pos 716.txt if you do n't like getting attention , these are not for you . i 'm often surprised by people 's astonished reactions to the act of putting them on and taking them off ; i 'm so accustomed to pulling them apart , that i forget how unusual the viewing public finds it . i have been wearing clics for nearly a year . i pretend that i do n't need glasses , but of course i do and have for nearly a decade . popped the standard diopter lenses out , and put in my bifocal prescription . it worked great , despite a warning from my optical shop . ( and even if they had broken from the experiment , the price is right : i could try it again . ) previously i was wearing glasses on a chain . besides the various difficulties noted by another reviewer , i also found that the plastic loops that connect the chain to the arms of the glasses have a bad habit of stretching . then the glasses slip off the chain at inappropriate times and the frames break . i call the color of mine " magenta " - which may or may not be the same as the online " red " - i bought them in a shop ( **gasp** ) . my short hair is not a problem , but i agree that reading in bed does n't work . so i use a different pair for those occasions
dvd pos 81.txt " above the rim " is an entertaining street drama that focuses around kyle lee watson , an inner-city high school basketball player who shows a lot of promise but lets his own arrogance get the best of him . he wo n't listen to anybody who offers him advice on how to improve his game , as he thinks that he is the best player ever . he 's been hoping that his mad skills are catching a college scout 's attention , but he does catch birdie 's eyes when he plays . birdie is a well known gang leader who offers kyle the good life so long as he plays on his neighborhood team in a " shoot-out " basketball contest that means the world to him . kyle- -being impatient as ever- -agrees to join , not seeing the clear danger that is in front of him . a high school security guard with a past knows the danger that birdie presents , and he is the only who has a chance to get through to kyle before it is too late . not only is this a very good basketball movie , but it is also an intense and character-driven drama centered around the choices that we make in life.. . and how we have to live with them in the long run . the film has some great performances from duane martin , marlon wayans and the late tupac shakur . even though everybody is great in their roles , the showstopper is indeed shakur . he gives a very masterful performance that really sticks out and will stay with you long after the movie is over . my only complaint is the length of the movie . it 's true that a movie that runs a little over an hour and a half is n't short , but i think the story and the characters open more possibilities to add on to the movie . i think more opportunities and risks could have been taken to further enrich the story . still , it is a really good movie that did n't disappoint me . the dvd does n't have a whole lot to offer . you can either watch the movie in widescreen or in fullscreen , depending on your preference . the movie looks and sounds very good . the only special features that are offered are movie trailers , and those are n't even that great . i would 've loved it if they included the music video , " regulate " by warren g and nate dogg . in fact , given some of the great rap songs that are in this movie , they could 've included a couple of music videos . it 's not a great dvd , but at least it 's not that expensive . i really enjoyed " above the rim . " it may not be flawless , but it definitely does more right than wrong . the characters are what really dominate the movie . even if you 're not a fan of the game , it 's still something to check out if you 're a fan of character drama . exciting , intense , conflict-driven and full of heart , " above the rim " is a very well done film . -michael cran

music neg 60.txt i have not heard of or listened to , this cd series , but from the sound of it , its all bad interpretations of popular music . i just want to say that if you want your kids to listen to music and you want to steer clear of the bad stuff.. . play classical music . play stuff without lyrics . play a show on tv where the characters sing . do anything but , buy a cd where people that are n't the original artists sing songs that were never intended to be for kids in the first place . censoring a song or cutting lyrics tends to ruin that song . there are just some songs that are n't good for kids even if you cut out all the bad words . think about this.. . do you really want your kids coming up to you later in their life after hearing the real version of a song and asking you why the song they heard as a kid is so different from the one they just heard on the radio and then having to explain to them that the song they heard as a kid was a clean version of the song ? listen.. . i 'm all for trying to keep your kids away from inappropriate stuff for as long as possible , but cds like this are not the way to go . all they do is make kids think that all music is going to sound just like the music on the cds and when they finally hear the real stuff , they 're gonna be asking questions . do them and yourself a favor and do n't buy these cds

music neg 739.txt i mainly bought this album because i was going to see them on this tour . in fact the gig i was at was the opening show on the tour . again , the band uses their patented formula basically creating the same album over and over again . i find most of this album to be very average . actually after listening , this album is not very good at all . the majority of the songs are cliché ridden in both music and lyrics . there are a couple of catchy tracks most notably " safe in new york city " which is a bit different but most of this album is cock rock at its most basic . probably one of the bands weakest efforts
music neg 622.txt paul brown is a tremendously talented artist and producer with a wonderful engineering background that allows him to set the standard in smooth jazz for clean production and versatile music . however , content on his latest project , " white sand " is n't musically expressive as the content heard on his first two solo albums . the artist collaborations on " white sand " make it tempting to purchase , but you quickly realize brown 's musical wittiness and versatility ( smooth , latin or r&b ) are lacking . overall it is still a cd worth paying for

camera neg 366.txt i purchased the wp-dc700 underwater case for my a70 and followed the directions exactly , oiling the gasket and cleaning it after each use . it leaked and ruined my month old camera . customer service was rude , blamed me and then tried to bargain with me to fix it for $190 instead of the $280 that they initially requested . the underwater case has a 7 day waranty and the camera is not covered for water damage . my father had a similar problem with his $1000 nikon digital which just stopped working for no aparent reason , they claimed it was water damage and tried to bargain with him to buy a rebuilt one for $500. so beware of bad customer service . canon 's customer service has all bad unreasolved reviews at the better business burea
music neg 490.txt i bought this album after hearing about them from a fellow beach boys fan . i 'm a huge pet sounds fan , but i love all kinds of orchestrated rock from " the left banke " to " beulah . " this album is not that good , people . it 's not even " okay . " there are way better takes on the " brian wilson " ( read : phil spector ) sound . whether it 's " the ladybug transistor " or " the apples in stereo . " heck , check out a great vancouver band called " ashley park " as well . the production on this is so rooted in the eighties / nineties that it 's almost unlistenable . they may be good road musicians but it does n't show on this album , especially since some of tracks use lamo drum loops " a la stone roses . " you would be better off going through the elephant 6 label 's recordings or even merge stuff . to be honest , i did n't even find the compositions that scintillating , regardless of the production . chord and change-wise , they 're interesting....but that does n't make the songs good .

dvd neg 117.txt what a huge disappointment this release is . i was suspecting that it would n't be all that great when i saw that the studio that originally produced this show , 20th century fox , was the same video company releasing it . well , the first season looks horrible . the source material is all 16mm dupe prints , some parts of which are out of focus , scratched and dirty . in all cases the image is soft and , well , like 16mm . compared to what fox is releasing of voyage to the bottom of the sea , produced the same year ( 1964 ) and at the same studio as boone , this release is nothing short of a disgrace . we should be given pristine 35mm source material , and we 're not . i suspect fox would n't release the original camera negs from it 's vaults without a substantial fee . anyway , season one of daniel boone is n't worth buying . i have n't seen season two , when the show started filming in color , but i 'm now afraid to look

software neg 550.txt this program sucks . i used it last year and thought that it was unwieldy and really confusing ( i.e. unlike turbotax and other programs , there 's very little transparency in the system ) . then i bought it again this year because the store that i went to was out of turbotax , and i needed to get my taxes done quickly . this year was even worse than last year - not only was it still unwieldy and irritating , but it gave me figures that simply did not make sense . the results for the federal return were ok , but it gave me figures that would have cost me over $2 , 000 in taxes that i did not owe on my state return . i ended up going online to double check my results using a cheap ( $10 ) online service recommended by the ny state tax website . within 45 minutes , i cleared the online source , and got results that made far more sense . i have no idea what happened with taxcut , but i suspect that they may have been missing a field somewhere along the line - this is a problem that has been noted by a number of others in reviews on a variety of sites . i will not be buying this product again

books neg 383.txt as a student of urban development and politics , i can confidently say that this book is a forgettable work of a parochial mind . davis offers a hardline marxist view of los angeles that , by employing simply economic analysis , does not allow for the intricacies of the city 's problems . class warfare plays a much smaller role in the sprawl of los angeles - - anyone outside of the iso should be discouraged from reading this baseless drivel
books neg 959.txt i purchased this book several months ago . during that time i 've tried several of the recipes - the french lentil soup is very good . the chili and corn biscuit casserole was unappetizing . the chili was so-so and the corn biscuits were too heavy to my taste . the recipe for mushroom , french lentil and chestnut ragu says to " see glossary " for the chestnuts but there 's nothing in the glossary regarding chestnuts . it was n't until i read another recipe ( smoky chestnut and sweet potato soup ) that chestnuts were discussed . the mediterranean salad sounds good on paper but was lackluster . far too much red onion ( which my guests mostly picked out ) . although a number of the recipes are relatively simple there are several with very long lists of ingredients that take too much time and too many utensils to prepare . as someone who works full time , a 20-ingredient recipe holds very little allure , no matter how good it sounds . i had trouble finding some of the ingredients . for example , the author specifies several different types of squash which i have n't been able to locate at any of my local grocery stores or farmer 's markets . the book is organized in menus which are not listed in the table of contents . if you 're looking for a specific recipe you 'll have to spend some time with the index trying to locate it which is not convenient . the author definitely has some good ideas but this book probably will sit on my bookshelf more than on my countertop
books pos 501.txt this book is pitched , at least in part , to linux beginners . but it fails in small , maddening ways when speaking to this audience . after a lot of discussion of disk partitioning and install , page 65 tells you to run the " man " command in a shell session . it offers no clue that the only way to terminate a " man " command is the letter q - a completely unintuitive action . so a new user can flounder forever , or at least until they get frustrated and reboot . but i do n't mean to slam just this book . that same problem exists in most other beginning linux books , even o'reilly 's pocket guide . all these knowledgeable authors seem to think that noephytes will somehow magically gain access to information that the authors have in their heads , but have n't committed to paper . except for that , it 's a very good book .

books pos 889.txt the story , walk across the sea , by susan fletcher , takes place at a town near the ocean . white people thought themselves superior to others , especially the chinese . chinese were often looked down upon and shunned , mainly because of their religious beliefs . the lighthouse keeper 's daughter , however , was different from other white people . believing her father 's talks about chinese people in the beginning of the story , the girl , eliza jane , meets a chinese boy around her age . after the chinese boy saves her goat , eliza becomes interested in the boy 's behavior . soon , she learns that everyone may not be as they seemed . this story was rather interesting in a way . the time of the story show how the characters act and think . the story also shows how different some characters are , such as eliza 's father and mother . ( " something moved inside me , like a sudden shift in the wind . " ) eliza was also , in a way , different from other white people . she befriended and showed kindness toward the chinese boy . ( " ` you 'll do him no harm ? i have your word on it ? ' " ) i was also amazed by the twist of the story when the story reveals that the father truly worries about the chinese boy . of all of the stories i have read , i have never found one that was perfect . this story is no different . when the chinese people were driven out of the village by angry white people , i could feel the same shock and anger eliza felt . the story , however , has a few more bad parts . one boy , amos , accidentally broke eliza jane 's nose while trying to find the chinese boy . afraid that he might get in trouble , the boy lied to his father about breaking eliza 's nose . to make matters worse , amos blames the fault on the chinese boy ! ( " i had a mind to shout at him , to tell him to put her down.. . " ) on the other hand , i did not like how eliza acted toward the chinese boy when they first met . when the boy yelled a warning , eliza thought he was trying to scare her off so he could steal her goat . therefore , when the boy was holding the goat , eliza thought that he was taking the goat from her , when what really happened was that the boy saved the goat from a wave . even so , that was not the worst part of the story . ( " ` get you from me , ' he said . ` i ca n't be near you now . get out of my sight ! ' " ) as a father , eliza 's father was expected by me to listen and talk to eliza about her chinese friend , and maybe even understand why she was protecting him . as a result , i was shocked and disappointed in her father when he told her that he did not even want to talk to her ! thankfully , there was nothing worse than this part of the story . ( " terrible things can happen in this world-things you ca n't explain away . it 's not safe here , andrew john . i ca n't promise you 'll be safe . but there are miracles , too-like you . and love . and glories well beyond our knowing . " ) the ending , where eliza talks to her baby brother about life and the chinese boy was my favorite part . it ties everything together and concludes the story about friendship
software neg 501.txt the creators of mia 's reading adventure would be better engaged creating movies and not children 's games . there is just way too much expository and not enough interaction to make this worth your child 's effort . if you 're looking to teach your pre-k / k child reading skills i 'd recommend the blue 's clues games instead . any older children would probably get as frustrated as mine did .
books pos 205.txt dr. mark albion is a consistent and heartfelt- -seemingly lone , sometimes- -voice of responsibility and truth in what 's often a cynical , clutching corporate world . i was energized by his first book , " making a life , making a living ( ml2 ) " and empowered by " true to yourself . " albion builds upon the strengths of ml2 in his most recent title with practical , actionable strategies for transforming your business or career into one of real social value . readers walk away with principles they can start executing tomorrow , and a re-calibrated moral compass by which to measure their progress . and albion lives it : while admittedly starting out with some privilege , he bravely walked away from a tenured position at harvard business school ( simply unheard of ) to follow his heart . to this day , albion continues to shun the easy money , and lives his life by the values he preaches . you can practically count on one hand the number of businesspeople out there who truly walk the talk . whether it be the insatiable drive for " more , " or just the rudimentary economics of opening the doors everyday , any business can very quickly shake you free from your social moorings . if you feel like you 've lost your way , or just need some inspirational words ahead of that next challenge , " true to yourself " is the book for you

dvd neg 329.txt let me begin by listing all the great things about the movie . 1. it is incredibly beautiful animation 2. the music is amazing 3. i happen to like how the movie is darker than the tv series the things i do n't like about the movie : 1. the characters are not developed at all 2. you get the feeling your only skimming the surface , like a starving person being tost a crumb of bread 3. it almost seems that every seen in the movie was stopped half way through the writting process . ok you may have see that i gave this moive a 2 out of 5 , well that is becuase of the story line and plot.the story line of any movie is much more important to me than the animation . the movie left me with a odd emptiness from begining to end . i just kept thinking there has to be more . but there wasn't . the best way i could describe it would be to say it was as if the movie were a lost child at the carnival that no matter how hard it looked it just could n't find its parents . this movie is for the person who likes action and no character development fluff . but if you are the person who likes well developed characters and story line please do n't buy it rent it first . i 'm not saying its a bad movie by any means , just a bit empty for me.just one more thing the escaflowne series is very very good do n't let any bad reviews of the movie discurage you from getting the series

books neg 950.txt although a majority of readers obviously loves this book , i have to say that it really seemed like a waste of money to me . our only daughter left for college this year , but fortunately i have trained her in time to be independent . if your kid does n't have a clue how to live in the real world and if if you 're still willing to do everything for them and not have them take responsibilities for their own lives , this book is right for you . not in my dreams would i have made lists for her what to take because she can well do this herself ! i do miss her and she misses us but that does not mean clinging dependency ! i expected different things from this book , on a deeper psychological level
software neg 910.txt since most of the complaints are from recent switchers i went ahead and bought this because most of their problems do n't apply to me ( running on powerpc , no old data to transfer ) , and because intuit offers a 60 day money back satisfaction guarantee . oh , and i downloaded it from their site , saving like 5 bucks . here 's the thing . the qfx file that quicken uses to get data from financial institutions is restricted . my bank offers the download , so i can get the file just fine . however , part of quicken 's import process is an internet check with the bank to see if they " support " mac users . by support , all that really means is the bank pays quicken to allow mac users to import their qfx files . if not , you get an error message saying to try the import again later . there is a hack floating around the ' net that invloves changing some of the text in the qfx file , and it works . but there are cheaper alternatives out there that support the format ( moneydance is one ) with no fuss . aside from this issue , the interface is really bad . it looks like a check register . if i wanted a glorified spreadsheet in the shape of my checkbook , i would have made one . the program is not even close to intuitive , which means if you dislike / avoid tracking your finances like me this software will scare you away pretty effectively , making your purchase pointless . lastly , the customer support is really very bad . you basically get canned responses that do n't even really address the questions you ask , in semi-broken english . i 'm sure that someone with banks that have mac supported qfx , tons of patience , and is predisposed to dealing with accounting minutiae would find this program useful / powerful . for me , all the advanced features in the world do n't matter if i ca n't even use the most basic ones
software pos 938.txt i first heard about this product in a bad review of a different software product for converting lps to cds . after a little research , i decided to try this product of the many that are out there . this software is not expensive and for me , it does what i expected it to do . it is easy to set up and use , and i am using it with an audio-technica pl120 turntable . the first lp i converted was stevie wonder 's innervisions , and with this album in particular , the songs run together , i.e. there is no separation between the tracks . this software allowed me to create fairly accurate tracks so i could access individual songs . i also cleaned up some background noise with the " one click " noise reduction , and the music from this old album sounds great . this is my first software for this purpose so unfortunately i cannot compare it to others . what i can tell you is that it is inexpensive , easy to use , and it does what it says it will do

dvd pos 218.txt this dvd gives a very good 60 minute workout . as others have pointed out the cardio is very dancy . the first time i did it , i felt a bit awkward with the steps , but when i did it the second time i was able to follow along with no problems . the dance moves are a fun change up from my usual routine . if someone like denise austin were leading this one , i do n't think i would play along . minna is by far my favorite instructor , so i go along with it and it ends up being a fun workout . i would n't want to do this every day , but it is good to have something different in the rotation . i think the toning section is excellent . i am not looking to bulk up . i just want my body to firm up and look better when i wear shorts and a tank top . i like how she combines upper and lower body exercises . it 's easy to follow and you feel like you hit every muscle area in 30 minutes . i use 3 pound weights at this point and i can see where in the future i might be buying 4 pound weights . minna is a great instructor . she has excellent cueing and is very encouraging . she is never annoying . i also have her optimizer - balanced blend dvd and i love that one .

books pos 918.txt this is a very thorough , very exhaustive look at the life of the sixth president of the united states , and while it may not be as easily readable as , say , david mccullough 's & quot ; truman&quot ; , it is certainly less dry and slow-going than most scholarly works . if you 're looking for a full-life biography of monroe , one that truly informs you on the subject and does not simply dramatize the story of a historical figure 's life , this is an excellent choice . if you 're looking for light reading with a historical basis , this is definitely not what you 're looking for
books neg 391.txt native tongue by carl hiaasen this book is fast paced , has a lot of energy , and a zany weirdness . no doubt , it is a page-turner . and it is better than the other book of hiaasen 's i have read , double whammy . but all that does not a good read make.. . a strength of hiaasen 's books are his characters , well defined and numerous . most are straightforward stereotypes , from the out-of-luck journalist-turned-publicist , the vapid sex-phone girlfriend , a steroid-doped strongman , the crude-and-sleazy millionaire bad-guy , a muscular-but-clear-minded black good-guy cop , to the dumb-but-intrinsically good-guy burglars , and loads of redneck florida " crackers " . hiaasen makes this cast interesting by having them jump through zany hoops , and by casting two characters that are quite original , an environmentally-militant 70+ aged woman , and an environmentally-crazed former-governor-gone-wildman . and we meet psychotic whales and sex-starved dolphins . etc. etc. so what 's wrong . mainly , it 's that the book stays at a level of tv-sitcom-gone-book . it achieves zero depth in dealing with any subject . one might think that the exception is the environment , but the story is so inane that it cannot achieve traction even here . so perhaps native tongue is just pure entertainment ? if you like brainless action , gratuitous violence , gross humor , and zany " fun " , native tongue might satisfy . i have one additional problem with hiassen , and it 's similar to the problem i so often have with michael crichton . these books stink of hypocrisy . crichton makes a ( seriously good ) living off nifty science ideas while constantly bashing that same science . hiassen 's heroes work hard to rise out of the trash heap of modern society , but hiaasen 's writing routinely wallows in that same trash heap for supposed laughs and zaniness . while i enjoyed a few sections of native tongue , i had no doubts at the end that i had wasted many hours that should have been better spent

camera neg 278.txt ok , i was hasty in this purchase . at first glance it seemed a small price to pay for a camera case...about $14 , shipping included . then i got the camera case and found the dimensions somewhat lacking in the space requirement for the camera i ordered . you see , the dimensions listed under " more details " are for the outside of the case , not the inside ( but it does n't say interior nor exterior , just gives dimensions ) . turns out , not only do you have to click " more details , " ( fine print ) you also have to click " more technical details . " ( finer print ) wish i had now . just wasted $9 for shipping on a 6 oz camera case . electrogalaxy will not refund shipping charges , and they charge a %20 restocking fee . so , at most , after i pay return shipping , ( the case is only $4 ) i might get back $2. so , yeah i was hasty , but i was also robbed

camera neg 15.txt as a professional photographer , i find myself going through 5-6 of these cords each year . my equipment is my livelyhood and although it is used often , i am exceptionally careful with all of my gear and do not bang it around or abuse it . i use a stroboframe which makes it necessary to use this cord to raise the flash well above the focal plane of the camera . these cords are very expensive to get just a few months out of them . eventually , the hot shoe connector will either become loose and the connection will no longer function or the plastic connector will break and your flash unit will fall to the ground . ( this has happened twice to me and fortunately i was able to catch the flash unit ! ) the cord is indespensible if you need it , but contact canon usa and ask them to reengineer this cord or expect to replace them every few months
books neg 260.txt i agree with a number of previous reviewers . grimassi stretches a poor understanding of historical context to fit into what he bounces between & quot ; wicca&quot ; and & quot ; witchcraft&quot ; . wicca is not an old religion , indeed it is not much of a religion at all . it has always lacked definite theology ( what is the saying about ask three wiccans what they believe and you 'll get four answers.. . ) and grimassi does more damage than good by presenting historical materials is non-scholarly lights . in fact , the book is poor on all accounts . from confused terminology to & quot ; chopping&quot ; of source materials . this is a waste of money

software neg 212.txt microsoft office can be handy to have . the files you can open , edit and create with it ( most notably .doc , .xls , and .ppt ) are probably the closest to universal compatibility among all your high quality options . it 's ( relatively ) intuitive . it has a pretty broad array of useful functions . it 's also obscenely expensive , considering the fact that you can get all of these things - - .doc , .xls , and .ppt ; intuitive interface ; and functionality - - for free . i hunted up openoffice two years ago when i decided several hundred dollars was an insane price to pay for the ability to write papers , make basic presentations , or put together spreadsheets . i was looking for basic functionality , but i was pleasantly surprised ; openoffice does most of the neat tricks , too . ( actually , it has a neat trick microsoft can never replicate : it 's open source , so it can respond to the needs of individual users . you just say " add this neat trick ! " and someone will likely be able to do it for you . ) it is possible that microsoft office has some killer feature you absolutely must have that openoffice doesn't . but considering the price differential , i would n't splurge on this before checking .
music pos 529.txt being quite the fan of grace slick , jefferson airplane , and other 60s groups , i bought this album only having heard two songs on it- - " daydream nightmare " and " outlaw blues " . at first i was a little puzzled- -the great society sounded different than any band i 'd ever heard before . after listening to it about two more times , i realized this uniqueness was a good thing ! they sound a little rougher than your average 60s band , and they were- -grace , her first husband , and her brother-in-law assembled this band out of a few of their friends and it only was around for about a year . the great society definitely is n't a band for everyone , but if you love interesting-sounding music , want to hear some of the earlier forms of psychedelic rock , or are just curious about how grace slick sounded before the *smoother* recordings of jefferson airplane , this is the band for you ! a quick review of all the songs : sally go ' round the roses : a great way to open this cd . pay special attention to the instrumental break in the middle- -it 's amazing ! ( any time this group does an instrumental solo , it will be very good . ) did n't think so : in my opinion , one of the weaker songs on this album , but a fine song just the same . grimly forming : an overall fantastic song to listen to with intriguing lyrics and another great instrumental section . ( i love the tambourine- -it adds an interesting air to the song . ) somebody to love : yes , here it is- -the original version of the jefferson airplane hit , written by darby slick , grace 's brother-in-law . this has a much less *psychedelic* sound than the ja version , but they 're both equally as good . father bruce : this is a very catchy song written about lenny bruce as if he were a preacher . fun to sing along with . outlaw blues : this is a cover of a bob dylan song , i think . grace 's voice on this is incredible . often as i may : another fun song that 's almost as catchy as father bruce . arbitration : this song is mostly some great instrumentals but features some singing from david minor ( he did rhythm guitar , i believe . ) white rabbit : yup , another original version of a ja song ! this song 's about 6:20 because there are 4 minutes of great guitar / sax playing at the beginning . almost better than the ja version ! that 's how it is : a cheery song with fun words . you 'll definitely be singing this one aftewards . darkly smiling : this is another " weak link " on the cd . ( there are n't many , thankfully ! ) it does have some interesting lyrics , though . nature boy : grace 's singing / recorder playing make this song memorable . you ca n't cry : this is a fun rock song , with the usual great guitar playing from darby slick . daydream nightmare : this is one of the more *psychedelic* and dark songs on the album , with great bass and guitar playing and more of grace 's recorder . this is definitely not a song to skip over . everybody knows : also a fun rock song , and yes , another catchy one . born to be burned : this song is a little less exceptional , but it does have a good bass line , and some good guitar . father : a fantastic way to end the album ! this song is a nearly-seven minute long instrumental that builds up to an amazingly frantic crescendo . not a song that will keep you bored

camera pos 867.txt i enjoy the convenience of a point and shoot digital camera . my minolta dimage x ( about 15% small in size than this camera ) had reached the end of its useful life , having been around for about 5 years . the minolta had a 3 / 4 " screen on the back . ( this one has a 2.5 " screen - great colors ) the best feature i liked about my old camera was the fact that there was not a telescoping zoom lens . i do n't like the fact that a part that needs to move so often has the possibility to get gummed up and dirty . therefore , i was excited that this camera had an internal zoom . tonight i was at a bulls game , in the 300 section ( nose bleed ) , and was able to zoom in and get a individual photo of kirk hinrich . the 3x optical zoom is incredible , but more so incredible is the digital zoom . i was also able to zoom into the jumbotron , and it looked as crisp as if i was taking the photo directly . action shots are great . low light shots are great ! it is exactly what i was looking for

health pos 298.txt i recently purchased this lumbar support cushion as a gift for my father this past christmas . i am a physical therapist , and have over 5 years of experience dealing primarily with the mechanics and mechanisms of low back pain and disc dysfunction . i have tried out many cushions over the years , and from my experience , this product is as good as any higher-priced product of the same intent . the composite board insert allows for a consistent shape to be maintained , so the cushion does not yield as easily to body weight over years of consistent use , and the burgundy cover is removable and washable . it is also an excellent size for the average-sized person ( my dad is approximately 5'9 " , ~170 lbs . ) . it provides good side-bolster support as well for an added feeling of comfort around the outiside of the lower back . i highly recommend this cushion when placed in comparison of other similar products . most of the other products out there that are in contention with this one are composed of unnecessary additives , like a massager , ribbing on the contours of the cushion , etc. i 've found that simply maintaining good posture ( not only in sitting , but all activity ) allows for so much more freedom from pain and simple ease back into daily life . again , i highly recommend this product to anyone out there searching for an answer to help alleviate low back pain ; however , i must caution that commercial products are not a cure-all to one 's problems . it 's always possible to alleviate the pain and symptoms , but other steps are necessary in terms of fixing the problem . i highly recommend seeking out professional care from a physical therapist , as it is more than likely necessary that one would need ( at least ) proper education and intevention to help one to get better .
books neg 66.txt i am a woman and was extremely offended at the portrayel of black men in this book and in the movie . the work offers no balance whatsoever which feels like a slap in the face . one black male in this book could have been something other than weak or cruel . it is no wonder spielberg was eager to take on the project and white people are going to the theater in droves . the castration of the black male has always been their main attraction , apparently oprah 's as well

health neg 422.txt before you buy , be sure to check where the pen was made . i have a number of older cross pens that say " usa " near the top , and they are great pens . however , i have bought three different ones in the past few years that do not indicate where they were made , and they are of inferior quality . the top and bottom halves are loose , and have to be carefully manipulated to come together without a gap . the first one i got , i sent it back to cross for warranty repair under their " lifetime guarantee , " only to receive it back unchanged telling me that it was just fine - and a " handling fee " attached . i was willing to believe it was simply an anomaly , one bad pen . so later on when some new colors came out , i bought two more - only to see that they have the same quality defect . my advice : if you want a good cross pen , go to the secondhand store and buy one that was made in usa . they are n't making them the same anymore .

dvd neg 540.txt while visiting some family in utah a few years ago we decided to rent a few movies to pass the unforgivably hot mid-summer weather . we ended up renting " analyze that " and boy , what a mistake that was ! we were expecting at least a mildly funny sequel to 1999 's " analyze this . " the potential was there , it 's not as if writers ( of course it 's never a good sign to see numerous writers ) peter tolan , peter steinfeld , and harold ramis did n't have decent material to work with ; robert deniro , billy crystal , lisa kudrow , and a funny and entertaining plotline regarding mobsters and therapy . however , this being hollywood and all , another sequel was botched . it 's because of movies like these that sequels have such a bad reputation . despite a few genuine laughs in the first twenty minutes or so regarding deniro and some " fish out of water " situations , the movie seemed to go downhill soon after . the jokes became few and between as the film laboriously plowed its way through an over-the-top heist setup and execution that felt about as inspired as " crossroads . " now either they ran out of jokes , they did n't have enough time to invest in an actual story , or the material itself has been played out in so many different ways already ( " the sopranos " , " the whole 9 yards " , " mickey blue eyes " , etc. etc. ) , that there was simply nothing left to write about

music pos 894.txt i borrowed this cd from a public library , having liked the track " crazy life " on the empire records soundtrack , and i was immediately blown away by how consistently good coil is the whole way through . it is their most mature album , full of gentle emotion and idealism , and puts the listener in a good mood . glen phillip 's voice is unique , confident , and beautiful . i fell in love immediately with " rings " and " dam would break " . the haunting and beautiful harmonies captivate . " little buddha " is so different but so good as well . after i got coil , i bought two of toad 's older albums : fear and dulcinea . both are really good , but something keeps drawing me back to coil . it is achingly beautiful , vibrant , thoughtful , and pleasurable . it is hearing toad at their best .
music pos 642.txt more like 3.5. so . half of this album is excellent . the rest is filler . but , due to " times like these " , " all my life " , disenchanted lullaby ( the intro irritates me but it gets better ) , " have it all " ( kinda sappy but i love the intro ) , " low " ( have you seen the video ? ) and " overdrive " ( again , kinda sappy but there 's something about it i love ) , the album is pretty enjoyable . it does n't compare to the first three , but it has its moments . the riffs are slightly heavier , most songs are pretty upbeat . " times like these " is an instant classic with awesome lyrics , while " all my life " rocks harder than pretty much all previous songs . kinda sucks how the best songs are / were singles , but if they had released other songs , no-one would buy the album . mind you , my friend loves " burn away " , so listen to the previews and make your own mind up
dvd pos 131.txt john waters is a very brilliant and odd film director . he brings camp , trash , filth , humor and morality to all of his movies , pushes peoples buttons , goes farther than most dare ( and then some ) isnt afraid of being censored and does what he does and to me thats brillance . true alot of people will think his work is tasteless stupid and gross but thats the whole point ! lol ! people who dont have a sense of humor or who are not open minded will not like his movies . these are not for right wing conservatives but they should see them ( especially a dirty shame ) to broaden their minds a little more . my personal favorites are pink flamingos , a dirty shame , female trouble , polyester and desperate living . serial mom is also a fav but not in this collection . he has come from underground trash to queen of filth , trash and crudeness and for not being afraid of being bold , outlandish , outspoken and bizzar , i applaud you john waters . brillant
music neg 990.txt there 's always the argument that if bach had had a modern piano , he would have composed for it . let 's consider another possibility : if some style-insensitive time machine had delivered a piano to bach 's doorstep , he might have tried it out and rejected it as a bad idea , since it so obviously fails to serve the paramount musical ideals that inspired the high baroque composers . for listeners who understand what bach meant by equal temperament , it 's worth noting that the standard temperament of the modern piano bears no close connection to what bach was trying to demonstrate in these " pedagogical " compositions . in other words , the point is lost .
software pos 505.txt why buy the upgrade when you can buy the full version ? basically cause it was cheap . you will see , old version , new version , 10.4.6 , 10 , 4 , 8 and so on . i just bought the old version and installed the latest update . now i am up to date and for a lot less money which meant i could spend the extra cash on more software for my mac . as far as performance , no faster than jaguar or panther . the benchmarks say faster but if you stare at the screen in any version , the 10 nano seconds you save are not noticable . you will encounter drive issues at some point as this version appears to have issues more often . this seems to be due to the new journaling scheme but i cannot back this up . if possible i recommend you erase the drive you are installing to . in the disk utility , select the erase tab , and then the security button , select the zero out data option . note : you cannot erase a drive but only a volume . this will clear out any corrupt data and pinpoint any bad or damaged sectors . the main reason i wanted this was for the widgets . they are a blessing . calculator , thesarus , package tracking , and many more . tiger only comes with about a dozen widgets but in the widget configuration button , you will see the more widgets option . you will be directed to hundreds of others widgets for immediate and free installation . my favorite is the weather and radar widget as i work outdoors a lot . i am able to quickly see the latest radar and plan my week , all by press f12. no need to interupt what i am doing on the mac as the widgets will pop up in my layout and my activities stay active . click any area other than a widget and they hide away . if you want to wait for a version of the osx that allows you to write your own widgets without taking a programming course , wait for leopard
music neg 864.txt this cd should not have been released because it adds really nothing to this jarrett quartet 's other three releases . it 's like taking a fat paint brush full of cheap house paint and making a greasy mess of what was a very beautiful triptych . " belonging , " " my song , " and " nude ants " are all virtuoso , spiritually empowered performances and should by all means be purchased and enjoyed . but , i 'd go nada on this one if i were you . i was sitting with my 88-year-old mother listening to the last track and complaining about how lame it was and she said it was " hum-drum . " and she 's 88 , likes lawrence welk and it was past her bedtime . ( it 's past " late night willie 's " bedtime too , i hate to tell you . ) heck , i 've heard high school jazz bands cook twice as hot as this " keith and the somnambulists " incarnation . garbarek sounds like he 's going to give himself a hernia trying to get out the altissimos . i ca n't think of one interesting drum riff in the whole 61 minutes plus . ( neither can christensen . ) les scandinavianes sound like they need about 10 hours sleep and then , maybe , they start thinking about picking up musical instruments . jarrett is as wired as ever , but even he ca n't keep up with some of the tempos and the overall mood is disoriented , forced and cumbersome . how any reviewer can say that this release captures the quartet 's tight integration , displayed amazingly well elsewhere , is beyond me . with the exception of " innocence , " none of the compositions are very good , either . " oasis " has an interesting , if dire , melody line , but it ca n't summon the required ambience because of all of the clutter and dog poop around it . unlike the other three releases mentioned above , this one has very little magnetism - the first track is all rambling rose jazz , where none of the musicians are feeding off each other . i do n't enjoy this kind of jazz , so cliched and unintegrated . it contains that jarrettian need to rush things and gang jump the tempo with heavy-handed neurosis peddled as jazz fusion . you feel like some nut in a bmw is suddenly sitting 10 inches off your bumper , too demented to use the passing lane . ( yes , i know keith has mastered his scales and likes to crack knuckles with tempos and , yes , i now have a headache . ) there is an interesting part at the end , however , where garbarek cuts way back on the throttle and swaggers around in the lower and upper registers of his tenor sax in some nice ways . but the transition is contrived at best and bears no organic relation to the first part . only " innocence " benefits from the fact that these guys are probably taking a red eye flight to new york soon . it is a beautiful lullabye , arguably jarrett 's best composition . true , the " nude ants " version is all you need really , but something happens on this version of the song that is very special . jarrett puts in one of his best , if not his best , jazz piano performances . the composition is perfectly suited to his virtuosity and sensitivities and the somnambulists , who are still pulling a code 9 , ca n't screw it up even if they want to . ( there is a halo around keith jarrett 's head i bet you . ) garbarek ( somnambulist #1 ) plays the melody with a lot of heart , but he screws up the tempo in a very brief , weak improvisation . the man is tapped , knows it and decides it 's time to end the song . palle danielsson ( somnambulist #2 ) misses a lot of notes ( doubly bad on double bass ) and goes off into an ill-conceived , top-heavy improvisation right at the beginning of the song . like garbarek , he knows enough to stop and retreat , letting jarrett take over . i ca n't remember a dang thing about somnambulist #3 ( christensen ) . but jarrett 's effort cannot be touched and he plays like a true wizard . a week later at the village vangard ( " nude ants " ) , they 'll all be playing at this level . if anything , i 'd like to see the pm version of " innocence " included in a compilation of the best concert performances by this quartet rather than a whole release of this mediocre concert . for the most part here , we get hum-drum mountains , where many of the great riffs from the releases mentioned above are handled like a shaky old butler serving up tea , with people getting burned and tablecloths getting ruined . in particular , garbarek 's performance on " nude ants " is far superior to this one and maybe the mean streets of greenwich village got his " norwegian up . " maybe they were n't so sure if they were going to make it back to the hotel alive - new york used to be like this you know - and , well , it just might be your last gig . on " personal mountains , " it 's all polite " thank yous " and japanese clapping robotically . not a tinkling glass of booze in the whole schmooze . not even a bonze meditating for more . but , that manfred eicher , such a card , i tell you .

books pos 537.txt i 'm not a huge fan of this genre of music , but as a very part-time musician , this book was recommended by a fellow friend and musician . i liked this book alot and found it education and entertaining , even if the subject matter was not of immense interest . this is definitely not the fault of the author , who did a fine job of making this subject engaging . thus , i found the read illuminating to no small degree . i learned alot about the roots of punk , how it spread and rose , and the end of it . by correctly defining the terms of the book " the indie years " , we only see what happens to the bands in their formative years . once they sign with a major label , their story is ended . this was both a good idea and frustrating one , as we see the birth and growth of bands , but not what happens to them ( in most cases ) once they hit a major label . frequently , signing with a major label creates / expands both the zeniths and nadirs for a band and i would have liked to have known what happened from there . regardless , this book is well-written and a great read for any person who likes the bands included in the book .
dvd pos 150.txt tim burton offers the most charmingly off-beat yet visually sumptuous movies in hollywood . from his stop-animation work ( " the corpse bride " ) to dark romances ( " edward scissorhands " ) to horror ( " sleepy hollow " ) , burton never fails to offer feasts for the eyes that manage to make you squirm just a bit uncomfortably - all the right notes are there , but some are played just off-key enough to create the thrill of tension . perhaps no other director was so suited to film roald dahl 's most famous work , " charlie and the chocolate factory , " and remain true to the author 's vision . most people associate the tamer , goofy " willie wonka and the chocolate factory , " starring gene wilder , with dahl 's tale , but forget that dahl had a healthy streak of lemony snicket sensibility to him . so it is perfect that burton makes a darker , more dangerous film for all to enjoy . the visuals in " charlie " are astounding . the chocolate waterfall and river look like actual liquid chocolate ( not the icky brown water of " willie wonka " ) , and the squirrel-nut-sorting room is a classic of mind-blowing set design . and that is not all - oh , no , that is not all ! possibly the most visually stunning element in " charlie " is willie wonka himself , played by burton favorite johnny depp . depp sinks so deep into his roles that he becomes one with them , and one wonders what inspired depp 's quirky , nervous , mean-spirited , selfish concoction . depp plays wonka as tight as he plays jack sparrow loose , and he never misses a note . but whereas gene wilder 's willie wonka was more genial puppetmaster , depp 's wonka has a sadistic streak in him , perhaps instilled by his dentist father . this is a great , if much-maligned , performance . the most infamous element from the first movie was the seemingly-drug-inspired presence of the oompa-loompas , wonka 's army of diminutive henchmen . in the wilder film , the oompa-loompas were dwarfs given to sophomoric dance numbers to the irritatingly catchy " oompa-loompa-do-be-de-do " tune . in this version , all the oompa-loompas are played by the same character ( even though there are hundreds of them ) , and their dance numbers are even more fantastic . however , the songs do n't have quite the same sharp punch as the original songs , which pointed out the various failings of the kids and their parents as they got eliminated from the contest . indeed , there are several lyrics that i just could n't catch in this film version , and that is a pretty major quibble . far from a feel-good movie , but definitely a good movie , " charlie and the chocolate factory " deserves to be seen and , for fans of artistic visions , studied .

music pos 734.txt those who liked suede may be looking for more of the same from the tears , but despite the obviously recognisable vocals from brett , and the familiar wailing of bernard 's guitar , this marks a watershed in their repertoire . the most obvious difference is that all the songs seem to have been crafted as ' hits ' ( much more radio-friendly , and why not ? ) . it 's also a more mellow sound than suede ( there were fewer opportunities for vigorous bouncing and hand-clapping at the tears concert i attended ) . another important difference is the guitar work , with bernard soaring off into sonic highs not experienced since reeves gabrels and tin machine . among the better songs are apollo 13 , brave new century , refugees and co-star . though brett and bernard are capable of better , this is a shot in the arm for us disenfranchised suede-heads , and i recommend you turn it up loud
camera neg 47.txt i got this for my s70. first off , in order to use it , you have to set the s70 to " radio control " ( about 9 button pushes ) . then you had better stay no further away than six feet or so ( and only in *front* of the camera-the remote does n't work from the rear ! ) . oh , and if you want to adjust your framing , forget it-the zoom is immobilized . if you need a " cable release , " i strongly suggest simply using the self-timer built into the camera . it gives you 2-second and 10-second settings , and you 're almost certain to have a steady tripod by that time .

books neg 492.txt i 'm perhaps the only steinbeck lover not to have yet read " grapes of wrath " or " east of eden . " instead i have focused on " of mice and men " and his lesser known works , such as " to a god unknown " and , my personal favorite , " pastures of heaven . " i 've been enamored with his ability to vividly craft characters in particular . when i began reading " in dubious battle , " it appeared the most engaging of all steinbeck 's work . telling the story of american communist party workers jim and mac , it begins with the story of hardscrabble jim initiating himself into mac 's radical cell . there is a great ( and misleading ) sense of intrigue - mac and jim travel by boxcar , work secretly through letters , go from secret contact to contact and finally arrive among disgruntled orchard workers . early on , the pace is fast , exciting , and engaging . suddenly , steinbeck simply fails to deliver , leaving the reader wondering when he 's going to pick up the pace again . after jim and mac slowly initiate a worker 's strike , i expected the sense of excitement to continue . it simply never does . summary of " in dubious battle " - workers get mad . workers get tired . workers get mad . workers get tired . workers get mad . workers get tired . the rest of the book mostly concerns jim and mac talking - and talking - and talking - and talking . and while their philosophical chats are mildly interesting at first , they simply repeat themselves for the rest of the book . most of the action takes place in the dark or far away from the narration , and most of the story simply concerns the strikers bickering over petty nonsense.. . ...and eating . steinbeck must have been peckish while writing this story , because at least a good 25% of the story concerns finding , eating , and ( worst of all ) talking about food . there is plenty of action that steinbeck could have shown during the story , but for some reason he prefers to focus on jim and mac endlessly walking from tent to tent in their encampment , discussing whatever comes to mind . steinbeck 's sense of intrigue and social injustice is worth reading the first few chapters . but i advise any reader of " in dubious battle " to take this course - after the strike is initiated , simply set the book down . you wo n't miss anything . nothing of great import happens , and only a very few memorable characters ever surface , and they are lost among the sea of forgettable faces . i suppose now i 'll give " grapes of wrath " a go . perhaps if it is n't one of his " greats , " it is n't worth reading
music pos 651.txt this is a wonderful view into what is the best and worst about a tedeschi concert . she can be as soulful as the best of the blues singers but it also exposes her weakness : she just ca n't rock enough to provide the balance her act needs . she 's terrific on the ballads but is n't a good enough guitar player to hold up the guitar playing for a band so they have to make do with her fabulous vocals . she 's got solid keyboards and vocals in support , so it 's not apparent until half way through the gig . but keyboards ca n't provide enough of an edge to the very few fast , upbeat songs and the whole concert lags . zzzzz by 2 / 3rds of the way through . look at the audience at the end of the concert when she plays a lethargic version of " i fell in love .

software pos 56.txt first , if you 're thinking about using these photos for print , you may wish to think again . most objects run between 300-600 pixels in width or height , or 1-2 inches at 300 dpi . stretch them bigger than that , and they 'll start to blur and / or get jagged . also note , that if you try to export / save an image from the hemera image browser and select the 300 dpi setting , the browser may stretch the graphic larger than it 's actual size , causing blurring and jaggedness right out of the gate . you need to use the " use image 's full size " checkbox when exporting images . if you specify a 300 dpi size , and do n't use that checkbox , you 'll get a stretched image . for example , the first image in the collection ( the pocket watch ) is only 384 pixels wide . if you specify 300 dpi and do n't check the " use image 's full size " box , the software will stretch it to 642 pixels wide . the stretching will cause the image to look fuzzier and / or more jagged when you use it in a web site or print project . all that said , if you 're going to use the images for the web , they 're great . you get almost all the images you 'd find in their three " photo objects " collections , each of which is much more expensive than this single collection . the difference is the photo objects collections offer about 20-30% higher resolution ( i.e. the first image in the collection is 384 pixels wide , but is 492 pixels wide in photo objects ) and you can save the photo objects images with transparent backgrounds ( while this collection forces you to specify a color for the background ) . for the price , this is a good collection . there are lots of shots with minor variations , so it may seem like duplication , but for someone trying to get something just right , that slightly different tilt of the head may be just what the doctor ordered

books pos 428.txt while previous guides for the serial drama " lost " have often left something to be desired , the book " finding lost : the unofficial guide " more than makes up for it . nikki stafford 's attention to detail ( and believe me , *all* " lost " fans should have a great attention to detail ) is thus far unparalleled in any other guide book . you name it , this guide book has it . in addition to the usual episode synopsis , stafford provides readers with all the information they can handle , including keeping track of the appearances of the " numbers " , discussing theories , pointing out bloopers and continuity errors , illuminating connections , and just generally proving that she has watched way more " lost " than any of us . in addition to all that , stafford gives the low-down on each of the " lost " cast members , before they became losties . even if you have watched each episode of " lost " 4 or 5 times , and think you have caught every little nuance and clue hidden within it , i guarentee you 'll read this book and discover things you did n't catch , or never thought of . one of my favorite features in this book is the essay that details and explains everything on the " invisible " map that locke briefly gets a glimpse of in season 2 during the episode " lock down " when the blast door comes down on top of his legs , and a black light switches on , illuminating the secret map . bottom line , this book is a must have for serious " lost " fans . it would also be a great aid to anybody who is just now beginning to get into " lost " .

dvd neg 512.txt sure , this was heaped with loads and loads of popular acclaim by the critics , but the question you should be asking yourself is , will it appeal to the average person ? the simple answer here is a loud and resounding no . here are the reasons : 1 ) unless you 're a well-bred blue blood who knows all about edward ii and loves shakespeare , this is extremely hard to follow , not just because of the archaic olde english-speake , but also due to choppy production and editing which impedes the plot coherence . result ? if you 're not lost you will soon will be , and worse yet , you wo n't care ; 2 ) do n't be fooled by the lure of annie lennox-she is an itsy-bit of a bit player in the overall run of this " movie " and is , for all intents and purposes , inappropriately placed in the middle of it much like the effect of having an mtv commercial rammed in the middle of your programme ; 3 ) let 's be clear about what you 're getting for your 10-15 dollars : it 's not a movie at all , but an arty-pretentious stab at cheap play production with less cinematography than your average soap opera or home movie . further , the " period " is thematically juxtiposed with costumes of old and new , making one more likely to ponder whether their budget was short , not what cutty-edgy-trendy-theme-within-a-theme are they trying to promote . who knew such a tantillizing , heart-wrenching piece of history could be rendered so dull ?
dvd pos 885.txt how did he have the time to write such a picture , to co-direct it , to act in it and after everything else to write its score ? noel coward 's energies , always remarkable , were redoubled during the second world war , and it must have seemed like another excuse to show off his patriotism , which he wore like a second skin despite his slummy upbringing . in which we serve is still worth watching , but it 's nowhere as appealing as either cavalcade or this happy breed , and its focus on the " life and death of a ship " ( the hms torrin ) is strangely monomaniacal , almost constructivist . over and over you see unattributed bare arms hammmering away , symbols of brute strength like something from a soviet film . the ship goes up . the ship goes down . a new ship rises out of the water . and in between coward tries his hardest to keep you interested in the lives of the men clinging to the lifeboat , till our interest settles on three- -bernard miles as hardy , with his striking , long , hatchet face and the deep voice that goes with it- -he should have played ichabod crane- -john mills as blake , a tiny little pipsqueak who 's feisty in the standard mickey rooney-jimmy cagney manner , and noel coward himself as captain kinross , tranquil with class privilege and , in the background , his glamorous marriage to the ineffable celia johnson ( so beautiful till she opens her mouth and those bits of teeth wobble around on her gums ) . hitchcok 's lifeboat had the same concentration on a handful of downed and wet actors playing nautical , but without coward 's complicated flashback structure . coward stalwarts joyce carey and kay walsh show up as the love interests for miles and mills respectively- -carey , in this movie and in brief encounter as well , treated very unusually for the 1940s as a woman not in her first youth , nor good-looking in any way , who 's given nevertheless a fullblooded and physical romantic interest . she must have kissed the ground every time noel coward walked on it . who else would have written such roles for her ? the movie is trying indeed when it goes " serious , " and yet that 's half the fun of it , seeing how often coward plays the " race " card- - " we are an island race " indeed . i teared up , of course i did , during the blitz as the v-1 rockets drop bomb after bomb on london households , leading to the death of several favorite characters , and again when coward leads his naval boys into dunkirk and out of it again with a panoply of half-nude british soldiers sipping tea or what looks like an enormous vat of kool-aid . outside of these scenes , however , the movie is marred by its agitprop and by david lean 's tiresomeness , in showing everything at such a glacial pace . ps , the film was shot by ronald neame who later became a director himself and whose " masterpiece , " the poseidon adventure , sometimes seems like a shot by shot remake of the disaster sequences of in which we serve

music neg 760.txt hate to say it , but this is pretty drab stuff . that said , i 'm hardly about to complain ; how could i ? this was obviously written for a film ( that i have no interest in seeing ) , and mogwai just released ' mr. beast ' , a solid ( if unspectacular ) album earlier this year . i kind of see ' zidane ' as a gift , then . looking at the whole thing from that perspective , it 's impossible to be letdown . but then , retaining much emotion out of this composition is downright difficult . mogwai , when channeling the right energies , create sublime , beautiful music - - truly as beautiful as any form of modern music , to my ears . when they 're a bit more ambiguous , though , the results tend to float in limbo and lack direction . ' zindane ' seems to possess certain elements of both these characteristics to an extent , but the result is surprisingly dull - - at best , it 's pretty ; at worst , it 's utterly monotonous . the ideas are here , too ; it 's not that ' zindane ' lacks drive or intent . it is a focused work . yet , it 's obvious , i think , that the music , contrary to most film scores , desires to refrain from emotional manipulation . while that 's admirable , i find that musically , i 'd much rather be manipulated than dazed ; this is literally music to listen to whilst on painkillers . there are a few nice themes and motifs , do n't get me wrong , but this is all underscore - - mogwai , in the best way possible , has a great gift at handling melodrama , and here they never appear to be guided by the dramatic light . i wo n't sway anyone from attempting to get ' zidane ' , but i would n't hand it out to anyone unexposed to mogwai in some hopes of garnishing their admiration . no , for that , i would naturally lead them to one of their many fine studio albums . for , mogwai is a band , after all - - they are not jerry goldsmith or ennio morricone . for those unaware , mogwai performed much of the score for the recently released film ' the fountain ' - - though they did not write any of the actual material , from what i 've gathered - - and as a musical experience , the soundtrack release for that album absolutely blows ' zidane ' out of the water . in my opinion , it even beats out ' mr. beast ' , so impatient fans who need a fresh dose of mogwai ' oughta check that one out for sure

books pos 803.txt peter balakian 's book , " black dog of fate , " tries to be too many things and sadly fails at many of them . in essence , it is an attempt to tell a sort of armenian-american story which i find not overly interesting or compelling . i wish the author had done a bit more in-depth work to learn about his people and their rich heritage before embarking to represent it or explain it or share it with non-armenians , for he has much more to absorb and understand himself first . i find the armenianness in this book to be tentative , unengaged and unconvincing . pity , since the author seems to have a lot of passion in his pursuit of other aspects of his life such as football , the yankees , modern poetry , and exposing turkish attempts to buy ( among others ) princeton professors to act as mouthpieces giving legitimacy to their vile historical revisionism , practiced by the " modern " turkish state and its organs . it seems to be all the rage these days to elevate personal histories and family testimonials into the realm of fiction and novels . the " i " and " we " and " us " occupy center stage and the reader is invited to enjoy the intimacy that must surely be in place via this artifice . but is it realy ? since in order to make this legitimate , the writer must distance himself , at least initially , from all this old world exotica , and like the reader , question their validity or relevance in present day north american society . what are all these old world , old fashioned ghosts and traditions ? , is the first cry of writer and reader alike , only , ofcourse , to be followed by a sharp bank turn where the writer steers the satisfied and in-place reader towards the opposite viewpoint wherein *this* culture and *this* lifestyle become suspect in light of some tentative spotting of cultural wealth that has been traded in or abandoned in order to swim swiftly towards materialistic , memory-free , self-redefining , " comfort " seeking and buying mores . in the balakian tale , one encounters suburbia instead of substance , worldly goods acquisition instead of deep roots that steady the soul , immediate family and relatives running away from their true identities either towards surrealism , the abstract and unemotional , or else towards medicine , respectability and detachment . young balakian observes but never understands " the grandmother " for she is shielded culturally from being able to reach him by her very offsprings who can not and will not instill the armenian identity he will eventually seek but never quite find . their crime is self-denial and a march to the tune of america 's mixmaster piper . " be unlike your past and your future will be brighter , " seems to be what america promises , at the very least . the intermediate generation listens and adopts this credo and peter is left to find out but never quite understand just what cost his ancestors have paid to remain armenian and to preserve our culture before the final denials on new jersey pateos while enjoying , as if to serve sweet irony , full course armenian meals and the mixing aromas of delicacies from the old country every sunday . peter is lost alright , but as the book sadly shows , he remains lost . paraphrasing or quoting ambassador morgenthau does not an armenian genocide expert make . personal family testimonials of the turkish atrocities does not a genocide history make ( for that , read vahakn dadrian 's " the history of the armenian genocide " berghahn books , 1995 ) . episodic accounts can be dismissed by the turks as hear-say and as mere isolated incidents , leading to more harm than good ( for if better evidence existed , the arguement goes , why would anyone resort to such flimsy fare ? ) . for the story to have worked , for the story to have *really* worked , as i would have liked it to , balakian 's life and lifestyle would have had to have changed significantly and his child rearing practices would have had to reflect it , and his relationship with his wife who , like him , is not leading a strongly armenian existence , would have had to have changed , solidifying his roots , celebrating his new found identity , and nurturing the metamorphosis by sustained community involvment and grass roots movement participation which , alas , never appear on the pages of this book . how else to explain the lack of a turning around of the tide of assimilation to which balakian is a grand personal witness , except that the transition has not occured ? the ship of armenianness sails by balakian . he is finally aware enough to be able to identify the ship and wave it goodbye and write about it , but not resolved enough to climb aboard . that is how the book fails and that is how his story fails . this is a story of assimilation and loss with a bit of mid stream self awareness thrown in . for a real story of an armenian finding his roots and letting them take root in his own life and future , read mark arax 's book , " in my father 's name ( simon & schuster , 1996 ) , " where the transition is real and the early youth of disaffection is replaced by a profound adoption of our essence revealed in exquisite frankness and power by mark arax . one can only hope that balakian 's partial reorientation towards our culture and traditions and essence will somehow continue and that some day he will wish to live with a more meaningful attachment to our cause and needs than merely as an able observer ( not withstanding his laudible actions as an april 24th - - armenian genocide commemoration speaker and an exposer of turkish infiltration in the us academic arena by buying spokesmen turned professors who mascarade as unbiased researchers ) . this criticism i direct to the predecessor of this genre of american armenian writing first and to balakian second . i speak here of " passage to ararat " by michael arlen ( hungry mind republication , 1996 ) where a disinterested soit-disant armenian goes to armenia in the 70 's and by the end of the short trip is somewhat more closely touched by this strange people 's woes and dreams . too little , too late , and always detached , is all i can say to these meagre displays of ethnic or cultural reorientation . much more needs to be absorbed before the essence is transmitted to future generations to take and behold . however , i remain hopeful that future transformatory stories and ethnic identity survival stories *will be* written which will show that the tide of assimilation and cultural abandonment are not the only outcome of this experiment of transplanting peoples and cultures to this continent we proudly call our home

dvd neg 994.txt they say all the major characters come back in ` stitch the movie , ' quickly made direct-to-video sequel to the hugely popular ` lilo and stitch . ' for me , the original film 's most appealing part is , and will be , lilo and stitch , one of the most delightful characters disney created in the last decade . do we still need pleakley when we have stitch ? how about cobra ? or some alien whose name you have forgotten ? do we need them ? no , i do n't think so . but ` stitch the movie ' crammed all these characters into this small film of which running time barely exceeds one hour , together with a weak story that repeats exactly what the original was doing . the original 's idea of ` ohana ' or ` family ' is changed to ` cousin ' this time , but for most of the viewers this is literally a twice-told story , no longer attractive enough . what makes us feel short-changed is , however , the lack of music and scenery , the impressive parts of ` lilo and stitch . ' instead of elvis songs , they have thrown in parodies or homage to other films and tvs like monty python and ed wood , completely missing the target audiences who would buy this dvd to experience the joyful sound and rhythm of this great singer . moreover , the charming , water-color hawaiian scenery is reduced to the generic , unimaginative backdrop which is barely ok even by the lower standard of the disney 's cheap sequels . the only saving grace is the presence of the actors who provided the voices to the characters . except that , and the funny but brief scenes about the lovely pair lilo and stitch , ` stitch the movie ' looks like a pilot film for the original . or perhaps it is .

dvd pos 713.txt first of all , let me tell you , this is not a date movie . this is the most brutal graphic rape movie i have ever seen , and also one that lingers in your mind long after it is over . for me , that 's exactly what i want when i see a movie , one that leaves a lasting impression no matter how difficult the impression might be . i loved this movie , because it is very very well made , and the acting performances are incredible . yes , the rapes are unforgiving in every respect , and the misery throughout the film is almost difficult to watch at times . this is not a gory movie , except for the last ten minutes , it is a very disturbing movie and it does have a fair amount of nudity , however it really needs to . " the untold story " and " ebola syndrome " offset much of the carnage with humor , but " red to kill " has absolutely nothing to smile about . it is totally and brutally serious from the first frame to the extremely nasty ending . the story is pretty simple , a psycho-rapist is on the loose and he 's going after a mentally retarded young dancer . in the second graphic rape of the movie he does the deed to the young lady . enter a female social worker who tries to help the victim , and dreams up a plan to get even with the rapist after he gets off in court because of a stupid technicality . her plan succeeds to a certain extent , but not like she planned it , and the rapist comes after her full force . the actor who plays the rapist is absolutely sensational , and i might add , the musical score is perfect . the music adds so much to the all ready existing tension from all the horrific acts . the actress who plays the retarded girl is also amazing , one of the best performances on film you will ever see . to end this , this is a must-see movie for fans of this genre , and i 'm just getting started myself . not the gore associated with the two previous cat iii movies i watched , but something even more terrible and unrelenting , and an uneasy feeling that will not leave you anytime soon after you see it .

music pos 725.txt i bought this cd before going to see mmw ( with john scofield ) for the first time at first avenue in minneapolis dec 7 , 2006. i had never heard of them before and liked the clip on the venue 's website . so i bought a ticket and wanted to get " out louder " , which i knew they were going to play , to familiarize myself , but the store i was at was out of it . so i bought " end of the world " instead . while some of it was a little too spacey for my liking at first , i still liked the overall funkiness of it all . then....i saw them play . you must see them play ! ! i did n't ever want it to end ! i immediately wanted to see them again ! it 's less than a week later and i have 2 more cd 's ( " out louder " and scofield 's " a-go-go " which they " back " him on ) and 4 more on the way from amazon as i 'm writing this . i 'm like an addict now ! i have to have them on in the car and in the house . i get back in the car after having been in a store or whatever and they 're on and all is right with my world again . i must say i like " out louder " and even " a-go-go " better than " end of the world " , but only slightly . it is trippy with the synth and the other guest players , and i do like it better after a few listens . i just prefer mmw with less guest musicians

music pos 183.txt goth meets cabaret , or rather gothic music influenced by cabaret . thats the best way to describe this wonderful little release by projekt . the eleven tracks here provide an introduction to the " dark cabaret " scene , and do so quite well . the first song , coin-operated boy by the dresden dolls , is a great start , and the cd continues onward to devious evil night together by jill tracy ( which sets up a wonderful film noir mood ) and on to the darker , electronic dance number cabaret fortune teller by audra , to a remix of knock three times on my coffin by projekt veterans black tape for a blue girl . along the way numerous other bands are covered . sam rosenthal 's side project revue noir makes their debut on this cd , with husky feminine vocals provided by nicki jaine , who also has a solo song ( pretty faces ) on the cd as well . personally , i loved revue noir and find nicki jaine 's voice to be quite alluring , but i also know some btfabg fans who dislike her vocals so you 've been warned . but all in all , i think anyone with a task for the dark should check out this cd . at the very least , its a cheap and decent introduction to a whole new style , and thats always a good thing

dvd neg 8.txt a 130-minute barrage of unrelieved bathos and sentimentality , this swedish import does n't so much insult your intelligence as complacently assume that you never had any in the first place , would n't know what to do with it if you did have it , and in general favor entertainment that bypasses the brain entirely and addresses itself directly to the tear ducts . the plot is of the type commonly described in laudatory reviews as " well-worn , " which seems to be a euphemism for " shop-worn , " " clichï¿½ , " or " stupefyingly unoriginal . " here it is ( spoilers follow ) : daniel , a big-shot conductor in emotional difficulties and poor health , returns to the quaint rural village of his childhood , takes over and revives the local church choir , heals himself and everyone else in sight with his life-affirming yet charmingly diffident zaniness , finds love , finds his inner child , and finally , at the moment of his and his choir 's greatest triumph , croaks . a great director and screenwriter might have been able to conjure some life out of even this forbiddingly stale and schmaltzy program , but kay pollack is n't up to it . instead , in a kind of perverse tour de force of misbegotten inventiveness , he celebrates , embraces , wallows in the schmaltz , throws it at you until it 's dripping off you like oobleck , and somehow keeps finding more reserves of it tucked away in odd little corners of the film . indeed , there 's something horrifyingly impressive about the way this movie gets relentlessly stupider and more bathetic from the first frame to the last : it almost bespeaks a kind of strange talent , albeit of the ed wood variety ; and while watching it i almost suspected a cynical provocation of some kind , as in the kingsley amis story about the poet who , at the end of a long and successful career , publishes a volume of intentional gibberish in order to expose the critical establishment as a passel of clueless poseurs . ( speaking of whom : " as it is in heaven " was nominated for best foreign film at the oscars in 2005 , after being strewn with similar honors in sweden , where it was reportedly seen by some two million viewers . we 're used to this kind of idiocy from the academy , but what 's going on in the country of strindberg and bergman ? has someone been putting something in the kï¿½ttbullar ? ) a standard feature of movies like this ( and books like this , if it comes to that- -cf . ayn rand ) is that characters are presented not as human beings but as representatives of some principle or other that the filmmaker deems important and relevant . aiiih is no exception . the parade of didactic marionettes includes : - - daniel 's love interest , a ditzy twenty-year-old blonde , who represents the life force ; - - the humorless , sexually repressed , hypocritical preacher , who represents the church , which as we all know is a sinister combine bent on stamping out the sex drive and repressing all manifestations of joy and spontaneity , especially in modern scandinavia ; - - the wife-beater whom everybody at first inexplicably tolerates , and then finally locks up and forgives- -who represents violence and what to do about it ; - - the retarded kid whom daniel insists on letting into the choir , chiefly so that he can become the film 's symbol of the virtues of inclusiveness and the deep human wisdom of special people . ( incidentally , it 's about time somebody realized that sentimentalizing retarded people , in movie after movie , as symbols of purity / goodness / wisdom-beyond-the-ken-of-those-cursed-with-normal-intelligence , or whatever , is just as disrespectful and exploitative as making cruel fun of them ; it just seems nicer . ca n't we have a movie that depicts a retarded person as a human being ? the only one i can recall seeing is " best boy , " a documentary about the life of a retarded man that came out about 25 years ago . apart from that they 've been reduced to targets of witless ridicule , as in " there 's something about mary , " or turned into plaster saints as here . ) so , to sum up : save your money and your time , which would be better spent sleeping or watching reruns of " the o.c. " run , do n't walk , from your local art theater if this is the main attraction . and do n't forget the moral of the story , rather comforting to me as an expatriate american living in a europe that preens itself on its superior wisdom and sophistication vis- ï¿½-vis the usa : kitsch is global .

books neg 631.txt unfortunately , for all the name brand that this book conveys , i think the cover seems to be the most intriguing part . there are much better ways for book peddling and the fact that a firm such as mckinsey allowed their name on the title of a book for the sake of a few sales , boggles this readers mind . the subject matter seems to be along the lines of the bull session with all bull and no session . no actual quantitative analysis is used throughout the book , and if anything more than an encyclopedic definition is learned from this book , i would be astounded . save some money and go search online for some basic books on beginning valuation . by the way , those giving 5 stars either ca n't read english very well or are shills for mckinsey

dvd neg 537.txt i find it almost incomprehensible in this more enlightened technological age that there are a very limited amount of your subscribers who are concerned about the appaling presentation of all but two of these movies and i also wonder as more and more older movies are being re-released enhanced for widescreen tvs that no one seems concerned that arguably the most classic of classical movie musicals remain in a truncated format that cannot be properly watched if one has a widescreen tv . these movies scream out for the widescreen , they were made with the ultimate technology of the time to be seen as wide and as broard as possible . yet they remain stuck in a non anamorphic style that limits their enjoyment to anyone with a widescreen tv and , with one exception , all the people who have written about them dont seem to care . " oklahoma " , " carousel " , " south pacific " and " king and i " need to be updated to 16.9 anamorphic widescreen ( also preferably with some genuine extras and commentaries as well ) . fox are years behind the rest of the movie studios in this regard and have only recently started to adapt their films for the format of the future ( ie observe the two versions of " an affair to remember " ) of course , this is a major rip off , so anyone with a widescreen tv who has not bought these films - -hold off , coz sooner or later they will get a proper release...how long ? that is anybody 's guess , but these postage stamp versions are an insult to anyone who knows anything of widscreen dvd technology ( " sound of music " is fine and " state fair " was made in non widescreen full screen format , an should be viewed with lines either side of the screen

" these guys were just the beneficiaries of rolling stone / elitist rock critic propaganda . ( and to think they made fun of prog bands for writing inane lyrics - - huh ! ) i think martin newell put it best when he called the band " dreadful bearded ghastliness . "
dvd pos 676.txt what can a single lie do ? that is the question that is examined in lillian hellman 's the children 's hour . martha ( shirley maclaine ) and karen ( audrey hepburn ) run a small boarding school in a small new england town . karen is engaged to a local doctor ( james garner ) . when karen punishes a malicious student , the little girl decides to get revenge . the way the girl does this is repeat a out of context statement made by martha 's aunt ( miriam hopkins ) . to complicate matters , she blackmails another girl ( veronica cartwright ) into confirming the story . this lie immediately destroys the martha and karen 's school . but their life 's are destroyed soon thereafter when their slander suit is rejected . but when the lie exposed it is too little too late . when the play opened in the late 50 's it was daring and very controversial . when the film opened in 1961 , it was still controversial . but 40 years later , it is not the lesbian story line that is interesting but how little has changed . hepburn gives her usual excellent performance and would have gotten an oscar nomination if she had n't made breakfast at tiffany 's that year . shirley maclaine was fresh off her success in the apartment and was ready to stretch her dramatic legs . she proved that she could handle drama just as well as comedy . but it would be 15 years for her to get another great dramatic role ( the turning point ) . fay bainter and miriam hopkins were major character actors in the 30 's and 40 's and were given one final chance to show what they had left . bainter received an oscar nomination for this film . william wyler had nothing to prove in the 60 's yet he continued to select great films with bite that featured women in strong roles . this was another triumph for him . dvd extras : none

books neg 233.txt i am a jew living in a college town in mississippi for the past 5 years . i was born & raised in the north . i think evans should rename his book " fiddler on the roof in the south " . his book is a very nostalgic look back at jewish history - as it was in the past here . it 's very much : the southern jews were all so happy , they all fit in and were accepted , etc. he does cite a few instances where they had problems - but these usually involved us ' yankee jews ' , like the instances when a few ( yankee ) rabbis in the south fought for civil rights . evans should realize that times have really changed here ! the evangelical christians in my town ( which is most people here ) harrass me like crazy - ' i am praying for you ! ' ' have you read the words of jesus , who was a jew like you ? ' ' when will you come to my church' . blah , blah , blah . thank god for the minority of catholics , methodists , presbyterians and a few others who live here . they are the only ones to accept me for the way i am , and the way i will stay - a jew . i want all who are reading this to realize that i am only speaking for my experience . jews who reside in cities in the south have told me that they have had far better experiences , and that they cannot relate to what i am saying . but i do want to ask evans a few questions : 1 ) if things are so great for the jews in the south : why have you lived in new york for decades now ? ? ? 2 ) why do n't you at least write either a new forward to the book , a magazine article , etc. , contrasting some of the ways in which the lives of jews in the south have changed over time ( for some of us at least ) , primarily due to the rise of the evangelical christians ? i read evans ' books before i moved here , and nothing much he describes in his books is my life here . for a jew who really cares about her / his religion living here is depressing ; it is practically jew-less ; and , at best , the majority of a certain denomination of christians here ignore me . ( by the way , i am planning to move to a city ! ) by the way , do n't bother writing to me to tell me that i am " wrong " , or to invite me to things like the bible study at your church . believe me , with all the praying for me that is going on in this town , and all the myriad attempts to convert me , if it has n't happened by now , as they say in these parts , it just ai n't gonna happen
dvd pos 619.txt this is my second favorite john woo movie with great touches of action and drama , when i first saw this film ( about 5 years ago ) i was n't used to seeing this much violence on screen ( and i thought lethal weapon was extremely violent at that time ) i was in shock and more then once my jaw dropped . this film is very violent but compared to other action films this is really tame nowadays . the minor points of this film would be some bad acting to some worse acting in some spots , some weird cuts and editing , the subs were terrible , as the same with the audio quality and some of the camera work is bad , but this is john woo 's first ( if you can count heroes shed no tears ) landmark heroic bloodshed film so we all know he could have done worse much worse . yun fat chow , ti lung and leslie chung have their good moments to bad moments , most of the good moments goes to chow and ti while leslie had only one or two moments . the plot is like this a cop must confront his criminal brother . that 's it . if your the typical hollywood action goer this is your perfect find . but as i said if your new to the heroic bloodshed films do n't make this your first one , i 'll say stick with the killer and hard boiled for a few weeks then move on . but if your the hollywood action movie goer make this your first if you can handle it move on to the other heroic bloodshed films and so on . this film is a big landmark in the action genre and a even bigger landmark to the underground action genre . i really recommend this film to any action fan ! ! ! !

software pos 73.txt if you decide to buy a current greeting card program , there are really only two front-line choices : art explosion greeting card factory ( currently version 5 ) or hallmark card studio ( currently 2006 ) . there are other programs available specifically for creating cards , but most of them are low quality and outdated , and are n't really worth considering . ( a competitive third product featuring american greetings designs is sadly now long outdated ; the designs in the american greetings program were of similar quality to those in the hallmark package ) . so how do these two products match up ? without a question , if you are looking for quality " canned " cards , the hallmark program wins . the hallmark designs are professional , and are equal in quality to cards you would purchase in a store . in contrast , the designs in art explosion are adequate but surely not up to the quality of a store-bought card . the hallmark program is also able to simply and correctly print to several different types of card store ( although you are stuck with the choices pre-programmed into the software unless you want much frustration ) . the art explosion does a poorer job of correctly and simply printing to a variety of card stock and configurations . art explosion beats the hallmark program in editing options ( more extensive ) , and in the amount of additional art ( clipart , etc. ) included with the package . if you do not plan to use the " canned " cards , then i would recommend art explosion . but the average user will likely appreciate the professional , high quality cards in the hallmark package . personally , i consider the choice of the hallmark package over art explosion a no brainer . a note on versions : the publisher comes out with a new version of the hallmark program every year ( 2003 , 2004 , 2005 , 2006 , etc. ) and the same is true for art explosion greeting card factory . having used many of these versions , i find very little reason to recommend upgrading year by year . disappointingly , the stock cards in the hallmark program do not seem to have changed appreciably in many years , and the same is true for art explosion .

books pos 693.txt alien invasion stories have been done to death since h.g. wells gave us the war of the worlds so it is extraordinarily difficult to come with a new slant to this time-honored genre . well , william c . dietz pulls it off with death day and the concluding volume earth rise . what sets death day apart from most of the invasion tradition is , first of all , the invading force being made up of different races . this makes an interesting dynamic and gives the enemy character as their squabbles , in-fighting and fight for freedom ( some are slaves to others ) make for something new , different and engaging . also , using racism amonst the aliens as well as the surviving human population rings a true , and tragic , note . the surviving pockets of humanity withdraw within themselves , close off their borders and horde resources . the aliens favor people of color and place them as overseers as human slaves are forced to work building alien temples on earth . and , sadly , collaborators work with the invading force to control the humans . but the seeds of rebellion have been planted . humans and enslaved aliens are fighting back and this first book sets up an alliance between the enslaved races . all this is interesting stuff and makes for a fresh approach . i enjoyed this book and recommend it highly . dietz is the best sf writer working today when it comes to letting character drive the story no matter the setting .

health pos 96.txt now that i 'm writing this review , it seems silly that i 'm so happy over such a small thing as a toothbrush . but i am . i bought this item not long after i had my first ( and hopefully only ) root canal and crown four years ago , something which i never again want to experience in my life ( as someone else described , it was painful and expensive ) . growing up , i did n't take care of my teeth like i should 've , so i 'm accustomed to always being told there 's either a cavity , or the start of one , and having to have more work done . after the root canal , my mom recommended a brush that had at least a certain number of pulsations / oscillations , because that 's what she 'd been recommended by her dentist to combat her receding gums . this specific item met those requirements , and it was affordable . when i first started using it , my gums were very sensitive to it , but that quickly wore off , so it seems to me that it strengthens the gums . it is also much easier to get behind the front teeth . subsequent dentist vists by my mom have shown that her gums have improved dramatically after using a high-quality electric toothbrush such as this one ( i honestly do n't remember if she has this exact model , but ours are similar ) , and i 've not needed any work done at the dentist beyond regular cleanings since i purchased it . as far as cleaning the unit to keep it from " gunking " up , i 'm the only person who uses this item , so any extra toothbrush heads are still in the package they came in , not dripping into the storage container ; so i do n't know how to combat that . but i just take the toothbrush head off the thing and rinse it , then rinse the hand-held part , and set them back on the unplugged charger / base ( i only plug it in when the battery runs low ) and things stay clean with no problem

camera neg 905.txt i spend hours pouring over reviews trying to decide which ultracompact was the best deal and the best overall camera . in the end , it came down to panasonic 's fx01 and cannon 's sd600. i read the warnings from other reviewers that the panasonic 's images were n't top quality , but i chose to ignore those reviewers because on paper the fx01 looks like it would out perform the sd600. i was wrong . after using the fx01 for a few days i knew what those other reviewers were talking about - grainy photo after grainy photo . i really really wanted this camera to be great , but it just wasn't . actually , my old 3mp camera took better shots then the 6mp fx01 ! very disappointing . i ended up returning this camera to amazon ( very easy-great service ) because of the poor image quality . i mean , wanting good photographs is why you take photos , right ? i know someone with the sd600 and he 's very happy with the quality . judging by the customer images on the sd600 's page on amazon , i think i should 've gone with cannon
music pos 823.txt bireli is not only one of the best living guitar players in gypsy jazz - he is also one of the most creative . on this album , he gives us a new take on django 's music that is simply stunning .

books pos 355.txt firstly , i have not seen the film adaptation of ' single white female ' and so this review is n't tainted one way or the other . this book , about the stolen identity of a young woman by her psychotic flatmate , is written is very easy style . characterizations , prose , and dialogue are all straightforward . i can understand why a film was made based on it since the book reads more like a screenplay than a novel . and the book 's " feel " is anything but original . ' sliver ' by ira levin does a better job of capturing the essence of life ( and danger ) in manhattan for a single , white female . still , ' single white female ' is an entertaining read . bottom line : a very enjoyable , suspenseful read that does n't tax the brain . recommended

dvd neg 936.txt wow , this was awful ! the best thing about this dvd is that it does n't last long . my boyfriend and i sat down to watch this together ( in the mood to begin with ) and both of us were completely turned off by it . the woman is not even naked , and wears a nightie throughout the dvd . she also is extremely hairy ( a matter of personal taste i know , but this was very extreme ) . the tone of it was decidedly unsexy , more of a strictly how-to than a way to excite the watcher ( s ) . it seemed to me to be very low-budget and unimaginative . spend your money on something else if you 're looking for sexual excitement. .
books neg 635.txt my blood was boiling as i read other customers ' rave reviews of " the prince of tides . " whoever considers this thesaurus-scrubbing , self-indulgent mess of cliches a literary masterpiece has no sense of language and literature . someone was even audacious enough to compare pat conroy to virginia woolf . what a joke ! woolf 's writing is brilliant , original , and real . she cuts to the quick , whereas conroy slathers his story in cloying metaphors and trite descriptions . one can almost see conroy congratulating himself on each simile and metaphor as he writes , not caring how superfluous or artificial his language is - - nor how unrealistic it makes the story . i laughed out loud at some of the words he puts in the characters ' mouths . in the real world , nobody is as self-concious and self-reflexive as the characters in this book . they do not speak in reams of figurative language . i cannot even get into how inconsistent and impossible the characters are , especially the children . also , conroy caricatures both places and exaggerates the cultural gulf between them . ( i make that claim as a southerner who lived in nyc for four years . ) it 's one of many , many flaws in this ridiculous book . read it if you like sensational stories with mass appeal ( john irving , etc. ) , but avoid it if you have any respect for the english language and for real american literature ( cheever , plath , hemingway , cather , etc. ) . do n't be fooled by all the fools out there .

health pos 337.txt having previously owned battery powered travel razors , i was always disappointed with their power and battery life . after all , what 's the point ditching a heavier charger and razor if you have to carry a load of extra batteries and still end up stubbly faced ? the braun 370-bk was a pleasant surprise , however ; powerful enough to hack through my hiking stubble and plenty of juice for an extended outing . i also liked the folding design which protects the cutting surfaces and keeps the cleaning brush from getting lost . a great piece of tech at a good price
health pos 3.txt i bought this gadget with the intent of monitoring my daily steps to get an idea of where i was currently to establish some sort of baseline so that i could get a reality check on my activity levels . i opened the box , read the easy directions , set up my personal step measurement ( just measure off the distance of your 10 steps ) , and clipped it on my pants and forgot about it for the day . i was surprised to find out that a corpse could probably move around more during the day than me ! over the next 6 days , ( this pedometer keeps track of 7 days of steps for you ) ; i literally stepped up my game and went from 756 steps with no aerobic exercise on day 1 , to 7 , 880 steps with 30 minutes of nonstop aerobic exercise on day 3 ! every day has been getting easier to achieve the 10 , 000 " normal " steps , and increasing the aerobic steps too ( which are tracked separately ) . i can press the mode button , check out how many miles my steps translate to , kilocalories burned , aerobic steps , and compare it with the past 7 days as well . it has turned out to be even more fun than what i originally bought it for . i actually feel better , and the fun part is that i am trying to beat my own personal record from the previous day ! this has been an eye-opening experience for me , and i keep this on or in my pocket all the time now , just to make sure i keep a mindful eye on my steps and aerobic activity for the day
music neg 704.txt inspiring ? no ! pleasant ? no ! entertaining ? no ! worthwhile ? no ! what are you folks sniffing out there anyway ? whatever it is , please consider passing it along , because other than the single authentic and melodic track by patsy cline ( i.e. , back in baby 's arms , which is available on a zillion other collections including some of her own ) , this cd does n't have an ounce of redeeming musical , lyrical or social value in my view . nada ! zip ! even the dylan track is junk ! the entire cd is essentially drivel , put to the dull , homicide-provoking sound of endless , droning noise , with an overall signal-to-noise ratio of about one ( 1.0 ) ! ! ! what a waste of an a-to-d converter
music pos 668.txt i felt compelled to write a review having read another written by someone who gave it one out of five stars . i felt it a grossly misleading and inaccurate review , so here i am.. . as a musician i could think of nothing more intimidating than attempting to cover a buckley song . their fan bases are fiercely loyal and protective of their material . so first things first i would like to congratulate the artists for their bravery . furthermore a quick glance down the list of performers will quell any suspicions that this is ' just another tribute record cashing in on someone else 's success ' , these are musicians that know what they 're doing . what struck me the most was the variety of voices on this disc ; you have the ethereal whisper of sufjan stevens , sweet folk harmonies of the magic numbers , the lazy drawl micah p . hinson . not only that , but these are great interpretations from the jeff & tim cannon . very inspired and innovative - a beautiful accordion riff on ' grace ' , an irish-jig inflected ' no man can find the war' ...these artists do not desire to replace jeff or tim , they 're merely reuniting us with what they left us - their music .

health pos 380.txt had i read these reviews before buying this , i probably would n't have purchased it . but i had been looking at the much more expensive sonicare toothbrushes after my dentist recommended sonicare after i asked . i did n't ask if there was a certain model that he recommended , so i assumed i 'd have to pay from $40- $150 for a sonicare . when i saw this one for $30 at target , i figured i did n't have much to lose . i 've had no problems with any of the other problems mentioned and have been happy with how it makes my teeth feel super clean and has even cleaned this spot that even my dental hygienist could n't get . it turns off automatically after 2 minutes , so i know that i 'm brushing my teeth longer . one thing that takes getting used to is not removing it while it 's going...you 'll splatter toothpaste all over yourself ! :d another plus is not having your tummy jiggle like it does with a manual toothbrush ! ! the only negative is that it goes thru 2 aa batteries about once a month , but the directions said that it lasts about 60 brushes per battery change and that 's about right . i 've started using rechargable batteries and have had no problems .
camera pos 165.txt when i bought this camera the sales people tried to get me to buy another battery . they said the one that came with it would only be good for about 20 minutes . now i have bought alot of items in my lifetime , a 20 min battery on a camera just doesnt seem like a very good " business " choice . so i said no . so i got the camera , charged the battery until the light went green ( which sucked because i wanted to play with it right when i got it ) and started taking pictures ( oh i also got a 2g cf ) worked great....so i planned to go up a mountain and take soem scenery shots . keeping in mind what the sales person had told me i pocketed the charger just incase . well , 6000 ' , 300 pictures , and 5 hours later the camera is still running strong , still have 200 shots left for the trip home , battery life indicator hasnt budged off of the full button . so all in all , i think the battery life is great , now i can see if your taking say thousands of pictures all in a row you may need another but for just going on a trip and shooting a few pictures at every stop point , the original will work fine . as for the quality of photos.....i love them

dvd neg 368.txt unlike many of the reviewers here , i 'm not a biblical expert and really do n't care if the movie adheres to the stories as they are portrayed in the bible . i would just judge the movie based on its entertainment value and ability to engage me emotionally . the biggest problem with this movie was that it simply seemed to be too long and drawn out . there were also some scenes that felt like padding and added nothing to the story ( and in some cases detracted from it ) . for instance , during the long voyage while the earth was covered by water , everyone goes a bit crazy . that 's an acceptable premise but it 's played out theatrically for far too long and in a variety of embarrassing scenes for the actors . the idea that they suffered madness was fine to introduce but it should n't have taken up so much time nor been quite so adbsurdly plotted out like a little play . there were also a couple of ridiculous encounters on the water ( between lot acting as a pirate and a merchant who sold them various trinkets for water ) which undermined the entire story of the great flood . everyone was supposed to have perished in the flood and it was a bit absurd that a few would be sailing the high seas on little boats . it was just plain silly and , again , seemed to be put in just to pad the story or add unnecessary " spice " ( it did n't work as a means of jazzing up the story ) . i 'm guessing the writers felt the time on the water had to be long to show how noah and his family suffered or had their faith tested but they also felt it had to be more interesting than just lounging on the boat and taking care of the animals . this type of insecurity with telling a story in the most effective way is what causes so many productions to go bad . to the movie 's credit , the actors are quite good and there are some good moments but too much of the movie does n't work .

camera pos 721.txt it 's pretty hard to argue against this at the prices we 're seeing.. . in short , for not so much more than the high end of the bridge cameras ( panasonic dmc-fz50 , fuji s9100 ) you can have this camera with the 2 kit lenses . i imagine that you 'll be very satisfied for paying the difference . 8mp with 2 pretty good kit lenses for under $650 as of 4 / 2007 , and an upgrade path to the e-510 for all the lenses and accessories . once you make that upgrade , what 's left to ask for except a faster burst mode and weather sealing . that 's 10mp , is in-body , sswf and live-view . imho , even if you 're an " entry-level " dslr user , spend the extra $400+ and get the faster 14-54mm f2.8-3.5 lens and get rid of the the 14-45mm f3.5-5.6 lens . the 40-150mm f3.5-4.5 is a very nice lens , with no real peers in the entry-level dslr range as a kit lens that i could see without going 3rd party . this lens put olympus over the edge for me . for that speed of lens over that 35mm equivalent range ( 28-300mm ) , i 'm not sure what else can compete on price . if you have to have a faster lens for the longer zoom , you could cough up the $800+ for the 50-200mm f2.8-3.5 , and even then , that 's a very , very good price for that kind of lens and 35mm equivalent range . the camera has full manual controls , as expected from a dslr , and can drive a newbie like me nuts , but can also keep it simple with it 's auto mode and numerous scene settings ( which i use a good deal ) . if you get this camera , imho , do n't bother with the xd cards . they are very slow in comparison to the less expensive cf cards in this camera . when it comes time to get a flash , go the extra mile and get the olympus fl-36 over the fl-20. i 'm not sure that the fl-50 's warranted at this price point . i was lucky to find one cheap , so i did n't have to research 3rd party flashes . i confess to having been a pixel-peeper and compared the high-iso samples from this camera to the canons and nikons of the world . it 's definitely not bad in direct comparison , but after you 're done resizing and touching up the photos , you 'll never notice , imho . on the down side , the raw files ( .orf ) do n't seem to be compressed , and they 're not exactly small at 14mb . all in all , not much to complain about here

books pos 47.txt i read the good doctor 's book eat to live and then bought china study which he talks a lot about in this book . then i bought this book being curious after reading a few other books on fasting and this book wins hands down though i do feel he 's being overly cautious about doing long fasts of more than 5 days without medical supervision to protect himself as people have been doing long fasts for centuries without medical supervision and doing just fine and since finding a doctor in even a large community is rare indeed one is left to do this on their own . being a vegetarian for more than 37 years i became an almost 100% vegan after reading eat to live and have to say that i feel great with more energy and even started reducing anti-depression med i 've been taking for severe depression . yesterday i took my last pill ! all week i 've been emptying my refrigerator in order to start my water fast tomorow . and reducing my one cup of coffee in the norning to none because i remember clerly that awful caffiene withdrawl healache , i 'm going to do 10 days and hoping for 14. i 've done 3 day fast before and one 5 day and that was great . yes , there are some flaws in both books and i wish the good doctor would have made use of a good editor as it 's not as professionally written as it could be and the recipes in eat to live are atrocious with too much canned foods and not healthy organic foods but i 'll forgive him because he got me on the china study which changed my life and his studies and own experience helping people get well are good and inspiring . why am i going on a 10 day detox water diet ? i read randall fitxgerald 's one hundred year lie and that was the catalyst that pulled it all together for me . a detox fast absolutely necessary after my years on earth and after too many years on anti-depressants i 'm keeping dr. fuhrman 's fasting book close by during the next 10 hopefully 14 days for support and encouragement . i did make the mistake of telling my coworkers that i was starting a 10 day fast though the good doctor warned me not to . the comments from them were typical i suppose knowing their health or lack of but i held my tongue . those comments are just like the stupid ones some of the reviewers of dr. fuhnman 's books make along with other nutrituion books . but i thinkof the wisest words , " you are responsible for your own health " and think about my not being able to remember the last time i had a cold and the last flu i had in 1964 and smile . i do n't intend to support the ill-begotten medical-pharmecutical industry . the last time i went to the dr. i promptly firedhim after his continued to badger me into getting manograms . and other tests , i repeated that i eat well etc and he said nutrition had nothing to to do with breast cancer and i just walked out of his office forever . i 'd rather read a book
books neg 70.txt i did n't know why i chose to read this book . anyway , it was disappointing , really . the book was slow , and it was too long for a story of its type . i mean , i think the book could go on without some of the parts . when i was reading it , i only thought of putting it down because it 's making me go crazy . i thought the plot was shallow , but taylor 's self-conflict was even shallower . he kept on blaming himself about his father 's death well then it 's really his fault ! he was a coward . if you do n't believe me , go on and read about it.. . although you might get bored getting to that part because it 's towards the end . and i hated it when this stupid conflict got in the way with his relationship with denise . he was acting really immature ! he should have at least thought about denise but he was too selfish . it really sucked . and yes , i know that this is supposed to be a romance novel.. . but i kept on looking for that love factor althroughout the book . and what did i find ? nothing . oh , what a waste . it 's like sparks tried very hard to make the situations in the story seem romantic but as a reader , it did n't really capture the whole essence of what romantic situations should be like . if it had n't been for my hrr ( home reading report ) i would n't have finished reading this at all . i guess i 'm saying this because i 'm not into this genre . love stories are fine but this one.. . nah

software neg 548.txt i bought taxcut this year because it was inexpensive and included business tax forms for my partnership . for the money i guess i 'm satisfied with the partnership results , but that 's where it ends . taxcut for federal taxes is not integrated with taxcut for business.. . ok so what do you want for cheap . but , it also is n't well integrated with the massachusetts state tax version , leaving me to go figure how to deal with what it calls " special " situations ( unreimbursed partner expenses and interest from out of state banks , for example ) . overriding form data is painful and the program complains that if i override calculated data i can not e-file ( not that i would trust it to e-file my taxes ) . form navigation is hopeless . i can only imagine what someone who is n't experienced with tax preparation could accomplish with this mess . i filed for an extension ; now i 'm probably going to buy turbotax to do the actual federal and state returns . with a deep discount , i would probably purchase taxcut again for the partnership taxes , because it is slightly easier to use than the excel spreadsheets i 'd been using ( but only because i do n't have to copy the numbers from the spreadsheets into the forms ) . honestly , you would think there would be some tax software that is better than the non-functional taxcut without the overblown , fatty and expensive too-many-talking-heads turbotax alternative
books neg 166.txt i wonder how long it will be before frost 's literary stock is devalued as much as it deserves to be . these are trite and banal poems that do not ring true or sincere . frost seems distant from both his poems and the reader . what he has to say is obvious and unoriginal . how he says it is on the level of a hallmark greeting card at its best ; at its worst , it is no better than a limerick . posthumous revelations about his horrific cruelty to others and his shrewd creation / manipulation of his celebrity image as the new england farmer-poet only confirm that there was something seriously wrong with this man and his poems that an earlier generation missed . how earlier generations could find genius in such obvious observations is astounding . bad poetry from a twisted man

software pos 506.txt tiger is simply the most advanced personal operational system on earth ! i am an advanced used . i have used all sorts of operational systems in the last decades : irix ( unix from silicon graphics ) , sunos ( unix from sun ) , linux , and also the bad written windows . everytime i used windoze in the last 20 years , i had to deal with crashes , hanging , lost of data and hours of configurations , tuning , adjusts , cleaning , etc. even today , everytime i shutdown windoze , it hangs , due to some program crashing . it 's a true joke ! ! ! on february 2005 i decided to buy a mac and give it a try . i bought a mac mini and started using it . what i have to say is that i am using it for more than an year without an issue , without a crash . system is solid as rock . some bad written programs eventually crash , but never the system . and i am the kind of guy who works with several heavy programs with heavy documents opened at the same time . mac never crashed . i am about to suggest apple a way to make it crash , so we can rest a little bit , instead of working all the time . so much trouble i had in the past with windoze that even today , while i am using the mac , i feel like it will crash at any time . fortunately it never crashed . beyond those functions advertised by apple , you will see that macos is a superb gold mine for those who want to explore under the hood . filled with thousands of powerfull unix commands and programs , you will be able to perform miracles . microsoft is copying everything it can from tiger and advertising it as revolutionary features of up comming windows ( hasta la ) vista . i cannot see a single revolutionary function on vista , as everything already exists on tiger . the most amazing is some sites on the web comparing vista ( a vaporware not yet launched ) with tiger ( an actual product ) . the only thing gates forgot is that one month after vista is released , apple will launch leopard that will take the crown from tiger . what i can say you is that for the first time on years i have joy of using a personal computer .

" ike took advantage of her . tina her self said she cared very much for him . cher even had seen what was going on and tried to convince tina to leave him . even the girls that danced with tina on stage had whitnessed what happened . tina did not write her autobiography to promote her career , she herself said that she did not want to talk about what happened but the public kept asking her what had went on . so she released her autobiography in 1986 , well after her come-back in 1984. while ike can try to deny it all he wants , the truth is he violently abused tina ! and considering the person ike turner is , i would expect him to do no less than to lie and make a pathetic-excusse of a come-back ! !
books pos 155.txt april of 1865 has been referred to as the month that saved america but april of 1861 may have been just as vital if not more so . it was during this time that washington dc sat completely surrounded by two states that were teetering on the verge of secession . once virginia did leave the union only maryland provided the federal government with a connection to the rest of the nation and it was a tenuous connection at best . abraham lincoln was clearly out of his league in this early stage of the game and he leaned heavily on general winfield scott . for his part , scott was keenly aware of the danger facing washington and began to immediately call for any militia units that could get to dc quickly from loyal northern states . the problem was that these militia units would have to travel through maryland , a slave state that might well consider these yankee troops to be invaders and could easily be pushed into the confederacy by such an affront to state sovereignty . it was also distinctly possible that these militia units might be attacked by not only the people of maryland but also ultimately by the state militia . in the meantime virginia forces had seized the federal armory at harper 's ferry and the gosport navy yard near hampton virginia . rumors are rampant in dc that the virginia militia that had taken harper 's ferry was preparing to move on washington and many in the federal city were in a state of panic . the questions that arise from this drama involve the decision making process on both sides and the ultimate question is of course whether washington dc was ever in any real danger . did the confederacy in fact lose it 's only real chance for ultimate victory during this time period ? david detzer has done an admirable job in this book of not only bringing this evolving drama to life but also of answering these questions in a clear and concise manner . this book reads much like a great historical drama and the author 's writing style is superbly readable . it is rare for the author of a history book to achieve such a sense of drama since the reader usually already knows the outcome . detzer has accomplished this however and although i was keenly aware of what was about to happen at every turn i had a tough time putting the book down . this invigorating writing style is often derisively referred to as popular history but detzer blows the sides off of that old mold by not only offering new information but also keen observations that cut directly to the heart of this eventful period of american history . no hero of american history is spared criticism when criticism is due and conversely even ben butler is praised when his actions merit it . this is the story of those fateful days of april and may of 1861 and it is a story that is well told by this supremely able author . this book is well researched , very well written and the story is told from the point of view of both governments as well as the lowliest private in the pennsylvania militia . it is a story upon which the fate of the united states once turned

dvd neg 723.txt i was surprised that so many people childishly attacked the person who gave this movie one-star . someone even accused them of not being young at heart . well , i do n't like this film , and i 'm young at heart ; i 'm just not immature , so try not to confuse the two . some of you need to check your spelling before accusing someone else of bad writing . having said that , on to the film : julie and friends are simply dying to be included in the in-crowd their first year of high school , so on the night julie has a sleepover , they make a deal with some rival girls to go on a " scavenger " hunt , which is basically one huge dare game . the group that fulfills the dares first get to be popular by.. . ( drumroll , please ) sitting at the popular lunch spot . that is , a picnic bench by the school fountain . that 's right ; popularity is not guaranteed by who you sit with , but where you sit . pick the right spot , and you may just magically become queen bee for the rest of the year . in case you could n't tell by my sarcasm , the shallow impracticality of this film truly bugs me at times . we all know the whole popularity thing is practically a tradition for teen chick-flicks , but this film tended to go over the top with a lot of it . granted , a lot of the exaggerated silliness worked for the film ; in fact , the movie 's beginning surprised me with many clever and well-written clips . however , there is such a thing as going too far . the movie becomes absolutely dedicated to making teen girls look like sassy but fashionably ingenuis bimbos and making teen boys look like...well , the dumbest , scruffiest beings that ever stumbled on the planet . not that all the boys are like this , mind you ; there are a few of the god-like types that the girls practically kill themselves for . it got worse , however , when the film attempted to fit in a few serious scenes . if the movie had stuck to pure sarcastic silliness the whole time , it might 've worked . instead , the few attempts to be serious usually fell flat on their faces because the seriousness went in the wrong direction . for example , there was the nauseating scene where poor beaten julie nearly gives up her scavenger hunt and one of her friends says , " julie , i know you can do this ; i believe in you " in a tone which implies that they 're talking about a major life crisis instead of a juvenile daredevil game . the worst " serious " scene , however , is when julie attempts to get into a dance ( therefore fulfilling the final dare ) and the ticket seller wo n't let her in because she does n't have a ticket . suddenly inspired , julie gives the ticket seller a sickening " i know who you are " speech , telling her that she knows she was a nerd her whole high school life and that now , because of her former nerdiness , she 's become a poor ticket seller . julie ends her speech by wailing , " i can see myself being you in four years if i do n't go to this dance ! " the ticket seller leaps to her feet but , instead of punching julie , suddenly breaks into a smile and says , " go ahead and go in ! " um , what ? ? whatever happened to the girls finding out that popularity is n't everything after all and actually getting lives and acting like humans ? ( not to mention that nice sock in the mouth i was hoping julie would get ) . is this what we want to teach our kids , that being dedicated to work makes them nerds and that partying all the time will get them somewhere in life ? i personally think the " nerds " are far better off than the girls who lose their virginity on the first date and party all year rather than learn anything . it was this scene and this message that seriously lowered the film in my opinion . i 'm not sure why the filmmakers decided to end the film with this childish message . maybe they did it on a dare because the popular filmmakers finally offered them a cool lunch spot in exchange . i recommend " never been kissed " and " mean girls " far more than this film ; they have good moral lessons as well as intelligent humor . oh , before i finish , here 's one more valuable lesson from this film : girls , if you want to win a guy who 's never noticed you , all you have to do is strike a cool pose , hop on a skateboard , and ride it directly in front of his car . ( do n't forget to wear an expensive dress and look flawless while you 're at it ) . do this , and he will be so in love with you that he wo n't even care if you tell him that you did something freakish like stealing his underwear . the things we learn from movies , huh ?

music neg 793.txt i bought guerolito after hearing " heaven hammer , " the remixed version of guero 's " missing .

software neg 274.txt yes , i love microsoft office . it 's incredibly user friendly , it has wonderful features , most of which i do n't even know how to use , and it 's spelling and grammar checking features are the best of it 's kind . i 've been fortunate enough to have been a student up to now in my life and therefore did not have to buy microsoft for my personal use , the school would always buy one for me . and of course there are always illegitimate means.. . but i 'm not advocating piracy here . however , i would be the last person on earth to consider using microsoft office if i had to pay $350 for it . it 's an insane price . consider the alternatives : open office : does everything ms office does , some things even better . i love how you do n't need to buy or install anything extra to type mathematical formulas in open office . the best thing about this , however , is that it 's free ! google docs and spreadsheets : this one is even better . not only is it free like everything else from google , you can collaborate in real time with anybody else on the internet to write your word documents ! nothing beats that , it 's just the most wonderful thing that google has done

books neg 236.txt i know that no book can cover every topic , but this book left a lot out . it went into great detail about what i should do if i got some pretty rare diseases , but barely touched on the subject of morning sickness , which is much more common . and some of the information was just plain wrong . i trashed the book when it made me freak out in the 20th week because i could n't feel the baby move . it advised that i should call the doctor . when i did , i found out most women do n't feel it move until 21 weeks . unfortunately i found this out after i had cried my eyes out thinking something was wrong . i would not suggest this book to anyone

camera pos 65.txt i bought the rebel xt w / the 18-55 lens exactly 18 hours before the xti was introduced , but that 's another story . as this is my first dslr , i was blown away by the results . but after the initial euphoria , there is always room for improvement . my first choice was the 28-200 , favoring the longer zoom over the is , but i found this one used at penn camera and got a deal on it and a 380ex flash , so the decision was made for me . i like the zoom range , it 's great for framng portraits . if i need wider angle , i still have the kit lens . i wo n't make the usual complaints about the herky-jerky zoom ring or the rackety extension tubes , as i was prepared for this by these reviews before i ever saw the lens . i 'm no expert on sharpness , and still trying to get myself dialed in , but my shots so far look pretty sharp to me . i have no " l " lenses to compare to , nor would i make the comparison if i did . in my somewhat uninformed opinion , this is a great step up from the kit lens . this is a lens a working guy can afford and most likely get great results with . being a working guy , i 'm extremely happy with it so far , and glad i made the purchase .

dvd pos 313.txt wow . that 's the only thing i can say after reading all sorts of negative reviews . i admit , the very first time i watched the grudge with my father neither of us thought the movie was scary at all and could n't understand its success , but after watching the movie a second time two months later by myself late at night i really began to see how frightening the movie is . probably contains the same amount of fear as the original exorcist , another movie that 's really effectively well done . you have to watch the exorcist and the grudge at night to get the proper effect . the grudge benefits greatly when it comes to maintaining a moody atmosphere and a pretty interesting story . i say " pretty interesting " because the storyline is n't the best , or the easiest to understand . just interesting enough to get the job done . the grudge also benefits when it comes to not giving away too much or too little . in fact , this is probably its strongest point . every time something scary happens , you see just a " little bit " of that scary monster boy or some kind of strange shadow effect , which is *very* important if you want to effectively scare someone . if the scary boy had appeared on screen for longer than a few seconds it would n't have scared me nearly as much because i would have gotten used to seeing it . the boy appears , and then he 's gone . not giving away too much really works with this movie . you see , to really scare me you simply ca n't put a scary monster on screen for long periods of time and you have to create a moody atmosphere to make the film believable . the grudge works *extremely* well it this area . the fact that something scary happens almost always unexpectedly in the grudge allows me to give the film another compliment . i 'm telling you , the scene with the woman inside that building by herself ( well , except for a security guard ) and having to travel home to an apartment building all by herself is about 10 minutes of total bone-chilling excitement . i *loved* this scene . i was totally on the edge of my seat wondering when the woman was finally going to have something bad happen to her . the scene where the woman saw darkness coming before walking down the stairs and having to hurry up to get out of there was *awesome* , and the scene a few moments after this happened where she did see something in the shadow was another awesome display of bone-chilling brilliance . there 's a bunch of scenes like this throughout the movie . freakin ' awesome ! excellent pacing and suspense makes the grudge a true horror classic , in my opinion . i 've seen a thousand horror movies in my time and i 'd easily put the grudge right up there as one of the best . people today have drastically different opinions when it comes to what makes a movie scary . remember the good old days when everyone could agree that the exorcist was the scariest movie of all-time ? i wish everyone agreed that the grudge is a total classic , and that the ring is another excellent one .
books pos 264.txt as with many of the " for dummies " series , controlling cholesterol is a well-executed overview of many issues relevant to cholesterol . author carol rinzler 's light and humorous discussion ranges from a concise description of what cholesterol is , to many of the different approaches to lowering cholesterol and why " target " values for cholesterol can differ in different people . there 's an especially helpful discussion on the effects of various popular diets like atkins ' , sugar busters , and protein power - - pluses and minuses of each . " ten cholesterol myths " in chapter 16 is a great discussion that can help clear up much of the murkiness surrounding cholesterol issues and can help answer many of the questions that i am asked when treating cholesterol in my patients ( in my cardiology practice ) . one criticism : like all books about cholesterol , controlling cholesterol for dummies gives the reader the impression that high cholesterol is the only way to identify risk for heart disease , as well as a means of diminishing risk of heart attack . this is patently untrue , but not really a criticism of this book as it is of the standard thinking on cholesterol . there are better ways ! nonetheless , this book does serve its intended purpose very well : educate the reader thoroughly on the conventional understanding of cholesterol .

camera pos 46.txt my all-around favorite lens in the canon eos system is the 50 / 1.4. i find that most of the time , most of the pictures i want to take can be achieved using hte 50mm focal length , and the fast aperture allows me to take photos in low light . i bought the 24-70 / 2.8 in hopes of getting high quality images from a zoom lens , as a lot of my pictures were n't in particularly dark places , and the flexibility to get a little wider or closer sounded appealing . i was not disappointed . the image quality produced by the 24-70 / 2.8 is outstanding . great color , great sharpness . it might not make images quite as striking as canon 's 135 / 2 lens , but they are very good indeed . does this lens replace the 50 / 1.4 ? no way . the 50 is a lot smaller , weighs a lot less , and is still much better for low light shooting . but for photographing events where you do n't want to lug around several prime lenses or go to extreme lenghts to frame the shot better , the 24-70 can be a great tool

software pos 703.txt i just used this program to make wills and healthcare directives for my wife and me . i have the book-cd version . i recommend it over just the cd , because it is a better financial deal , and you do not have to read a pdf online or print it out . here are some of the features that i thought were worth noting : * the program divides a document into sections and shows you a list of those sections , indicating which sections you have done . you can resume the interview at the beginning of any section and make changes from that point on . * after doing one will , you can go to the file menu and save for spouse . this creates a copy of the will with the spouses names interchanged . then you can go through the interview and make any needed changes . * in the process of answering the questions , the program accumulates the names of people you mention into an editable contact list . after you mention someone once , the next time you need them you can simply select them from a list . this is handy when doing the healthcare directive , which needs to show contact information , if you have already entered that information when doing the will . it is also handy if you decide to redo portions of either document . when working on one family member 's document , you can import contacts from another 's document . * the program does not appear to provide the option to list of two or more alternate executors to serve one at a time in the order named . the only way to list two or more alternate executors is to have two or more of them serve together . this is ironic , since the program recommends having only one executor at a time . although i wanted to name my wife , children , and then siblings as alternate executors , i decided to accept just having my wife and son as executor and alternate . if all of us die in an auto accident while taking a trip together , then there is hopefully time for the probate court to name an executor . it would just be more expedient to have one already named . * i contacted customer support asking them to enhance the program to add an option to list of two or more alternate executors to serve one at a time in the order named . the response stated why they chose to omit that option ( " the editors choose to limit the number of fields for beneficiaries and executors to prevent the program from becoming to unwieldy " ) and some options ( export the document and add the language or return the program ) . i was disappointed that they did not embrace my suggestion ( i disagreed that it would make the program too unwieldy , since they already allow you to list multiple beneficiaries and executors that serve together at the same time ) , but i liked that i received a prompt response that indicated they had read my note and knew what i was talking about , and that they gave an honest , direct answer . * at the end of the interview you can review the document as it will print . you can then print it directly to a printer , or export it as plain text or rtf . exporting to rtf is handy if you need to change the document ( they advise against changing it ) or print it somewhere else . however , the rtf is not identical to printing directly . i noticed two differences . ( 1 ) pagination can be different , and as explained by the program , getting the pagination right is important for legal reasons . ( 2 ) the footer is always different : the directly printed copy says how many total pages , whereas the rtf one does not . if you cannot print directly to a printer , i recommend printing to a pdf to maintain the pagination and other features . if you do not have a way to create a pdf , get a free pdf writer ( search on that term ) . when you print the document to pdf , print it as prepress so you embed the fonts .

camera neg 335.txt this is an alright camera . if you 're an average teen looking to post some hot pictures on myspace , or just someone looking to capture a few choice family moments , this camera should serve you fine . what i liked about it : 1. it 's compact , lightweight and easy enough to use 2. pictures taken in daylight turn out pretty nice 3. the battery life on this camera is much better than on other cameras i 've used what i disliked about it : 1. it 's a bit flimsy to be honest 2. attempting to take a picture in the afternoon , evening or early morning is near impossible without it looking completely washed out or too dark . even though it has a night landscape option , it does n't really work . 3. the flash causes a horrible delay ( but that 's been mentioned like 9 , 000 times before ) this is definitely not a camera for glamour shots . i 'd also strongly discourage buying it if you 're thinking of using it to take pictures at music events
health neg 698.txt i cannot agree with any person who gives this over 1 star . the main problem i had with this product was that it was far too overpowering in the fragrance department . i swear , it was like bathing in gatorade . and while i 'm sure that axe was going for that whole electrolyte thing in all its glory , but the smell is far too fragrant . and if you think that it has even the slightest bit of an invigorating quality , think again . i was a lot happier with snake peel
music neg 890.txt i am completly shocked at how high the scores for this album are on amazon . trust me , i am not someone who claims to be a music expert , but i am a big fan of jam / funk and jazz fusion . i play bass , i understand music , and umphrey 's is among my favorite bands ( others include 311 , widespread panic , deep banana blackout , red hot chili peppers , soulive , medeski martin wood ) . in general i am open to all kinds of funky music , and umphrey 's usually puts out . in my opinion , this band had the talent and unique sound to become the next generation of funk ( following the red hot chili peppers and 311 ) . with this album i was expecting them to develop their sound from anchor drops into an album that could achieve mainstream success like rhcp 's blood sex sugar magic did , while staying true to their unique roots in jazz , blues , rock and even some metal . like i said , they fuse genres like no one else can...this album , however , was a complete failure in the areas i have described above . first off , i can understand how reviewers point to the production quality , and the musical talent displayed throughout the album . umphreys mcgee is insanely talented , and no effort could hide that from the listener . however , to be blunt this album is boring as hell , has no funk or rock in it period , and is frankly somewhat depressing . if your expecting wild guitar improv , explosive beats and fun , uplifting music- -ignore this album . if you are a fan of umphrey 's live show and their past albums- -ignore this album . if you tend to be willing to overlook production quality in search of funkier , jazzier guitar rifs and bass experimentation- -do not buy this album . the only way i can summate this album is that its a typical indy type album . slow songs without enough music , little variance from song to song , depressing lyrics , and a slow pace . some say this is umphreys showing their full range , i say this is them bottling up their range in a more mainstream package that is not all that enjoyable . the only reason i wrote this review is that im amazed by the other reviews on this page . i wish i had never heard this album , it is a pathetic effort from a band as experimental and fun as umphreys mcgee . they missed a golden opportunity to come out with the next great funk compilation , this album is a step in the wrong direction . i strong advise the listener who likes to be entertained by music , rather than production quality and introspective lyrics , to steer way clear of this album . this was a massive dissappointment beyond any album release i have ever heard ( including by the way from rhcp , which is an achievement in musical creativity compared to safety in numbers )

dvd neg 547.txt i do n't consider myself a hardocre 50 cent fan , but i went out and bought this after getting a preview of it in an issue of xxl . it was n't all that entertaining . the documentary does n't really tell the people anything that we do n't already know . we 've seen all these videos before , but the video for & quot ; heat&quot ; is straight wack . the street version of that video is much better and somewhat funny . the show in detroit is n't entertaining at all unless you just get a kick out of 10 people on stage chanting the words right along with 50 while making it impossible to understand a word that 's being said . the sessions @ aol are straight pointless and why did we need an 8 mile dvd trailer ? the dvd borders on corny , but the cd is n't that bad . these are all songs that most diehard fans have already heard on his underground bootlegs , but i had not been able to find the & quot ; 8 mile road ( g unit remix ) & quot ; ever since i lost my underground cd . lloyd banks kills that track and that song is now contained on this cd / dvd release . if you 're a young buck fan , you should know that he 's nowhere to be found on this release . overall , the new breed is n't completely terrible , but it loses its novelty after one or two uses . the three songs on the cd are decent , but you probably have them already . i would only reccomend this to the die hard 50 cent / g unit fans

software neg 453.txt i am by no means a computer idiot , i audit computer systems security for a living . i have had to contact customer support ( webchat ) at least 3-4 times during the first 30 days of installing the software . the install was on a brand new system ( windows xp pro ) , with all of the microsoft patches and service packs and little to nothing else installed . first pest patrol would crash numerous times a day until technical support walked me through a complex workaround to prevent an active protection error window appearing over 100 times every 10 minutes ( which you had to click to clear each one ) . second , the firewall would tell me i was not authorized to visit certain webpages until technical support walked me through a complex process of deleting certain files created by the firewall and resetting the firewall after a process involving safe mode . third , pest patrol never would run a thorough scan . i 'd receive two separate errors that either said a fatal error occurred with the pest patrol gui , or that system resources was not available . i contacted the customer support and they told me that yes , sometimes pest patrol does n't work at all unless you use msconfig to disable all startup services ( systems.ini , etc ) reboot , run pest patrol , then use msconfig to enable the startup services . it was a canned reply during a live web session , which means that the operators were probably used to giving since it likely occurs to many people . i have n't tried out the third solution yet because i wanted to remind myself to write an amazon review . if you are looking for simplicity , or do n't know much about computers , look elsewhere . otherwise you will be in for one major headache trying to implement several technically involved workarounds . i 'll give it two stars , since it did n't cause my dog to choke , explode my house , or cause irreparable damage to clothing ( which is my one-star ) .
health neg 630.txt this is n't a bad dryer when it comes to convenience and travelling . however , the folding handle did eventually break and i had to modify it to hold it together . i have n't noticed any benefit from the ion control , mine and my wife 's hair get 's easily frizzled with this dryer , plus it takes a long time to dry in comparison to what others have claimed . the switch is definitely very difficult to use , there 's no way a person can use it with one hand . if you tried , you 'd end up dropping the thing . the fact that the off position is between the two speed settings is n't very good either because you push so hard to move the switch you simply move from high to low instead of to the off position . personally , i ca n't wait to find her a better one so i can tear this one apart for more interesting things . on the upside , after fixing the handle , it has worked without any real problems for 6 months
health neg 528.txt seriously , i do n't know how anyone can use this thing . i have had tatoos , waxing , and dental fillings , and i would rather have any and all of those before i ever try this product again . it feels like an electric shock and continuous pulling of duct tape on your skin . just awful . in the products defense , i do n't think there is a way to make this device easy to use and leg friendly ( god forbid you try it anywhere else , ladies ! ! ) . i was able to remove the hair from about 2 inches of my leg and i gave into the pain and went back to shaving . yikes
books neg 745.txt eliot cohen has an impressive background in policy work ( osd ) and academia ( naval war college and harvard ) . i had high hopes for this book because i thought his experience with the military combined with his academic work would produce a focused and well-grounded work . i was disappointed . i never really bought his argument that political leaders can lead war better than generals . he seemed to cherry pick leaders than fit his mold . i could not believe that someone who works so closely with the military would generalize military leadership in such a stereotypical way . the article might have made a good article in a foreign affairs journal , but the author seemed to fill out the book with a lot of interesting but not really relevant historical stories and facts . the lincoln chapter providing nothing that has not been stated numerous times in more detailed and focused work . the churchill chapter was the best . cohen obviously has extensively studied churchill . his sections on how the historical view of churchill have ebbed and flowed over the years was well done , thought not rally tied to the focus of the book . i learned the most from the ben-gurion , since i knew the least about him . the book may be useful to an undergraduate class studying political leadership or foreign policy , but beyond that the book unfortunately offers little that is new or of great interest .

software neg 382.txt i have uninstalled systemworks 2006 and will not be going back to symantec products . i had three problems : 1. on initial install of systemworks in january 2006 , the " goback " module wiped my hard drive . this was annoying and not easy to fix . 2. i reinstalled ( and had to reregister ) without the goback module and used the software for several months satisfactorily . a few annoyances : cleanup consistently ( every night ) deleted cookies and autofills i wanted to keep , so despite my entering them as exceptions in the options table , they kept disappearing . 3. i wanted to move to a faster hard drive . after following the norton ghost directions explicitly ( and getting a " successful " message , the cloned drive would not boot up . i therefore went back to my old drive . systemworks required me to reinstall ( and reregister ) . in december , after renewing my systemworks subscription for $49.95 , i successfully cloned the disk ( using ez gig ii ) . again , the only software that did not work on boot up was systemworks . i called customer support and was told that the server would not allow me to install on more than 3 computers . i explained the circumstances but was told " there was nothing to be done , " and that i would have to buy the software again . i chose not to . i have completely uninstalled the entire program and am now enjoying faster performance from the operating system and quicker boot times from word , photoshop , etc. the protections i was getting from systemworks are being covered by avg antivirus ( shareware ) , registry mechanic ( shareware ) , spybot ( shareware ) , and diskkeeper ( $30 ) , and microsoft 's malware guard ( free ) . i have been using norton / symantec products for over 15 years . never again

camera neg 116.txt this camera is incredibly frustrating . i must admit that under ideal lighting conditions outdoors on a moderate to fully sunny day , the camera takes wonderful pictures . however , photos using indooor and mixed lighting conditions leave alot to be desired . if you want to take any indoor pictures with natural light , this is not the camera for you . the reason being is that if the flash is not activated or the lighting is not perfect , the camera slows down the shutter speed considerably . since the camera does not have very good image stabilization ( if any ) indoor pictures are blurry unless you have the hands of a surgeon . of course you can use the flash , but then your subject will be overlit , while the background is pitch dark . and forget about taking long range pictures indoors ( i.e. at a graduation ceremony or wedding ) because if the flash is on , you will get a black picture because the camera does not compensate the shutter speed for distance , it only adjusts to whether or not it thinks the flash is on . if it is off , your picture will be blurred because the shutter stays open for 1-2 seconds . since i take alot of indoor pictures , this camera is worthless to me . if you only plan to take outdoor pictures in ideal light , this is the camera for you . if you want to do any natural light photography , forget it .

software pos 985.txt i started off using turbotax this year , but returned it to the store to use taxcut instead . i purchased this version because it was a bargain , and it 's easy enough to do state taxes by hand ( or for free on the state website for those states that have that option ) . i did have some difficulty with the update process , which was frustrating at first . however , i found taxcut 's website to be helpful on this point , and i determined that my firewall was the problem . i was able to update the product once i followed their instructions . one key difference between turbotax and taxcut was that taxcut is not integrated with as many companies . whereas i could automatically download my w-2 and most of my 1099 forms into turbotax , they needed to be manually entered with taxcut . this was n't a huge issue , but one difference people might want to know . i completed and e-filed multiple federal returns , which worked great , and the e-file charge was reasonable ( $15.95 ) . however , i do n't suggest having the e-file charge taken out of your refund . apparently , there 's an extra charge ( i think $25 ) for this service . it 's more efficient and less expensive to just pay the fee with a credit card . now to the software itself . i found it easy to navigate and enter information . i was a bit disappointed in the deduction section . many of the fields were too short for me to enter complete names and addresses of charities , which i found frustrating . however , the calculations were accurate . i checked taxcut 's calculations regarding amt , and they were excellent ( turbotax 's calculations were wrong ) . in the second return i completed , the taxpayer was eligible for eic , and taxcut accurately identified this and did the proper calculations here as well . overall , i was very satisfied with the product , and will use it again next year . i will make suggestions to taxcut , and hope they will improve their support for automatic download of forms and longer fields for charitable deductions . however , even without these changes , the product is an exceptional value
software neg 562.txt i have been a loyal fan of quicken for many years . my , things have changed for the worst at the once mighty intuit . it pains me to report that quicken deluxe 2007 is a work in progress . 1. the installation cd was unreadable . to intuit 's credit , i was given access to their download site for replacement software . 2. the reconciliation report ( needed for balancing your checkbook ) will not display or print for some reason . all other reports display and print just fine . unfortunately , the reconciliation report is the only one i am truely interested in printing . i am using a brother hl-5280dw laser printer . the printer works fine with all other programs , including the old version of quicken . again , the most important report ( reconciliation ) will not print on quicken deluxe 2007. 3. the software would not recognize the c-drive as a working drive even though the program is running on that drive ( ? ) - go figure . 4. the overseas tech support is willing to play dumb and pretend they do n't know there is a problem with the software , keeping you in the chat room for hours . i guess as long as they get paid it does n't matter whether they help or not . the ultimate recommendation is to reload the software - just one more time . as a past happy user of quicken 2004 , i was forced into this upgrade . do n't expect the problems to be resolved quickly . intuit has been aware of most of these problems for over 6 months . i hate to be the bearer of bad news , but this version of quicken is just that bad news

dvd neg 776.txt so what kind of movie is this from the director of " i know what you did last summer ? " it 's basically another installment of the same genre with a similar set-up and similar function . deep down , venom is just another teen slasher movie . they rode into this film with the same clichéd scares , a young group of teens , a psycho killer , and a traditional ending . so is it worth seeing ? that i ca n't completely answer for you . if you like more of the same old , then it 's probably going to be a blast . the filmmakers were smart enough to throw in a few thrilling moments among the mundane , overused plot . i found some parts to be slightly unpredictable , and they did a good job detailing some suspenseful moments near the third act of the film . the voodoo element allowed for some additional surprises and kept the killer from being simply " an unstoppable evil force . " but individually , do the separate factors of this film combine to make a masterpiece ? quite frankly , in my opinion at least....no . let 's take a look at some of them ; acting - well done , well directed too i might add . the acting is realistic to a degree , and brings us into the film . the actors responded ( for the most part ) realistically to the story line and i think that this was set-up nicely . the major issue here was the persistence in finding a gun when the killer is already dead , not to mention a demon child of voodoo hoodoo . lighting - dim , dark and mysterious ; the lighting definitely amplified the mood of this film . combined with the swamp-like location , i think that it sets a perfect example of what a good location combined with good lighting can do - make a relatively unattractive plot look beautiful . special effects - they set this up pretty well . a few scenes made me cringe and i felt that the artists working on the film definitely put their hearts into it...or bled them out for it . the gore was n't excessive , but just right for a slasher film , and props to the director for making that call . my only qualm with this is that they used the standard halloween " stage blood " which is just basically a thick bright red liquid that looks nothing like blood despite its color . a few of the actors squirm around in it , only to look like they 're rolling around in pizza sauce . there are a few other tacky special effects , including the last major one in the film . the killer - mr. jangles... . ? enough said...sounds like a dog . i 'll give the killer credit for being a good actor , but the portrayal needed a lot of work . the make-up kicked it up a notch , but the slow-motion style jumps and action-movie style stunts did n't do it justice . the man looked like an athlete and moved like one...not like a reincarnated being housing the souls of 13 evil spirits . although i do n't specifically know what that looks like....i 'm sure they do n't run like football players . so what overall ? it 's ok . not something i 'd be dying to see , and i 'm glad that i did n't run to the theatre to catch the first showing . it has some good moments and some bad , but does n't really stand out from any normal hollywood production . my recommendation ? it 's ok . i 'd rather go rent containment instead ; the first movie in a long time to completely blow my mind . it 's good to know that there is still some talent out there somewhere and that it still filters into the film world now and again.. .

dvd pos 291.txt there are n't many films from any era that come close to being " perfect " ( though that 's not really the right word ) in just about every way- -probably you could count them on your fingers and have some left over . " friendly persuasion " is one of those films- -in spades . directed by william wyler and starring gary cooper , dorothy mcguire , and tony perkins , it is a wonderful , human story about a loving family of quakers ( also known as friends ) living in one of the union-confederate " border " states at the time of the civil war in the 1860s . the cast , in small roles and large , is uniformly excellent , none calling attention to themselves but rather becoming their characters and making us understand them . led by beloved , legendary star gary cooper in a great performance as the head of the quaker family jess birdwell , they are marvelous , including child actor richard eyer as feisty " little jess " , scrapping with his big sister or partaking in a running feud with " samantha " , his mother eliza birdwell 's pet goose , who more than carries her end of the feud with scene-stealing craftiness . there are incidents of family humor and love and occasional disagreements , and a hilarious episode in which eldest son josh ( perkins ) accompanies father jess on a sales trip and is set upon by the scrappy , amorous daughters of one of jess 's customers ( marjorie main ) . we are settled into a lovely , lively exploration of the birdwell family 's idyllic existence . then the war intrudes . josh feels he must volunteer to fight as long as others have to , even though it is against the teachings of his faith . his younger sister loves a young union officer who is soon to go into battle . rebel troops are nearing the region where they live , and no one , including the audience , quite knows what will happen . there is a beautifully honest and dramatic sequence in which young josh gets his first taste of battle , which perkins performs with heartbreaking realism . i recall my father , a world war ii veteran , saying that this scene was the most realistic depiction of a young man 's first time in battle that he had ever seen in the movies . when it is all over and the birdwells return to their quiet , hard-working , loving life as a family , the music ( dimitri tiomkin 's marvelous score ) swells , the wonderful lyrics to the song " friendly persuasion " are sung sweetly by the young pat boone , and you realize you have spent two wonderful hours with these genuinely fine , completely human characters in ordinary life and in challenging times . the story has been told with integrity , honesty , humanity , gentle humor , kind restraint and , yes , love- -all of these also attributes of the birdwell family that we have come to know . that is the " genius " of this film . along with a very few others , it shows us who we are , who we can be , and how we can live , all with a grace and humility that is almost poetic . and the film never , ever loses its balance . it 's just a great and good movie . i 've seen it almost a dozen times , and it can still move me to tears . i 'm betting it could be released today , amid the ridiculously over-budgeted , badly executed films that rely too much on computer effects and star charisma , and that it would clean up at the box office . the term " family values " has been kicked around a lot lately , and nobody quite seems to know what is really meant by it . watch this truly beautiful film and you 'll get a pretty good idea of the genuine meaning of those words .

books pos 231.txt if you are familiar with the work of strobel , this book will continue to impress you . if you are not however , and would like to know where the author is coming from , i encourage you to read his previous works , " the case for christ " and " the case for faith " so that you might better understand strobel . some people have condemned this book because strobel does n't present the evolutionary side well . i have a few quick observations to make . first of all , he 's a journalist ; he asks tough questions and , for the most part , gets good responses . second , everyone has an agenda , without exception . strobel , and those who he interviews , analyze and break down the views of prominent evolutionists and modern darwinian scientific views . finally , it is clear from the outset that strobel wants to make a compelling case for id . this is not an unreasonable goal . the fact that he does n't interview evolutionists should n't bother anyone , based on his obvious objectives . if you want a book that allows evolutionists and designers to write you want to look into a point-counter point series book . if you want to understand the current id debate and would like to get a real good look at some of the cosmological evidence for a creator , this book is for you

dvd pos 364.txt i have owned a copy of this film for a long time . i have probably watched it ten times , and i always tear up a little at each viewing . from the beginning newsreel , of a shell-shocked diane feinstein announcing the less than hour old murders of harvey milk and mayor george moscone , to the final reel of harvey milk 's prophetic and haunting statements , the viewer is mesmerized . though harvey milk was a san francisco city supervisor , his election in the 1970 's , that of an open and unrepentant gay man , made national headlines . he was a ray of hope to gay people everywhere , who at that time were unrepresented and , for the most part , still forced into the closet . this film not only gives insight into the philosiphy of harvey milk , but is a rare document into that not so long ago but seemingly ancient time . milk was a very eloquent speaker , and his sensibility , logic , and unapologetic viewpoint more often than not made mincemeat of any verbal opponent . this is best displayed in the footage of his debate with then california senator briggs , a buffoon like character , who not only was a terrible speaker , who could n't even clearly express his arguably irrational fears , but who in fact seemed much prissier than his nemesis milk . the public view at that time was about family values , with the anita bryants condeming homosexuals to hell for their decadent ways ( old times come round again... . ) . milk 's voice opposed this view openly , and he seemed to predict his early demise at the hands of an assassin who was against what he represented . the notion of this martyrdom , and its romantic though fateful attraction to milk , has been argued . nevertheless , his bravery in representing the unrepresented cannot be argued , and the sordid details of his love affairs and personal life should not diminish his message , nor the admiration he deserves . this film unfolds as it happened , seeming like fiction , but all too real . as milk is assassinated , along with the mayor , by the homophobic and disgruntled resigned supervisor dan white , whose subsequent trial , with the famous " twinkie defense " , and his being sentenced to an appalling five years for the murders , resulted in riots the likes of which the city had never seen . as one of those interviewed here expresses with sad resignation , ... if only the mayor had been killed , white would have gotten life , but the fact that milk , a gay man , had also been killed , leaned public sympathy towards white , an absurd but all too realistic conclusion.there are many moving , telling , historically signifigant moments in this film , but none so clearly represents those times , and milk 's loss and legacy , as the film of the nighttime march in san francisco right after the murders . seas of people , holding candles and standing silently , came together in a very moving moment in time . this film , which won best documentary at that years oscars , transcends its subject matter , and is simply a great documentary . gay rights have made much progress . and perhaps time has diminished their names and these memories to most all , excluding those who were there , are old enough to remember , or are gay . nonetheless , harvey milk is a representive and icon of the early gay rights movement , and his legacy , through schools named after him , organizations , and his place in history as a voice for the all too often voiceless , lives on .

camera pos 143.txt for its time and price ( at the time ) , a fantastic camera . 6.3 mp is more than sufficient for most amateur and semi-pro ( non-studio ) work , and this camera works very well with what really matters : canon 's fantastic lenses . battery life on this camera is very good . the " shutter lag " ( between when you depress the button and when the camera actually takes a photo ) is fairly well non-existent , and the only real lag i have is when i am shooting multiple photos in raw format . as most photographers know , the lens is almost more important than the body , and outside of leica lenses , i do n't think anything really competes with canon 's line . the 18-55 lens that comes with this camera is sufficient for casual work...i used it at the beach , and on hikes with my dog , when i do n't want to lug around my bigger , more expensive , higher-quality lenses . but for $75 or so , you can have a 50mm 1.8 eos lens , which will supplement the 18-55 nicely , particularly for night photography . my one complaint about this camera is its ability to meter light adequately in dark settings . when i shoot raw this is n't such a big problem , because i can fix it in photoshop , but most everything i shoot inside , unless i manually mess with the white balance every time , has an orange tint that is interesting for the first 200 shots , and then is annoying after . i think the more advanced eos models that have come out since 2004 or so fix this color problem , and also help a bit with the lag between the raw shots...but for the money , this camera is excellent , and far , far superior to , for example , olympus ' digital exquivalent ( for a similar price ) . the difference , as far as i 'm concerned , is in the absolute advantage canon has in lens quality . you can use a high-end consumer body like this one , use a professional piece of canon glass ( lens ) and take excellent photos . i would n't invest in a system that does n't also boast excellent lens quality
dvd neg 605.txt equilibrium is a curate 's egg - its best parts are not good throughout , and its worst aspects make erratic appearances . the acting is really the least of its problems ; the cardinal failure was a script that could not decide what kind of movie it wanted to be when it grew up . equilibrium , however poorly , aspires to be a dystopian film , and there exists a dystopian formula at work in fiction and film alike . such a formula was employed magnificently in michael radford 's adaptation of george orwell 's 1984. contrarily , films imperil themselves in discarding the formula as evidenced by alfonso cuaron 's junky adaptation of p.d. james ' the children of men . there are essentially three parts to this formula . first , there must be a depiction of a believable society , and plausible justifications for its existence . the author or script writer must paint vividly , yet remain nuanced , since at this stage his purpose is to show the reader or viewer , without yet telling him the philosophy underlying it . second , two-thirds of the way through there must be a conversation between protagonist and antagonist , which formally unveils the ethical dilemma . here , the protagonist offers his alternative , usually an acknowledgement of the humane . third , the dystopian resolution lies in the protagonist 's choice : he must surrender to the system , rebel against it , or be conquered by it . the ending , if it is not tragic in the classical sense , must be ambiguous ; if it is ended happily , it is no longer a matter for the reader or viewers ' thoughts : the problem has been resolved , and he may retire from it and become forgetful of it . libria , the society depicted in equilibrium , is a post-apocalyptic society wherein feeling has been criminalized under the pretext that human feelings , and the actions carried out on their behalf , represent the fons et origio of man 's inhumanity to man . the objective of outlawing sentiments is the preservation of peace . is this believable ? ultimately , it is not because the viewer is given no other reason for this society to exist , no justification for its brutality except that it is by this method alone that peace may be preserved . however , a desire for peace is predicated on an aversion to war , and aversion is something we principally feel . a more believable premise would have been the prohibition of certain feelings , but it is also unbelievable because it is inconsistent . the protagonist ( john preston , a member of the grammaton cleric , an elite government agency for enforcing laws against so-called ` sense-crimes ' ) marries , begets children , hesitates in killing his partner - what point would there be in any of this in a society that had eliminated feeling ? and , if we are being generous , and suppose that this was done intentionally so as to say , " you can never entirely eliminate feeling , " it fails still ; because if the denizens of libria were n't completely devoid of feeling , they could n't be as cowed as they are depicted . instead , countless times throughout the film characters make comments , statements , enquiries that can only have as their possible source or response an emotion . to have had characters who were truly apathetic , or for whom the fictitious drug prozium was effective , they would have had more in common with star trek 's borg . the backdrop for this dystopia , then , lacks subtlety or nuance . from the first fifteen seconds of film , the viewer ethically objects - it remains tediously manichean throughout . the viewer is given a straw man and immediately begins tearing it down and the only suspense is literally in waiting for what we know will happen . in brave new world , it is mustapha mond 's conversation with john the savage . in 1984 , it is o'brien 's talk with winston smith . in the children of men , it is a debate between theo and the xan . in equilibrium , the formal unveiling of the ethical dilemma happens in a haphazard way throughout , culminating in a fight scene that lacks the awe inspired by the matrix three years before . here was the moment for the " talky " bit of the film , the sophisticated counter-punch , the moral awakening , the vindication of the human ; instead , the viewer is given another low-brow , hollywood denouement . john preston does nothing to justify his alternative to the totalitarian status quo - there is no bit of dialogue with father where lines are spoken which conveys the notion that " feelings are essential to thought , " or that " peace has been obtained at a terrible price . " all the loose ends , littered liberally throughout the film , are never addressed : why have art in libria ? why does father intonate , and raise the pitch of his voice to manipulate the masses in a scene reminiscent of a leni riefenstahl propaganda film ? a better film would have acknowledged these scenes , and defended their inclusion in a climatic dialogue between john preston and father ( or dupont as it turns out ) . the conclusion of equilibrium can be summarized as follows : " good guy kills bad guys , sixty-second revolution ensues , people can feel again , hero smiles , time to go to bed . " there was n't ever a genuine ethical dilemma anyway : what was wrong was obviously wrong , and what was right was intuitively right . the viewer never believed the reasons libria came to be , or at least they never found them plausible in the way they found huxley 's , orwell 's , james ' , zamyatin 's , or koestler 's explanations . in equilibrium it was all simply the soft groundwork prepared for the banal , unoriginal action movie to follow . the plot , then , was in some respects as shallow as the tendentious storylines in soft-core porn films : they need n't be sensical because no one is interested in the story , but rather for the titillation , arousal , and amusement . many viewers of equilibrium are fans of flashy action sequences ( a majority of whom were not disappointed as their reviews attest ) ; but for those seeking a fuller cinematic experience , equilibrium is an unfortunate disappointment . during the film a woman asks preston , " why are you alive ? " preston responds with the bureaucratically sterile answer , " i 'm alive to safeguard the continuity of this great society . to serve libria . " " it 's circular . you exist to continue your existence . what 's the point ? " she asks . and , what 's the point is exactly the point about this film .

camera neg 966.txt as an owner of the sony dcr-hc30 model dv handicam , i want to warn everyone about my horrible experience with this product line . design and feature-wise , these handicams are great . the problem is , they are built like junk . from the day i opened my box , i got a message that told me that the heads were dirty and needed to be cleaned . in retrospect , i should have returned it for a replacement then and there . but being a basically optimistic guy , i decided it just got dirty in transit , and i got a head cleaner and cleaned the heads . it worked fine for about 30 days - just about the amount of time in sony 's crappy labor warranty . and from that point forward , i have gotten dirty head messages constantly , which at first could be ` cleaned away , ' but now , even when the message is gone , problems persist . i often get bars across the screen during playback , and i have already determined that i have lost many a precious memory of my infant children . sony 's solution to this situation is their standard " flat rate " repair program , truly a bargain for $250 or so - more than half what i paid for the camera in the first place . and sony wonders why their brand value has all but disappeared ? they are just another electronics brand now , and one with sub-par quality and service at that . guess i 'll be buying samsungs or canons next time around . are you listening , sony ?

camera neg 946.txt i spend hours pouring over reviews trying to decide which ultracompact was the best deal and the best overall camera . in the end , it came down to panasonic 's fx01 and cannon 's sd600. i read the warnings from other reviewers that the panasonic 's images were n't top quality , but i chose to ignore those reviewers because on paper the fx01 looks like it would out perform the sd600. i was wrong . after using the fx01 for a few days i knew what those other reviewers were talking about - grainy photo after grainy photo . i really really wanted this camera to be great , but it just wasn't . actually , my old 3mp camera took better shots then the 6mp fx01 ! very disappointing . i ended up returning this camera to amazon ( very easy-great service ) because of the poor image quality . i mean , wanting good photographs is why you take photos , right ? i know someone with the sd600 and he 's very happy with the quality . judging by the customer images on the sd600 's page on amazon , i think i should 've gone with cannon

dvd neg 975.txt ahh , " iron eagle " . a classic of the 1980 's golan-globus production mill . with the current spate of historic / " current " military movies , it 's sometimes good to see how hollywood 's come in trying to get the details right . one ca n't do much better than using this flick as a baseline . in case you are n't already familiar with this gem , louis gosset jr. playing a reserve air force colonel , and a teenage kid fly a mission inside an unnamed arab country -ok i 'll name it : libya - to rescue the kid 's dad . pop gets shot-down when he 's intercepted in international waters , but the us refuses to do anything more than diplomatic pressure . the kid and lou gosset meet up when the kid 's challenged to race the local bully with his plane while the bully 's using his dirt bike . suffice it to say he wins and impresses his babe ; he does n't get his slot at the usaf academy , though . you gotta take the bad with good i guess . when the words on dad get back to the family , this kid uses his base " network " to get access to imagery , enemy air defense data , and two f16s carrying a b52 's worth of ordinance . all of this being done by his friends exploiting the dim bulbs who are their parents , no less . ( if only strike planning was this easy . ) of course , the kid has flown training missions with his dad , and has a boatload of simulator time , so he 's a natural to fly the mission . he convinces gosset to go along with him , and his two-ship is on the way . the flying scenes are nothing spectacular , with obviously israeli f16s playing the good guys , and kfirs ( modified mirages ) acting as migs . cockpit scenes are completely the imagination of the set designer ; i 'm guessing he never was anywhere near a real aircraft . these are especially dated now as many computer flight sims are pretty darn accurate in cockpit , flight , and combat models . anyway , lots of explosions on the way in , lou gets hit and aborts and our hero must press on alone-go figure . he manages to talk with the evil dictator directly and get his dad on the runway for him to land ( ! ) and pick him up . more silliness ensues as he launches weapons on the ground , taxi 's out and takesoff . he kills the bad guy and heads home to find lou punched out and was rescued . rather than the prison sentence for espionage , and theft of government property that lou , the kid , his pals and the idiots they exploited on base should 've got , he gets his slot at the air force academy . the end . overall , i guess lou 's performance was fairly good , but everyone else performed at the grade-b level this flick is . note especially a very young shawnee smith as one of the kid 's buds . worth seeing for laughs , and as a film version of a kid 's pilot fantasy .

software pos 329.txt nero 7 the original version was useless in that it prevented you from burning some things ; mysteriously nero had suddenly undone itself . all of that has now changed with the new update . it is so good that you can now burn anything on vista . nero inc also released a " nero 7 cleantool " for removing bad installs . if you have had trouble with nero 7 on vista then the cleantool will fix it . apply the tool . clean install . nero 7 is 99.9% effective but has a tendency to corrupt now again simply because it has a vast configuration system . nero is a core burning tool . this means that several backup packages out there will actually find nero on install and use it for burning . one example is dvdshrink that runs nero in the background while backing up dvd movies on dvd-r . i / o errors with these programs , including dvd decrypter , are usually the result of a configuration problem with nero . one example is updating your firmware . sometimes this requires you to reinstall nero . this problem however is the only bug i have found with nero . just on the side - i highly recommend either sony , imation , memorex , verbatim as relatively cheap good second class media ( 80% or higher burn success rate ) . dvd is still in its early days of development and some media is garbage so do n't blame nero if you make coasters ( half burned dvd-r discs that are useless to you ) with this software . i also recommend a healthy supply of at least 3 dvd-rw discs for testing your burning so that you never make a coaster and waste money . okay , now back to nero . nero burning rom is the real tool in the bundle . it is the most configurable burning tool in the package while nero express is for those who do not know a thing about burning and works like a wizard . a word of advice is to stick with the rom and learn it without using the wizard . you can choose from dozens of cd formats and dozens dvd formats , including several variations of each format . image burning and hybrid discs of any time are all here . there is not a disc format you cannot burn with this program . burner hardware based error correction systems in conjunction with the nero software make a perfect burn almost every time . nero also happens to be extremely fast , if not the fastest out there , however fast is also in terms of how fast your burner is , but the software package requires little to no processing before a 8gb dvd is being pulled onto your hd . you can create isos with nero and even use nero to open up isos so you can read the content ) . there is an amazing amount of free software out there that uses this burner as their base and rightly so . it is the best burning software out there at this time of writing . pros : - if you can learn tutorials for all types of backups then this and a dvd burner will change your life if you play games and watch movies . - solid performance . with good hardware and media almost flawless burns every time . - nice configuration . can even backup your ps and xbox games . - all burning formats . - about 266mb in size . cons : - let 's face it . dvd burning and backup does have a bit of a learning curve . read plenty of tutorials that use nero to do specific backups . - corrupts sometimes and needs cleaning before reinstall . - you really need a top of the range machine to backup a dvd in less than an hour
dvd neg 778.txt when we watched this remake of brian 's song , it was not by design . we had requested the 1971 version from netflix , but the dvd was damaged in the mail and they resent the 2001 remake by mistake . but instead of sending it back again , we thought " what the hec , let 's give it a chance . " while we did n't expect it to live up to the beloved original , nothing could prepare us for how god-awful it was . so when we saw all the stars given to this remake , we were utterly mystified . other than mekhi phifer 's performance , which was pretty good , it was a joke . sean 's maher 's brian piccolo was a caricature ; cartoony and over-the-top obnoxious . maybe they had intended to cast jim carrey in the role but he was busy . instead , they got maher to do a jim carrey impersonation . james caan portrayed piccolo as this outgoing , wise-cracking guy , but he was human and believable - - not a clown . and those football scenes . they looked ridiculous . at least in the original they used real game footage , which gave a real gritty sense of being in a stadium - - not at a high school or some sound stage . even though the original was a tv movie , the performances , scenarios and dialog were well done , believable , touching , heartwrenching . if you watch it now is it dated ? of course , but there 's nothing wrong with that . it is current to the time it depicts . but this remake reminds us of a very bad , melodramatic after-school special . really , it was so bad i ca n't find adequate words to describe it

dvd pos 87.txt the royal tenenbaums is wes anderson 's third major motion picture . the movie revolves around a rich , but extremely eccentric man name royal tenenbaum ( gene hackman ) . royal and his wife etheline ( angelica huston ) had three children : chas ( ben stiller ) , margot ( gwyneth paltrow ) , and richie ( luke wilson ) . in the 1970s the tenenbaums were one of america 's premier families : margot was a famous playwright , richie was a junior tennis champion who later won three consecutive u.s. nationals , and chas started his first real estate business at an early age earning himself his first million dollars before he was thirteen . that was almost thirty years ago and the tenenbaums have largely been forgotten . betrayal , failure , and disaster have haunted the family and the laurels of their youthful days have withered and died . what 's worse is that royal 's children and wife blame him for all their failures . royal senses that his time is earth is waning and he wishes to set things right . with the assistance of his faithful servant and lifelong friend , pagoda ( kumar pallana ) , royal sets into motion a plan to redeem himself in his family 's eyes . i 'm a pretty big fan of wes anderson and have seen all four of his films . the royal tenenbaums is anderson 's most critically acclaimed and his most popular picture . however , it is my least favorite of his movies . like all anderson films the movie is filled with quirky characters and witty dialogue . the film is about the redemption of a man in the eyes of his family , a theme that i enjoy . yet , the film just did n't resonate with me as much as anderson 's other pictures . i really do n't know why that is . that 's not to say the royal tenenbaums is a bad movie because it 's not . in addition to everything else mention it also has some good acting , brilliant set designs , etc. i just prefer a movie about thieve brothers or a film about a precocious teenage genius or comic-drama about a sea-voyaging documentarian instead

dvd neg 506.txt i live in colorado , one of the states that receives emergency funding because the illegal alien situation has gotten so out of hand . this movie is about a town called farmingville and the disruptions in their lives as they ( literally ) wake up to find mass groups of illegals outside of their neighborhoods . some live 20 to a house and have cars coming and going every day - ( imagine how that would bring down the resale value on a home ? ) the aliens surround the streets to hustle for work right out in the open . the video documents the two sides ( the ones who support , and oppose ) the situation . the side that opposes the intrusion into their lives painfully reveals their exasperation at their own city 's inability to instill order and law . as women who go to the neighborhood 7 / 11 are whistled at , they become nervous ( as a women offered in the video-unfortunetly it was not shown ) . the thick misogyny in the mexican aliens was especially disturbing ( example : a women who was with a special interest gruop to offer services to the illegal men was unsure whether they would listen to her , as in the mexican culture ) . some create groups in support , others create and claw for order . eventually a town meeting is called in which one of the women who runs the opposing group is called a rascist by her own politicians as he is flanked by two illegal aliens who nod in agreement . it is especially poignant to watch as this everday american women brings the situation to her counsil members . they call her a rascist , and many of the illegal aliens surround this politician in support.it was disturbing to see a foreign lawbreaker have more influence over our politicians than one law-abiding women and her attempts at trying to instill order in her own town . i do n't believe it portrayed the opposing townspeoples side very fairly . they had every right to be exasperated-our we not in a terror war ? since when does mexicos problems come before our own ? maybe because it was made by carlos sandaval it was more unobjective . i felt the film more unfairly depicted the opposing ( against illegal immigrants ) as ' mean ' rather than literally mindblown and aggravated their laws were n't being enforced ! when does the nations people not have a voice in their own country ?

books neg 396.txt " ...minus several million for good thinking.. . " - zaphod beeblebrox , the hitchhiker 's guide to the galaxy the above quote ( and the score i 've assigned to this book ) are n't in reference to the text or the author , but to the publishers . why anyone with the brains of a sea urchin would cross professor hawking as they seem to have done is beyond me . briefly , save your money and buy the illustrated brief history of time instead of the theory of everything , even if you 're a compulsive hawking completist . alert readers should notice that hawking does n't hold the copyright for theory of everything , and attempted to block its publication . it was originally titled the cambridge lectures : life works , and appears to have been drawn from some recordings of lectures given by the professor years ago . ( see the professor 's web site for details . ) the " vanilla " ( i.e. , not the illustrated ) theory of everything consists of an introduction , seven lectures , and an index , without *any* illustrations or diagrams . out of curiosity , i compared a library copy of it with the illustrated brief history of time . unless otherwise noted , each of the 7 lectures corresponds to a chapter of the same name in brief history , in some segments only with slightly different paragraphing and punctuation ( and occasionally the kind of spelling errors that creep in when one transcribes audio narration to text , if i may speculate as to the cause ) . i do n't understand why anyone would prefer the less polished text of theory of everything to the illustrated brief history of time , which not only has updates for new areas of research , but has been revised and rearranged to explain things more gently to the layperson . " ideas about the universe " is essentially an extract from " our picture of the universe " , the first chapter of brief history , with about one sentence 's worth of drift per paragraph . brief history 's version of " the expanding universe " has a more gradual introduction to the methods of measuring distances to nearby stars , and explains technical terms that may be unfamiliar to the non-scientist , such as luminosity . theory of everything really shows its age in " black holes " when compared to brief history , as hawking has not been idle in that area over the years . the illustrated edition of brief history has had a fair bit of interesting material added to " black holes " , especially regarding cosmic censorship and naked singularities ( hawking having made a few *more* bets on the subject with preskill and thorne , although he paid off the cygnus x-1 wager ) . " black holes ai n't so black " lacks major blocks of clarification / explanation added by hawking to the version in brief history . brief history 's version of " the origin and fate of the universe " goes into more detail : about the kinds of particles that are predicted to have come out of the big bang , and what sort of results we 'd expect to see today if the predictions hold , and the scientists who first put forward these theories . brief history also contains a much longer version of the " open questions " section , leading more gradually up to the discussion of guth 's development of the inflationary model . " the direction of time " corresponds to brief history 's " the arrow of time " ( which is worth picking up just for the picture of the keeper of the u.s. cesium clock ) . brief history goes into more detailed examples to explain what hawking means by the psychological arrow of time , with the simplest kind of " computer " : an abacus . " the theory of everything " mainly corresponds to brief history 's more modestly titled " the unification of physics " , which is much more up to date ( string theories are still covered , but a lot more work has been done in that area over the years ) . the tail end of the lecture corresponds to the ending of brief history 's " conclusion " . - - in summary , this is interesting stuff , but the illustrated brief history of time does it better

camera pos 720.txt this is a camcorder for the digital age . tiny , multi-functional , and flexible . no ancient-technology magnetic tape . as with any product on the leading edge , there are many shortcomings . let 's dispense with the obvious . this device is all about compact go-anywhere flexibility and ease . for best image quality , a dedicated mini-dv camcorder and dedicated digital still camera is the only way to go . in fact , buying a separate camcorder and still camera may likely be less expensive than the sanyo c6 while resulting in superior quality . overall image quality is best described as " ok " . the poor lens zoom and aperture is more befitting a $100 digital camera than a $400 device . the flash is weak and will not light many scenes that any other still camera would light . in addition , since the flash is not offset in any way from the lens , red-eye is virtually guaranteed at any range . this is not a problem with digital touch-up being common practice , but plan on touching up more often . low light conditions drag down image quality dramatically in video mode . virtually any digital camcorder at any price will outperform this sanyo in video mode in any situation , but a little day light goes a long way towards improving video quality with the xacti c6. also , to be clear , the video quality is still superior to anything seen in the best of analog camcorders . for all these negatives , the convenience can be truly revolutionary . one can wear the tiny vpc-c6 around the neck all day . this causes an amazing change in attitude towards video . since the sanyo is so compact , no one would think twice about bringing it along on any minor travel . being freed from the chore of " packing up " a camcorder means a corresponding willingness to bring the sanyo on so many more occasions , such as a visit to the park instead of just weddings and birthday parties . and whereas a mini-dv camcorder requires one hour to transfer one hour 's worth of video to your computer , the sanyo transfers video as fast as the sd card and usb 2.0 interface will allow . that means five minutes or less to transfer one hour 's worth of video to a computer . this ease increases willingess to create video and share video . no more procrastination over dragging out the camcorder wiring and the manual task of initiating video transfer to a computer . with the sanyo , just place the camera in the docking station and pictures and video files are available just like files on a usb flash drive . it is difficult to overestate the significance of this convenience . video becomes an everyday pleasure , if one so wishes , rather than a special occasion chore . if one values this convenience over absolute image quality , this is the product to own . this is a leading edge product . to get the most of this product , i highly recommend doing the following : 1 ) sanyo has provided an updated firmware on their website . this fixes a fatal flaw in the audio processing that some people have noted as excessive distortion - this update makes audio quality competitive with other camcorders . in addition , this firmware update adds compatability with 4gb sd cards ( the limit is 2gb without the update ) . kudos to sanyo for the continuing support . ( note that the instructions are a littled distorted in the translation - what they meant to write is that you need to push the set button to the left to enter the firmware update screen . ) 2 ) the video is in mp4 format and is playable only with quicktime . for windows users , this limits video editing to the included programs or quicktime-specific programs . there is an easy solution . first , download the divx codec ( a freeware commercial product ) or xvid codec ( a free open source product - my preference ) or ffdshow ( a free open source product ) - use your search engine of choice to find these . second , download a utility called " mp4cam2avi " ( a free open source software found easily with your search engine of choice ) . with these two programs , the video becomes compatable with any windows program , including just about any media player ( such as windows media player ) and any video editing tool ( such as windows movie maker ) . i look forward to seeing how this market segment evolves . the freedom from bulk and digital tedium is addicting and i am sure the image quality will continue to improve . for now , i am happy capturing the memories that would have otherwise been lost had i continued to own a conventional bulky tape-based camcorder

dvd neg 881.txt i 'll give the leads the benefit of the doubt that they 're actually a lot better than this lame-o-flick deserves . kutcher and murphy are tom and sara , the mismatched couple that loves itself to pieces in this story which strains for laughs . after a whirlwind romance , sara introduces tom to her tony beverly hills family . they marry and the rest ( much like their marriage ) is quickly history . things go bad from the wedding night ( bloody noses , no sex ) and only get worse . after tom nearly burns down the french chalet that sara booked them into ( after a fatal misunderstanding involving voltage differences in europe and an electric sex-toy ) , and compounds problems by taking them to the worst hotel in venice ( cockroaches , dust and no sex ) , our heroes quickly realize that they are on the honeymoon-from-hell . at first they gamely make a go of it , not realizing that they 're only saving their tension for the perfect moment . " just married " was a simple idea for a flick . people have been laughing at marriage for years . maybe that 's why the jokes seem forced - the sex-toy fiasco painfully illustrates how far the script will go to get a laugh , and we get that one early on . every joke is actually half of a joke about sara and tom ca n't have sex , climaxing ( really , no pun intended - i mean it ! ) when sara tricks custom 's inspectors into giving her hated hubby a full-rectal exam ( cut to the scene of tom walking bow-legged onto the plane ; obviously he 's the victim , but in the perverse logic of this unsexual non-comedy , you 've got to wonder whether tom is actually the victor - he at least got some . ) the script ca n't get past a monumental plot gap : tom and sara really do n't have anything in common - you 'd think they 'd have learnt and gotten past their foibles while they dated , but the story skips past much of that . tom 's the hero , but he 's an idiot - the script makes him out as the ugly american , an utterly dated cliche ( he 's surprised that nobody in europe watches american baseball ; he 's the kind of idiot who uses " american " instead of " english " when referring to language - as in " why is n't there a sign in american warning against using us voltage sex-toys in france ? " the laughs are far and few in between - the best ones involve cars ( both the ridiculous sub-compact they rent in france , and the dodge barracuda ( at least i think it 's a ` cuda ) that tom drives - a monster which was probably meant to remind us about " that 70 's show " but which looks like a prop from the " phantasm " movies . if ever there was a flick that needed help from " the tall man " , this is it

dvd pos 582.txt charles laughton is typically wonderful in his broadly-played role as england 's king , henry the eigth , who infamously married six different queens , divorcing or executing them as circumstances warranted . the script to this magnificent alexander korda production is a witty jab at english history buffs , touching only briefly on the supposed treachery of ann boleyn , concentrating instead on the preposterous emotional life of the lusty , capacious king . laughton , as ever , is a marvel , skillfully presenting henry at first as a thinly-cariacatured lout , and gracefully embuing him with gradual shades of pathos and humanity . viewers who look to this film as historical drama are clearly missing the point : this is all about the cleverly-rendered script , which turns british schoolboy lessons on their heads , and on the classy ensemble acting , which admittedly may be hard to focus on with the lamentable quality of the current print ( i 'm writing in the year 2003 ; perhaps criterion or some other class-act movie restoration company can correct this problem soon ) . still , fans of early british cinema will enjoy this film a lot

music neg 668.txt i am a hater , to the core . i hate puffy and thats all it is to it . now there , you do n't have to say it.so on to the review . first off every lyrical line puffy spit in this album was outdone by everybody . every track he had the weakest flow and the worst rhymes . and thats the truth . i do n't know how true this is , but i heard loon was behind most of puffy 's lines on this album . so that should explain the utter wackness in his lyrics . the truth is i do n't care who writes his lines . it could be tupac and nas doin it , since its not them spittin it , then it actually takes away from the rhymes itself . almost this entire album is filler . the best tracks is real n**** and journey through my life . i really did n't feel that beat a whole lot but nas and beanie 's verses was off the hook . however that is not enough for me to give this album more than one star . now i love mc lyte and public enemy , but they should get smacked in the back of they heads with crowbars for lettin him mutilate their classics . thats not musical artistry , thats butcher work . fake thug dedication really gets under my skin . the title alone . no disrespect to biggie as an artist cause i do like him still . but they put a diss on tupac on life after death after he died , then denied it for years . so perhaps the fake thug dedication should be to him , cause thats some sucker s***. i did n't hear his latest album , i 'm not going to review it , i did n't even visit that section . if you a fan of this guy , then you gon cop this and his new one regardless . if you like me and hate just about everything he puts out , you wo n't be caught within a mile of that s***
music neg 590.txt first , here are some general positives about jaci velasquez : - she is a very gifted singer . her vocal range is top-notch - definitely on par with mariah carey and christina aguilera . - she is beautiful . and unlike a previous reviewer , i do not consider the recognition of this attribute to be a sign of shallowness but rather a display of appreciation for feminine beauty . i like beautiful singing voices . i like beautiful women . there 's no difference . - she has great spiritual depth . her music reflects key spiritual themes such as love , faith and joy . now , here 's a critique of the cd : i listened to all the music samples ( as you can do as well ) and only one song caught my attention - " lay it down " . the other tracks have too much of a hard rock sound and were too experimental for my taste . but the song " lay it down " was different . it sounded more acoustic , more in the style of folk rock - a genre that reflects my personal preference in pop music . i found the sound clip of " lay it down " to be intriguing because it reminded me of a hit song in the 1970 's - eric carmen 's " all by myself " , later covered by celine dion in 1996. " all by myself " is a ballad having a soft , understated introductory verse with an explosive chorus . the sample clip of " lay it down " appears to be in the same mold . it has a soft , understated introductory verse ; however , it seems to lack an explosive chorus . listen to the sample and hear it for yourself . the introductory verse is closing with the following lyrics : " all of my hopes and my dreams and my best laid plans are slowly slipping through my folded hands " so far , so good . there 's only a piano and a violin accompanying jaci 's soft vocals . next , the song appears to be moving from the verse to the chorus and you hear the following lyrics : " so i 'm gonna lay it down i 'm gonna learn to trust you now " now here 's a problem . i am expecting to hear the beginning of an emotional outburst - an opportunity for a singer with the pipes of jaci velasquez to showcase her voice . but it is not forthcoming . why ? this intrigued me and i wanted to hear the whole song but i did not want to purchase a cd for only one song . luckily , i discovered that a compilation cd of jaci velasquez 's best songs was released recently and it contained " lay it down " . great ! i bought the cd - " on my knees : the best of jaci velasquez " . this is what i discovered after listening to " lay it down " . - the first time through the verse and the chorus , the song is definitely understated . we simply have the accompaninment of a piano and a violin with jaci 's soft vocals . - the second time through the verse and the chorus , a drum beat is introduced and jaci begins to let some emotion out beginning in the middle of the verse and when the song moves into the chorus a complete emotional outburst occurs . but somewhat to my dismay , this is not the same voice that i am expecting from jaci velasquez . her voice was more raspy and raw ( actually , it was sounding more like demi moore or tara reid , not that that is necessarily bad ) . furthermore , she appeared to be struggling . is this the same voice that was soaring effortlessly through the stratosphere on songs such as " on my knees " , " speak for me " , and " adore " ? is jaci velasquez losing her voice ? i do n't know but i find it very difficult to imagine that a young woman in her mid-20 's is losing her voice . she is entering her prime . barring a health issue , this just does n't happen . " lay it down " is actually a pretty good song . in fact , i am almost of the opinion that it may be her best . i certainly find myself listening to this song more than any of her others . " lay it down " has the same message as the beatles ' classic " let it be " . the words are different but both songs share the same sentiment . actually , now that i think of it...they do share a couple of words in common...the words " let it be " . here are the closing lyrics : " i 'm gonna let it be , i 'm gonna let it go i 'm gonna lay it down " the essential lesson being conveyed is learning to " let go and let god " - a profound spiritual insight . something that each of us here is learning . this song is heartfelt and gut-wrenching . and though her voice is struggling through it , the song , nevertheless , works out its magic . i gave this cd 2 stars because i think jaci velasquez is attempting to redefine her music style and has not succeeded . interestingly enough , her best sound was her first cd - un lugar celestial ( a heavenly place ) . bring back the spanish / flamenco guitar and develop a more acoustic sound . in my opinion , the acoustic sound is more spiritual . keep the piano and electric bass guitar but dispense with the hard rock electric guitar and synthesized sound effects . develop a latin folk rock sound with an element of jazz . hire a good saxophonist or a trumpet player . emphasize ballads . that should do the trick

dvd neg 816.txt two of the worst stories in the history of tos , but for different reasons . the ' way to eden ' makes the mistake of trying to be trendy , and so dates badly . what the real problem is though is that it makes the enterprise crew seem to be the disapproving establishment , especially of all people captain kirk . ' requiem for methuselah ' is at heart a reasonable story with the assertion that one man could be responsible for the work of da vinci , brahms and others . what it completely fails to do is have any appreciation for kirk 's relationships with women . threre is no way any woman would have kirk obsessed to the point he would fight for her , he is far to full of his own importance for that . this effectively trashes any credibility that the story would have had because this is the crux of the whole episode . a real pity
music neg 219.txt that this great music sounds so awful on this cd . i wanted an introduction to kate bush 's music , and this cd seemed a very good way to start . when i put it on , i could n't believe how muffled and dull it sounded . i could swear i 'm listening to the music through a wall of cotton . i went to the existing reviews here on amazon , and , sure enough , ferrara brain pan 's spot-on review stated exactly what i was feeling upon listening to these recordings . it is inexcusable that an artist of bush 's stature is represented in such poor technical fashion - and a shame , considering how good the songs are . another little beef is that the cd clocks in at under 49 minutes - in other words , there 's room for 30 more minutes of music , which i 'm certain could have been well-used , considering the vastness of her catalogue . i will be looking for the remastered individual albums , but if i did n't know how good kate bush was outside of the context provided by this butchered collection , i would n't bother buying any more of her material . shame on emi for allowing this . i give it two stars ( instead of one ) simply because the music is so very good

camera neg 243.txt i made the mistake of ordering this camera to substitute buying a pro camera . the color and noise was terrible . if you want a great point and shoot camera get the canon powershot s50 while they are still available . the camera has pro features , it was so good they stopped making it because it should have been in the pro camera line at a much higher price tag . if you want to see s50 pictures go to [...] and search my gallery cathreen styles . all most all of the pictures in the gallery were taken with the s50. i am going to buy another just to have when mine breaks . by the way , i did end up buy a pro camera , mainly because of the look . i got the canon 30d and love it

music neg 349.txt ...when you 're gearing up for suicide . this whole album sounds like the last thoughts and comments of a person who 's going to just end it all . i found myself suffering nightmares , fatigue , misery and paranoia . my ears unclogged but i started getting headaches and a fuzzy feel in my head . this is not a good album for the stressed , because it will just make you feel worse . i find this album unlikable and mostly unenjoyable . when i first listened to it it sounded inaccessable , after listening to it more and more i started to get more " into " it , but i ca n't say i found it a good place to be in . it 's a somewhat interesting album , but it mostly just dragged me down , made me nervous , numb and hurt my head . people say this is great music . let them say what they want . give me some old fashioned enjoyable music that does n't make a pest of itself . kid a is just ok to me , and has n't been worth all the effort to " get into " . this almost seems like a sadomasochistic album to spank the listeners . i do n't know , maybe i 'm missing something , but to hear some " weird " music like this that has miles more heart and is alot kinder to the ears , try " passengers " by u2. and thom york sings like a muppet on this album . by the way i 've enjoyed radiohead 's first three albums quite a bit ( including pablo honey - - why are people always busting its chops ) .

health neg 560.txt if you 're just mixing non-gas-forming drink mixes , this thing works acceptably well , but if you 're mixing something like " ionic fizz " magnesium drink that fizzes up a bit , it 's not very useful because it just does n't form a very good seal , no matter how tightly you close it . as another reviewer mentioned , it 's very easy to cross-thread the lid . thicker threads and deeper threads would probably help . it is great for sipping though , and easy enough to keep clean . but i went back to using a plastic 16-oz milk bottle that always forms a tight seal when you close it . the seal on this bottle is too flaky because it 's difficult to tell if you 've cross-threaded it until you start shaking it . i 'd have expected a bottle designed for shaking and mixing drinks would have paid a little more attention to the problems this has . i do n't use this any more , because it 's too annoying to worry about the seal and the cross-threading . do n't waste your money on it .
books pos 246.txt lee smolin is a very deep thinker and original physics theorist , ready if needs be , to question cherished assumptions . one is humbled at how fertile his mind is and how he is familiar with the ideas and the research of so many people the book is mainly an account of his misgivings about string theory , where he initially states , as he sees it , the five big problems in physics . in this context , he makes the very important point that since the end of the 1970 's there has not been a single breakthrough in our understanding of elementary particle physics and , in particular , he claims string theory does not achieve such a breakthrough . in making his case against string theory he discusses what string theory has given and shows how it appeared to offer a solution to some of the problems of theoretical physics . but then he builds up his case against the theory . he says that string theory does not reproduce the standard model , probably the most successful theory in physics , but even predicts particles not seen in nature . it did not predict and does not cater for dark energy , nor does it make new precise and falsifiable predictions . in particular he says string theory does not offer a solution to the foundational problems of quantum mechanics . he also notes that here is no complete formulation for string theory . he shows though how the five versions of string theory could be unified if membranes rather than strings were assumed , but notes that this theory , m theory , still remains a tantalizing conjecture . he says hopes for a unique string theory have receded . this reviewer would not dare to comment on his assertions but will say that any assertions he makes , are based on a very thorough knowledge of modern theoretical physics and merit the full consideration and respect of the reader . indeed new ideas are needed in physics as lee smolin says . we are missing something big . there is a feeling though that we are on the verge of that big breakthrough - that something just beyond our understanding at the moment will surface through the ` murk ' into our consciousness and revolutionize our knowledge of nature . the clues are there . to do this , lee rightly says that the sort of people who see through universal assumptions and ask new questions are needed . he also says that progress sometimes requires deep philosophical thinking but sometimes does not . and whether it is ` lateral ' thinking or a breakthrough revolution in ` conceptual ' thinking , new thinking is definitely required . lee concludes his book saying that what he intends to do is just that . he chooses to start with a paper of his on the relationship between quantum and thermal fluctuation . a good choice perhaps . i strongly recommend that anybody who is interested in physics and the current problems and mysteries in the area to immediately buy this book , if they have not already done so .

music pos 295.txt the earlier reviews pretty much said it all ; this is pretty much one of the best and most overlooked bands from the 90s . swervedriver is lumped into the shoegazer category often , however , if that label scares you off then dismiss its application to this band , because they are n't so much shoegazer - in that cough-syrup-dreamy-noise way - as they are sonic rock . yes , rock . who knew it could still be done , and believe me , they do it well , and uniquely . if you 've listened to swervedriver before , then tehre is n't too much more to say - buy this album . it 's not as hi-fi as 99th dream or mezcal head ( in my opinion their best album and one of the best of 90s decade ) , but not as fast or dirty as raise . now , if you have never listened to swervedriver , this might not be the best album to start with - it all depends on your tastes . personally , i would suggest starting with 99th dream or mezcal head ; either way , this has all the qualities of every swervedriver album - great lyrics , superb and unique songs , and that urge for more when it 's over . sadly , this band was vastly ill-treated by labels and they are no longer together ( however , some vestiges exist in the form of toshack highway ) . but if you want to see what you missed in the 90s - even more so , if you want to see what the best of the best from that decade truly was - swervedriver is a must

camera neg 560.txt here is the short version . oct05 i bought a fujifilm finepix f460 digital camera for $299.99. nov06 camera stopped working correctly - snapshots have alternating bright / dark horizonal strips across them . jan07 i sent the camera in to fujifilm 's service center for repair stating that the camera was always handled with care and that a ~$300 camera should work for more than just 1 month after its warranty expires . jan07 the service center sent me a repair estimate for $70.00 + tax and shipping totaling $85.95 ( i spent $16.52 to send it to them so my total expense would have been $102.47 for the repair if i accepted ) . feb07 i contacted the service center and stated that i think they should stand behind their product and fix the camera once they verify the malfunction was not caused by user abuse . and that i do n't think that it makes sense for me to pay $100 to repair a $300 camera that stopped working only 1 month after the warranty expired . the service rep , named christina , asked me to fax her a copy of the original reciept and she would see what she could do . i complied . mar07 fujifilm returned the camera to me unrepaired with a note saying that i did not reply to the estimate . now i will now send them the camera and its memory card and a printout of this review asking them to refund the cost of the camera , its memory card , and the shipping i paid .

books neg 584.txt i am a big fan of the missing manual series . previous books have given me lots of insights into my installed software and have made my computing time much more efficient . i therefore approached this book with much enthusiasm . office is such a gargantuan program , with tons of bells and whistles , that microsoft itself estimates that most users take advantage of less than a third of its capabilities . however , the book is a major disappointment , because of its many mistakes and poor organization . most of the mistakes are ones you can work around- -for example , on page 8 the topics covered by appendixes a and b are reversed- -but the sheer number of such mistakes makes reading the book a major distraction . every few pages i find myself going to the missing manuals web site to report yet more errata , such as incomplete or wrong instructions , figures that do not agree with the text or figure captions , incomprehensible writing , seeming confusion between the mac and pc versions of the program , etc. and i agree wholeheartedly with a previous reviewer who complained about the inadequate index . it looks as though o'reilly publishers did not do an adequate proofing of the book , but instead rushed it out as soon as possible . that is too bad , because i will now be much more hesitant to purchase another missing manuals title
software pos 460.txt i am a computer repair tech and i can bet 90% of the problems reported in these reviews for this product is because people double install security programs . you should never install more than 1 antivirus program into your os . most of the decriptions of problems are from doing just that , double installs . please please ..remove / uninstall any previous antivirus programs and 3rd party firewalls . then reboot..use a good registry cleaner-freeware program like ccleaner to remove leftover registry keys , then reboot again and then and only then install your new antivirus / security program . i have this program and when installed properly on a cleaned system , it works great . a very good product at a very good price . i ca n't comment on it 's tech support , i have never used it

software pos 905.txt i 'm not going to cover the technical drawbacks of this software except to briefly mention that you should look over other reviews before you buy . however , despite annoying design features , this is quite an amazing piece of software ! i would certainly rate it a 5+ if there were n't some design shortcomings and undocumented features ; ) for starters , the educational intent of this software was well thought out . young people will certainly learn a lot about chess through using this program and they will have tremendous fun doing it ! the game teaches fairly advanced concepts in very clever and engaging ways for children of all ages and even adults . the graphics and characters are great . the explanations of principles are sound and they are reinforced through fun chess exercises . the program encourages young chess players and at the same time challenges them to improve . the product description above covers the scope of the concepts covered in detail and i found this description to be accurate so i wo n't repeat it . i spent about 2 hours with a 9 year old playing the game and i had a lot of fun ! i did n't find that this program was especially difficult to use and my young friend was able to figure it out intuitively . he also found it difficult to pull himself away and so did i . this definitely an activity you can enjoy along with your children . the overall concept for this teaching tool is interesting because it involves three layers of play . there is the overall game of rescuing the king who is trapped in the castle which is used as a tool to motivate the player to learn new chess skills that allow them to progress in this higher order game . embedded within this larger framework are a number of clever chess teaching games where you can record high scores and learn various skills . these can be selected from within an animated room , which gives the player some freedom of choice . additionally , there are other fun games that are not necessarily related to chess , but that allow the player to relax their chess concentration and refresh themselves for tackling more difficult chess skills challenges . i also think it 's good that kids could join [...] for a year and play against others as part of the purchase price . this gives them an arena to apply their chess knowledge and is a good community that is always available . there are other online chess communities that are free , but i still think this is a nice added bonus . i do n't think any parent could go wrong purchasing this software for their child . it 's good for hundreds or even thousands of hours of entertainment and its powered by an excellent chess engine . however , you ca n't play a game of chess against the computer with it . it is only a teaching tool . however , you can buy fritz grandmaster software for about [...] which does have this capability at a very low price point compared to other products of comparable playing ability . i 've heard criticisms of fritz 9 and my understanding is the extra cost does not add a lot of value . in fact , at this point there seems to be some bugs with fritz 9. if you purchase this product , you wo n't be disappointed . i wish they had it when i was learning to play chess

music pos 740.txt many musicians release some sort of experimental album at some point in their career . for peter gabriel , every album is an experiment . usually musicians experiment by deviating from the norm ; however , on gabriel 's fifth experiment , so , the ex-genesis frontman does the exact opposite . gabriel , beloved for always doing something different , decided on this album to play it safe - and for gabriel , that is an experiment . previously he was a sort of cult performer , but on so , gabriel finally made it into the spotlight . big time . so was an immense success , peaking at number one on the billboard top 100 , receiving overwhelmingly-positive reviews ( in 2003 , so placed 187th on rolling stone 's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time ) , and resulting in a sold-out tour . which brings us to one nagging term : " sellout " . though most who loved peter gabriel 's first four albums loved so as well , there are still many who call so gabriel 's sellout album . to me , that 's just foolishness . peter gabriel has never " sold out " and i have no doubt that he never will . it 's clear that on so he was trying to go in a more mainstream direction , but that 's probably the biggest experiment gabriel has ever undertaken , save for his subsequent release , passion . one popular theory amongst gabriel fans is that the album 's title , so , is in fact an acronym for " sell out " ( hence the uppercase capital " s " and the lowercase italicized " o " ) . i would n't be surprised at all if it was . so does sound very different from gabriel 's earlier albums ( though then again , none of those sounded alike either ) . if anything , it resembles gabriel 's third self-titled release , nicknamed melt . the thing that really separates those two - other than an obviously more commercial sound on so - is a feeling of warmth on that album , unlike the harsh , gritty darkness of melt . perhaps that 's why listeners found so so charming . what does so have to offer ? well , a lot . for one thing , there 's the atmospheric opening , " red rain " , one of gabriel 's finest tracks . like many of the tracks on the album , it 's dominated by ethereal guitar from david rhodes and heavenly synthesizers , courtesy of gabriel himself . then there 's one of the biggest hits of 1980s ( which also spawned what may be the best music video in history ) , " sledgehammer , " inspired by the motown music gabriel listened to as a child . with its pounding , industrial percussion , playful bass ( by gabriel 's exclusive bass man , tony levin ) and clever , sexually suggestive lyrics , it 's no surprise that " sledgehammer " was a hit . after letting his silly side out , gabriel tries to inspire with " do n't give up " , a nice song made great by heavenly vocals from another popular 80s musician , kate bush . the subsequent track , " that voice again " , is my personal favorite song from this album . it features some excellent drumming from manu katche , an immensely-talented drummer who has also played with artists like sting , along with misty guitars , delightful synthesizers , and fine lyrics hit home by gabriel 's pained singing . like the best tracks on so , " that voice again " manages to be fun , moody , uplifting , powerful , warm , and inspirational , all at once . gabriel winds down a little for the dreamy , powerful " mercy street " , a song inspired by and written about anne sexton , an american mental patient who relieved her depression through writing . as on his previous albums , gabriel proves that he knows when to lighten up by whipping out " big time " , a silly but fun track which also spawned an innovative music video . " big time " features heavy drumming from stewart copeland , the former drummer of the police , as well as some awesome cmi by simon clark . " we do what we 're told ( miligram 's 37 ) " is about the experiments of yale professor stanley milgram . milgram would have his subjects administer shocks to actors , who would scream in pain as the shocks became more and more horrible . milgram observed that his subjects would do what he told them to do , despite the immense pain they appeared to be inflicting on the actors . he follows that rather cold song with " this is the picture ( excellent birds ) " , a tensely surreal tune . the album closes with one of gabriel 's most famous songs , " in your eyes " . most people are familiar with the song from its usage in cameron crowe 's romantic comedy masterpiece ... say anything , where the song was used in what has become one of the most famous scenes in movie history . it 's one of gabriel 's warmest and most romantic compositions , and also one of his best . on the original lp version of so , " we do what we 're told " closed out the album . that 's a fine way to end it , but it 's also a rather cold way to end such a warm album . when the album was re-released remastered on cd in 2002 , gabriel placed " in your eyes " at the end of the album as he originally intended . now that is the way to end it ! so - how does so rank among the many other brilliant works of peter gabriel ? well , it ranks quite highly , actually . it 's one of the pinnacles of gabriel 's career , though whether it truly is the peak or not is hard to say . after all , how can one compare gabriel 's albums when they are all so vastly different ? certainly , though , so is one of the finest gabriel masterpieces . this is fun , well-crafted , emotional music . so is so wonderful .

dvd neg 38.txt therese , lux , mary , bonnie and cecilia make up the five lisbon girls , ages 13 , 14 , 15 , 16 and 17. cecilia , the youngest , lives in her sisters shadows because they are all older and of much more interest to their male neighbors . as a cry for help , she slits her wrists and lays down in the bathtub , she survived the incident . after a psychiatrist highly impresses upon the strict mr. and mrs. lisbon that it would be benificial for cecilia to be exposed to environments which have boys her own age , mr. and mrs. lisbon decide to allow the girls to throw the one and only lisbon party . some of the neighborhood 's boys are invited over and while the party is in session , cecilia is pretty inanimate , sitting on the couch while her sisters flirt , talk and laugh . midway through the party , cecilia asks to be excused and mrs. lisbon - though somewhat reluctantly - allows it . cecilia goes up to her room ( on the second floor of a two-story house ) and jumps out the window , landing on the spiked fence on the front lawn of the lisbon house . in this way , cecilia lisbon commited suicide . only four girls remain . the act which cecilia committed did not go at all unnoticed . the father saw her immediately , the party ended there and all of the boys went home rather glum . four of the lisbon 's neighbors , four young boys , suffered a rapidly growing obsession with the lisbon girls , who were beautiful and a total mystery to the outside world . they got hold of cecilia 's diary and tried to explain why she committed suicide . the eldest decided cecilia was a dreamer , and she did not think she would fall when she jumped out her window , she thought she would fly . with their youngest sister gone , the remaining lisbon girls grow closer to each other , stranding themselves further from the outside world . when school starts again , they attempt to go on acting as if nothing happened , not ever mentioning their youngest sister . the run-of-the-mill awkward act is taken part by the rest of the school however . the usual profuse apology to the mention of the word " death " and the like . trip fontaine is the most popular guy in school , the object of desire to all of the girls at school.. . except for the lisbon girls , which is of no importance to trip until he sets eyes on lux . trip cannot help but be enchanted by her flawless beauty . in the beginning , he is unsuccessful in his quest to even catch her attention for she bluntly shows she 's not interested . but after his consistent courtship , lux falls for his charming ways . trip then attempts to convince mr. lisbon to let him and three of his football team pals take the lisbon daughters to homecoming . after mr. lisbon talks to his wife , he agrees to trip 's request , knowing nothing but trip 's sincerity and claimed honorable intentions , on the understanding that trip have all of the lisbon girls returned to the house by curfew . after trip explains the situation to his football peers , he gives in to those who bribe him the most handsomely . meanwhile , the lisbon girls are picking out fabric for the dresses they shall wear to the homecoming dance . though one pattern is used for all four dresses , each dress looks unique when concentrating on detail . once they pick up the girls , they stop midway to the homecoming in order to smoke , lux being the only girl volunteering to smoke . they then drive to the dance . trip and lux sneak away and sneak swallows of alcohol . another one of the lisbon sisters and her date follow , but leave soon afterwards , not being as wild nor daring as trip and lux . at the time they all decided to meet back at the car so they could make the girls curfew , they are all there.. . except for trip and lux , who at that time were alone in the middle of the football stadium field . deciding they must make their own curfews , therese , bonnie , mary and their dates leave without them . after fooling around , the intoxicated trip and lux fall asleep in the middle of the football stadium . trip awakens in the middle of the night and leaves lux there alone . when lux wakes up early the next morning she is confused as to why trip is not there . she takes a taxi home and her parents were worried sick ( of course ) . but they take measures as far as pulling the girls out of school and stranding them inside the lisbon residence . the girls , in a desperate attempt to hold onto a connection to the outside world , begin using morse code to interact with the four boys who so closely follow their lives . one of which boys lived across the street and the rest which came over daily after this in order to contact the girls . soon following , the boys begin talking to the lisbon girls via phone . one day , the girls invite the boys to come over once mr. and mrs. lisbon are asleep . the plan being that the boys were to drive the girls somewhere , the boys hastily agree . they sneak over and lux invites them to wait inside for her sisters and lux goes to wait in the car . the boys wander down to the basement while waiting for therese , bonnie and mary , verbally expressing their hopes for the night . but then they realize they have stumbled upon one of the sisters . she had hung herself . the boys , scared to death , run all the way home . time passed , things changed , girls came and went.. . but no matter what , those four boys never forgot the lisbon suicides . ultimately , the movie was nothing short of queer . when trying to sum up the story in a few lines ( such as " follow the lives of the lisbon sisters and how they connect to their neighbors . a story full of obsession , gossip , lust , love , desire and isolation . " ) the story sounds quite unique and intriguing , but the story fell short of that for me personally . partly because the lisbon sisters really committed suicide for a reason not much deeper than isolation . the movie , in places , is also extremely flawed . i do not believe mr. and mrs. lisbon could 've removed their daughters from school for so long without their daughters being taken from them by social services . in many parts of the movie , they should 've used upbeat music to fill the deafening silences . the whole movie was filmed in a style that i can truthfully say makes me rather bored . i would only suggest this film to , perhaps , people who like movies such as " elizabethtown " which kirsten dunst is also in . but i personally disliked this movie which was not very tasteful and will not be watching it again in the future

books neg 743.txt this " book " is probably the worst written i 've ever encountered . it was so flawed as to be considered literature . alice walker tries to " one-up " harriet beecher stowe , in writing about brutality . titles like these are weapons used in the anti-black male agenda this society has long perpetuated . all the men depicted in this book are one-dimensional characters with absolutely no redeeming qualities worth noting . the women are portrayed as martyred , forlorn , pseudo-saints who have been set upon by beasts from hell . the only persons capable of any sort of humanity are exclusively women . i 've learned long ago , when absolutes such as these are presented , a greater agenda is at work . there are no " real " men in this book ! only distorted caricatures of black masculinity . i only found value in this book as a comprehensive example of sexist misandry at its worst . i find this title as dangerous as hitler 's " mien kampf " , in it 's portrayal of black men as evil and morally destitute . presenting such depictions is both dangerous and irresponsible . true , there are criminally abusive men in every culture . but there are also forthright , upstanding men as well . to present a depiction of such vehement imbalance and disparity , only serves to distort the readers view of the people being written about . harriet beecher stowe 's fictional " uncle tom 's cabin " , sparked national outrage and eventually a bloody civil war . this title does no less in further distorting the readers perceptions of black men . this book is fiction . however , it is not presented as such . i 'm sure the abusive incidents depicted in this book have been based upon actual incidents . i have no qualm about outrage at such abominations . however , i do have a problem when there are absolutely no upstanding male figures who intervene in such aberrations . that is what i find so unbelievable and offensive about this book . in my opinion , this novel does nothing to laud the strength of women so much as it demeans and distorts the readers / viewers of the people within it . i do n't find it a testament to the strength of black women at all . i interpret this book as feminist misandry with two purposes...the further distortion of african-american culture and the deliberate depiction and denigration of the black male as being hopelessly inhuman . i 'm sure alice walker made a lot of money with this book . feminist , racist extremism seems to have found a niche in literature . i wonder if this novel would have had the same accolades , were it a fictional depiction of white american men brutalizing white women . most definitely not ! ! ! i doubt it would have even found a publisher . america is comfortable reinforcing negative depictions of black men and african-american culture . my life as a black man is difficult enough living as a testament and example against this sort of racial distortion . whatever ms. walker 's motivations were in writing this novel , i 'm sure mercenary incentives were not discounted . this is racist , misandrist propaganda masquerading as literature !

music neg 186.txt clipped , petite and looking more like a leather bar anne murray , crow drags out the hits and the ` friends ' for this all-star live bash . half the album is standard issue and straight ahead stage sweat with the morning beer-buzz afficiando going it alone without a little help from her friends ( all i wanna do , everyday is a winding road , a change would do you good , leaving las vegas ) . with only slight variations on these overplayed originals ( a sychopantic crowd and some tinkering with the rhythms ) crow 's solo chores rarely rate more than a grudging ho-hum . the rest of the album is a parade of snap-on tools ( dixie chicks , stevie nicks , eric clapton , sarah mclachlan , chrissie hynde ) who easily steal the spotlight from their downhome hash-slinging waitress / host . reduced to the role of supporting guitarist , crow butters the toast from the sidelines as femme contemporaries like nicks ( who unravels admirably on gold dust woman ) , hynde and mclachlan flounder about the mike in a haphazard hit ( hynde 's if it makes you happy ) -and-miss ( mclachlan 's the difficult kind ) headbutt at crow 's hits . but it is n't until clapton 's suspendered , cigar-chomping husk is rolled out to update cream 's white room that the sour stench of monstrous micalculation reaches it 's devastating climax . fresh from watering the daisies and still in his jammies , clapton 's return to the electric psychedelics of his paleolithic past is a fumbling bumbling fiasco unleashed with the grace and finesse of a diarrhetic brontosaurus . it 's horrifying to think that this is what cream would have sounded like if they had n't broken up . thank god for egos . it 's almost a relief to hear richards mindlessly croak his way through the old stones exile-era toss-off happy , as if a cadaverous ex-junkie with the durability of a cockroach and nine lives would be anything but . besides , richards provides wonderful comic relief and criticizing his artistic capacity is as futile as pointing out the flaws in the bandages on an egyptian mummy . the wrapper finds the entire gang , from spanky nicks to buckwheat clapton , joining hands for a bizarre entreaty with a kindergarten rendition of dylan 's tombstone blues - a fitting finale if there ever was one

music neg 157.txt sarah brightman is one of my all time favorite artists . but this disc is just a complete waste . it is missing so much , and has too many songs that do n't belong . like the phantom songs . as much as i love them , save them for the andrew llyod webber collections . ca n't we have a nice singles collection with just her solo works starting from " dive " ? her " classics " album had it right . except their version of " captain nemo " was the rip off live version . and this cd does n't even have the captain nemo song , which is a huge fan favorite , and definitly was a single . it is also missing how can heaven love me , eden , harem , and beautiful . all singles as well . save your money . either buy the " classics " album for a somewhat better compilation , or just make your own mix like i did . because sarah has so many wonderful songs ( and quite a few bad ones i will admit ) and it seems on here they give you some bad ones ( like requium and nella fantasia ) , and leave out the good ones . " it 's a beautiful day " and " what you never know " are good , but are the weakest songs form harem . why on earth would you leave out " harem " and " beautiful " , but leave on beautiful day and wynk ? whoever put this set list together must have not put much thought into it and is just trying to cash in . i bet sarah did n't have much say in this compilation . this is just a waste . beautiful album cover though

books pos 141.txt " the great locomotive chase " is the stuff of legend . this somewhat obscure event , which commemorated the first anniversary of the first shots on fort sumter , could too easily be written off among civil war devotees as a lark , a foolhardy distraction from the inexorable march from shiloh to the seven days , to second manassas , to the three more years of bloodletting that were required in order to form a more perfect union . but first-time author russell bonds does a masterful job of taking this adventure story on its own terms , telling it well , and placing it in its proper context . the raid itself is a gripping story of intrigue , espionage , and derring-do . and if mr. bonds had only told the tale itself , this book would be well worth the read . but what sets this distinguished this book apart from so much civil war writing is mr. bonds 's ability to tell this gripping tale objectively , while putting it in its proper context . the author sets the table with a relatively brief yet thorough overview of the strategic arrangement of the war nine months after first manassas . and by doing so , and by explaining why the raid , coupled with the deep penetration of general ormsby mitchell into tennessee and north alabama , offered the fleeting chance to cut the confederacy in two and thereby hasten the end of the war , mr. bonds gives the otherwise reckless ï¿½lan of the raiders its proper place . andrews and his raiders were not off on a lark , even though students of the era will have the natural reaction , " what were they thinking ? " mr. bonds answers that question , and the answer , as incongruous as it may seem , reminds the reader that there was so much more to the great war than the epic battles of the armies of the potomac and northern virginia . if the author had done nothing more than told the story of the great raid , reconciling contemporary accounts that were so often embellished , this would be a wonderful adventure story , in the great tradition of shelby foote 's narrative history of the war . but this book does so much more . it puts the raid in its proper strategic context , and it tells the story of the gallant raiders after the raid itself failed . this book will satisfy both the devoted civil war critic and the general reader who loves a historical tale well-told .

health neg 456.txt these hair topia pills are nothing but garbage ! pure nonsense ! trust me , i know this because i used to buy them . i first bought these pills last year in june 2005 after hair formula 37 's unsuccessful promise of producing longer and stronger hair in the four months of usage . well , these pills were not as expensive as the previous brand mentioned , and had promised also to change dry and brittle hair to long and healthy , and it did absolute nothing . i said to myself , like hair formula 37 , that maybe i just need to give this more time , so i bought a 2-month supply and gave it 3 months in all and there was no difference at all . this product might just work for others , which it has , but it certainly did n't work for me . i must admit that i brought this on myself , as my mother warned me not to buy these ridiculously expensive pill since they do nothing for hair that grows naturally anyway , and that if you really want to get hair pills then just buy them a whole lot cheaper in regular stores like giant or even hair vitamins in the damn dollar store ! these hair growth pills are too damn expensive , so when you are paying all of that money then you expect it to work . the fact that it does not is infuriating because $39.99 + $7 in shipping , with a total of a little over $46 , is a lot of money to spend on something that does nothing . thus , i am here to warn others not to waste their precious money . and if you are going to , please do n't do it on this site-you can buy this product a little cheaper at hairboutique.com .

books pos 427.txt this was a fabulous resource for understanding the evolution of the marian cult . the one weakness of this book is that it did not deal with the pre-christian origins of the marian cult . other resources , however , cover the evolution of the anatolian fertility cult of cybele into the roman magna mater and later into the so-called & quot ; bvm&quot ; . the author does a good job of showing the origins of various aspects of mariology and contrasting these developments with christianity in the west . the author has done a great service to those who wish to more fully understand the syncretic process which blended christianity with various pagan religions and medeival political structures to create the roman catholic church
dvd pos 210.txt this is an outstanding documentary of the campaign team that changed presidential campaigning . one does not need to love the results of these changes ( i personally believe that this campaign was the beginning of the end of democracy as we know it , even as i marveled at the talent and loved the outcome of the election ) to appreciate how clinton 's 1992 campaign , as seen in this film , changed the american political world . " war room " should be seen along with more recent documentaries ( like , for example , " staffers ' 04 " ) to see the difference between a campaign that used techniques to achieve a goal and campaigns that use the same techniques as the goal ( to be elected rather than to govern ) . hopefully , it will encourage you to do what you can to return political campaigns to discussions of ideas rather than the useless , mind-numbing , dumbing down assessments of candidate traits ( like " character " or " integrity " ) we seem to have resorted to in the past ten years

( i do not know where they got those myths from ) - another fragment of their imagination , i suppose . this " business " book is more of a " romantic novel " about something relating to " teams " , full of anecdotal references ( very life-like ) - but totally unsubstantiated , wanting us to " believe " that indeed , " teams things " are like they describe it . from an entertaining point of view - very . from an academic point of view - null . for a business person - if you have time to waist , have fun . it is interesting to note that they got a uk award for their book . ( for entertaining i suppose ) . i guess this is a way of promoting the book . good marketing technique .

dvd pos 51.txt scrubs has been a model of consistency in its five seasons- -and to interrupt myself , why are n't we anticipating season five instead of season four ? and boo ! on them for being so slow to bring the show out on dvd ! - -and season four is no exception . i recently rewatched seasons 1 through 3 on dvd with my daughter and it really brought home just how great this series has been from the very beginning to the present . if you visit boards there are always prognosticators who declare that it is n't as good as it used to be , but i would be dishonest if i said that i detected any decline . one thing i 've really enjoyed is that unlike situation comedies , this one really does have an overall story arc , and i really appreciate bill lawrence and co. taking the time to reward fans of the show in this way . the story in season four revolves largely around the very , very gradual repair of the friendship between jd and elliott . fans of the show know that at the end of season three jd , utterly smitten by elliott , had expressed his love for her , causing her to break off her relationship with her boyfriend to be with jd . no sooner had he done this , however , he once again felt trapped and almost immediately broke things off with her . season four opens with her filled with hatred of him , complicated by the fact that she and he are named co-chief residents ( though there is wonderful confusion over the fact that the name plate on her door reads- -thanks to janitor- - " chief resident " and his misleadingly reads " co-chief resident , " causing many to imagine that she is over him ) . some of my favorite visuals in the series are of jd and elliott wedged into their ultra tiny office , barely large enough for the desk they face each other across . of course , eventually they patch things up , but for the first season have no kind of romantic entanglement . given the intensity of the events of the ends of season three , any sort of getting together would certainly have ended with elliott murdering jd . the season ends with carla and turk urging jd to move out and get a place of his own , which leads to an interesting roommate situation in season five . season four continued the scrubs tradition of having some very high profile guest stars . this was marred somewhat by having the absolutely dreadful colin farrell on one episode , an episode through which he drifted as if completely drunk or totally bored ( there have been very few bad episodes of scrubs , but this episode ranks near the bottom ) . the always delightful heather graham sparkled through several episodes earlier in the season . matthew perry stopped by for an episode less interesting for his presence than for his being teamed with his father , jonathan bennett perry , a country singer best known to most people as the old spice sailor . tara reid puts in another appearance as jd 's terrible sometimes girlfriend while molly shannon is in another episode . and julianna margulies of er appears in a couple of episodes . the great tragedy with scrubs is that it remains something of a secret . the only comedy better than scrubs in the past few years has been arrested development ( most fans of one show tend to be a fan of the other as well , and the lead of each show appeared on the other , zach braff as the producer of the girls with low self-esteem series of videos on ar and jason bateman as a patient on scrubs ) and while it won a large number of awards , its ratings were worse than scrubs . this show has decent ratings , but shockingly few awards . how terrible shows like everybody loves raymond and the formerly good but now dull will and grace beat it out for awards is mystifying . and how did it manage only one emmy nomination ? it was nominated for best comedy series , but why was n't zach braff nominated for best comic actor and john c . mcginley and donald faison for best supporting actor in a comedy series and sarah chalke for best supporting actress in a comedy series ? how is that possible ? much ink has been spilt on how the 2006 emmy nominations have made less sense than any in memory ( lauren graham yet again not nominated , though clearly the best comic actress on tv for at least five years and five vastly less talented women were nominated instead of her ; lost not nominated ; no nominations for veronica mars ; jason lee not nominated for my name is earl ; neither michael chiklis , hugh laurie , nor james gandolofini nominated for best actor , while martin sheen who was barely appeared in this year 's west wing ; while shows way , way , way , way past their prime like will and grace and the west wing nominated ; and the list goes on ) but zach braff 's failure to be nominated while charlie sheen and kevin james did is just one more reason not to take the emmys seriously at all . at least the golden globes more or else get it right . anyway , awards aside , and armed with the knowledge that the best shows are usually neglected by the emmys ( how many emmy nods did buffy get despite most of the nation 's best tv critics passionately begging each year for it to get the recognition it deserved ) , fans of the show will be delighted with season four and if you are n't a fan , you should be . but do n't start with season four . go back and do it right . either buy or rent ( i recommend buying- -you 'll want to watch this more than once ) season one , then work your way forward . many pleasurable hours will result

books neg 19.txt the book jacket for " the ruins " offers a can't -miss premise : a group of post-grad american tourists at play in mexico jump at the chance for a little adventure among mayan ruins but find but then find themselves in unimaginable danger . it 's the stuff of great summer thrillers ready to be taken to the beach . but 319 pages later , the reader is left to wonder whether or not the publisher put the wrong book in the jacket . almost immediately , you 'll notice that smith 's writing is as dense as the jungles that make the setting . however , despite the endless stream of words , his descriptions are often threadbare . plus , there are no chapter breaks , which eventually pushes the pace until it feels like an assignment to continue . next , the characters themselves begin to fall flat . there are only really two couples to keep track of , and yet it 's difficult for the first third of the book to distinguish them . there is little to keep you interested in what they 're doing or why they might be doing it . smith 's attempts at developing these four as characters come in fits and spurts . this seems obviously haphazard and hurried - the author is jamming in backstory whenever needed to explain characters ' actions as if he were patching leaks in a dam . by the end of the book , the foursome seems to be as disinterested in each other as the reader is in them . and for the readers who are hoping to discover something of interest in the setting such as mayan mythology or archeological lore , forget it . aside from language barriers with the locals , there is no reason why this fantastical story could n't have been set in the wilds of the rocky mountains , the saharan desert , or anywhere else . the danger posed has nothing to do with mexico , archeology or mythology at all . ah yes , the danger posed . well , i ca n't say much at all because anyone could give away the entire book with one line of explanation - that 's how thin the plot is . the numerous other reviews that fault this as a short story masquerading as a novel are exactly right . suffice it to say that when you do realize what the danger is ( and you 'll realize it well before any of the well-educated characters do ) , it 's a real eye-roller , as if to say " i read this many pages for this ? " . by the time the story concludes , it 's more irritating than suspenseful . the characters take so long to blithely undertake any course of action at all that you 'll start rooting against them . eventually scenes of gore start piling up in an obvious and lazy attempt to interject some action , but even aside from being misdirected , it 's too little too late . this book could have been an adventure , a supernatural thriller , a survival tale , or a horror screenplay . it could have even taken the high road as an examination on people 's reactions to situations of extreme stress : some take the lead , even enjoying the challenge , while others whither into a shell of hopelessness . but none of the possibilities ever come to fruition in this disappointing effort .

music neg 474.txt my dj side : i actually had to stop the music , open the tray on the cd player then check whether i had the right cd1 down-tempo in , or some other cd that my wife played before as the music was so not what i was expecting , sounding more like deep forest than jvm . to my surprise , it was jimmy 's balance 10. i decided to keep an open mind and listen to it anyway . i went to sleep after the 4th track . the next day i decided to listen to the second cd ( mid tempo ) . again i stopped the music , opened the tray on the cd player then checked whether i had the ( mid tempo cd ) in instead of the down-tempo i was playing the night before . sure enough , the ( mid tempo ) was what i had in the player , but did not sound much different than the lullabies i was listening to on cd1. when the mid-tempo was over , i thought to myself " well , this would be very nice for an upcoming relaxing dinner with friends " . the next day i had high hopes for the up tempo cd , cause well , as the name implies , it should be where the beats and treats are . but no . not really . the only reason i did n't freak out from listening to the 1st and 2nd cd of jimmy van m 's balance release is because for three days i kept telling myself that there is an up tempo cd . i did n't mind cd1&2 out of place pop tracks , i did n't mind the different types of music being played in sequence , or rather , out of sequence . i did n't mind hotel lobby music that reminded me of a hotel i stayed in two years ago in vienna . all this will be forgivable when i hear the up-tempo , because i was so sure it 's going to be awesome . unfortunately , i was not quite right about my assumptions . things did not start happening until track 5 ( the reducer 2 ) , i do n't really need some 4 tracks on the third cd to get me warmed up . jimmy warmed me up for 37 tracks before that , in his down + mid-tempo crap . for the most part , this production of the balance series - especially the first 41 tracks in sequence - churned out some of the most lethargic , way too slow and boring music that could be described , at best , as lullabies for grown ups . as for the last 9 tracks of the up-tempo , it is actually - dare i say - decent enough , but way too late , and even worse , ended prematurely . it should have been re-arranged with tracks in reverse order on every cd to be as follows : ( cd3 ) up-tempo should have been ( cd1 ) renamed ( in the car from club to home ) , ( cd2 ) mid-tempo should have been renamed ( at home in the living room ) and finally ( cd1 ) down-tempo should have been ( cd3 ) renamed ( in your bedroom ) . this just makes more sense . the reason i say this is due to the disproportionate figures of dance tracks given to us ( 9 ) to the rest of the sleepy , mellow ones ( 41 ) . for example , chill out house almost always start with a faster track or two then goes on to be slower gradually . i have never come across a chill cd that opened with 10 fast tracks and ended with 03 slow ones , that 's not chill . jvm balance did exactly that ; took forever to ascend to a certain point , then crashed almost immediately . what gives ? half star for cd1 half star for cd2 3 stars for cd3 my human side : dance music is not the only type of beautiful music out there , duh ! jimmy made that very clear in this release . if you want to listen to a wide range of ( not bad ! ) music , then balance 10 is for you . dive in jvm selection of what he thinks makes us human ; expressions of the soul that goes beyond our daily necessities to survive . as a matter of fact , we do n't even need music ( or any type of arts for that matter ) to survive at all . still we listen to it , we crave it and for many people their livelihood depends on it . music can represent our feelings , desires and wishes , and with jvm deep forest like music here ( as i mentioned before ) i ca n't help but wonder if he is going through a certain period in his life where spirituality and oneness with the world is a priority . i think it shows .

books pos 322.txt it does n't sound like the people you list as reasons " not " to read this book , actually read " this " book . there is a big difference , in my opinion , of putting positive affirmations in your mind , versus a witch doctor . and quite honestly , it seems the positive affirmations could and should be used in " conjuction " with medical care . does it say anywhere in the book to forego medical care , because you will most definitely be healed ? no where . so in my opinion , one has to have a " sound " mind , and not view the book as a " cure all " for all the ills in life , but rather a positive way to " enhance " your life . it is just plain stupid to to avoid getting medical care , when you have a terminal illness , or any other illness for that matter . but according to what i gather from the book , you can use positive affirmations , and " believe " that you are getting well , to help keep yourself in a positive state , rather than filling your head with negative thinking that you will never get well . studies aside from this book have proven that a healthy and positive attitude and mental outlook , have done wonders for recovering patients , along with their medical care . your review did not address any of those people that read this book , because the two examples of people you list , it is apparent they did n't read the book either , ( not sure what compelled you to post here ? ) therefore you are not qualified , in my opinion , to critique this book , as they were using apparently some form of faith healing from a televangelist , did they prescribe drinking snakes blood , too ? anyway , this book in no way says to forgo medical treatment if you are sick , and those that do , probably wo n't be addressing their medical problem . can the positive affirmations and power of suggestion help you through your medical crisis ? i imagine it can , ( studies prove it can ) in addition to proper medical treatment . anyway , you might want to actually read the book , instead of making comments of what happened to " so and so " who did n't even read it or apply it , including yourself .

dvd pos 960.txt the hand of fear is not top-notch , all-time classic who . even producer philip hinchcliffe does n't like it very much . the only reason it was likely selected for dvd release over such classics as the seeds of doom or terror of the autons is probably because it 's sarah jane 's farewell story . many stories during the hinchcliffe / holmes years of who , sometimes referred to as the " golden age " of doctor who , sometimes referred as the " gothic horror period , " were based on movies . the seeds of doom was based on the day of the triffids . horror of fang rock was based on and then there were none . if not based on an actual film , many were " inspired " in general by the look and feel of the hammer horror films . the hand of fear was inspired by the hands of dr. orlac , the old horror film about the disembodied hand of a killer . the story starts out great , beginning with a fantastic in-joke . rock quarries were very frequently used in the program as they were easily accessible and somewhat looked like alien planets . here the doctor and sarah land in a rock quarry on earth , and sarah thinks they 're on an alien planet ! after an accident with a detonation , sarah finds eldrad 's hand , and starts saying she / he / it must live a lot . " eldrad must ! live " ( high note on " must " ) . she takes the hand to a nuclear power plant where it can start absorbing energy and regenerating . the story thus far is excellent , and sarah jane , possessed by eldrad , is genuinely creepy , though why she 's dressed as andy pandy i 'll never know . extremely effective is the scene were the power plant worker disappears with the hand into the core . also extremely effective is eldrad eerily searing through the metal door of the power plant 's core , and then slowly emerging . the show goes downhill quick once eldrad , doctor and co . head to eldrad 's planet . producer hinchcliffe said this was a bad shift and that it lacked a certain punch . i agree . for some reason , once eldrad is back on its home planet the story loses all its edge . furthermore , sarah 's farewell seems entirely forced . the hand of fear , overall , is still good stuff though , and is well worth owning . it is one of the few episodes that contains the cool version of the tardis interior . ( why they did n't stick with the awesome jules verne-ish interior i have no idea ! )

books neg 465.txt there is no doubt that antonia fraser 's " the journey " is written in the author 's usual wry , witty and highly engaging style ( although i must say that i never before heard of sex described as " lugubrious . " ) there is also no doubt that fraser has done a great deal to redeem marie-antoinette 's shredded reputation by accurately describing her as being compassionate to the hardships of the french people . the book is full of vivid detail which makes it very readable . however , i was disappointed to see that fraser resorts to many popular misconceptions . for one thing , why does fraser act like marie antoinette was the only princess to be sent away from home as a teenager to seal a dynastic marriage ? what about sophie of anhalt-zerbst ( catherine the great ) who was also a young stranger in a foreign land ? this sort of thing happened all the time - it was what being a princess was all about . i was glad that fraser did not fall into the myth of louis xvi 's impotence / phimosis and surgery and all that . she simplistically portrays him as being asexual , which was not true , because he told his aunt after consummating his marriage that he enjoyed " it . " but never has any other biographer subjected the reader to the spectacle of fersen and the queen fiddling with primitive prophylactics while consummating their grand passion . i must say , it is a first . fraser insists that marie antoinette slept with fersen for many years and yet gives no solid proof , while at the same time maintaining that she was a woman of high moral character . i usually do not think of a woman who is shared by both a lover and a husband as having a high moral character , but i guess fraser does . oh , well . it is such romantic fantasies that turn this book into more of a soap opera than a serious biography . i found it absurd when fraser insists that the tormented queen of france was ultimately a martyr for the cause of the socialism and democracy which the french people now enjoy . if the queen had had her way , her descendant would be reigning today , and that is just the reality of it . for a better study of marie antoinette 's relationship with her husband , i would recommend vincent cronin 's " louis and antoinette . " as for better biographies of the queen , let me join some fellow reviewers in the hope that the works of delorme and bertieres will soon be available in english
camera neg 286.txt this was the first digital camera i purchased . i am an adventurous person and wanted something that would stand up to my lifestyle . this camera was n't it . the good *it is compact , which is pretty convenient *it has several camera functions that have the potential to work well if you are techno-savvy . the bad *after snorkeling with it for 30 minutes , the camera leaked and broke . olympus replaced it , but only after my 2 month stay in costa rica was over . *the functions are unreliable and difficult to use . rarely if ever do i get them to work how i want . the pictures always need touched up afterwards , sometimes seriously . *the zoom sucks . do n't expect to get those awesome close ups they advertise unless you have some serious patience . *the image stabilization is a joke . you need a tripod or surgeons hands to take pictures that are n't blurry . *the user manual left me with a lot of questions
books pos 873.txt in self-hypnosis for women c . alexander and annellen simpkins have created an instrument , a book and cd combination tailored to both the novice and the familiar practitioner of hypnosis . the simpkins have masterfully crafted this guide to self-guidance weaving explanation and experience throughout the written and spoken words . provided are tools useful in addressing a wide array of events familiar to most on the journey of being human . while true to its title , self-hypnosis for women , offering examples of utilization directly fashioned to " experiences " idiosyncratic to women : menstruation , pregnancy , labor and delivery , and menopause , the title of this work belies its more universal " applicability " to components of life common to both women and men : self image ; pain management ; overcoming fear and anxiety , and finding personal balance . the book is prefaced with instructions on gaining the most benefit for individual readers . those who may wish to skip over the more basic instructions are advised to begin their journey in later chapters . those who are new to the practice of hypnosis , or enjoy viewing the history and techniques from others ' perspectives are offered just that in the earlier chapters . the story of hypnosis , and the modern history and research of hypnosis take the readers back to the early stages of identified systematic trancework , from mesmer , charcot and freud , to the contributions of hilgard , hull , and milton h . erickson ; they then procede to accompany the participant on the journey through current and future directions , including their own paths , on which they are about to embark . the simpkins define suggestion as " a process by which a stimulus is accepted and then transformed through unconscious processing into an action , experience , attitude or concept . ( p.45 ) " this presentation of suggestion sets the stage for an environment conducive to the development of a personal ability to self-guide . together , the book and cd promote the utilization of both conscious and unconscious processes as learning tools , assisting in the transformation from less popular emotions such as fear or sadness to components of life which offers guidance and assistance . specific hypnotic techniques , are explained , and accompanied by exercises which give the audience an immediate opportunity to begin experiencing and tailoring that procedure . the framework for these exercises is the suggestion of an " experiment " with that particular technique , creating an environment for the learner to safely attempt each new activity with no possibility of failure . the only opportunity not offered is that of incompetence . there is only a place to try , adjust , and retry each experiment until the reader fashions their own skill set based on personal significance and comfort . more than a " bonus " the accompanying cd is a work of art on its own . again , mixing explanation with experiential learning , this auditory tool incorporates fractalization as a teaching method , to assist the listener in entering and returning from graduated levels of trance exploration . a vast canvas is provided , upon which the hypnotic partner can create motor , auditory and visual experiences with encouragement and assistance , rather than direction or interference , a respectful approach not always found in " self-hypnosis " recordings . sharon mclaughlin ma , managing editor , milton h . erickson newsletter

books pos 173.txt carlton mellick the 3rd 's " punk land " ( a pseudo-sequel to his 2001 novel " satan burger " ) wastes no time in getting straight to the story . it is set in an alternate heaven for punks , where sid vicious is god and you are judged for entry not by st. peter but rather a number of gate attendants who decide whether or not you are punk enough . mellick 's trademark off-beat humor and sideways take on religion is ever-present , along with a slew of philosophical ideas mixed with a juvenile sense of mischief . although it is a sequel , it stands completely on it 's own . fans of satan burger will appreciate the references and the continued story of nan and mortician , but new readers are n't left wondering about a back story . and anyone with even a slight interest in punk rock or punk culture will be in well , punk heaven , with all the references to punk history and culture and appearances by icons including g.g. allin , henry rollins , and johnny rotten . the book is also full of illustrations , diagrams , photos and lists , which help to give it a wonderful multimedia type feel . you 'll find yourself torn between finishing the paragraph you 're in and jumping directly over to the flier for the " pbr pogo joust " advertised on the next page . this is a great book , a sublimely goofy sort of work that is effortlessly good but never takes itself too seriously . highly recommended for anyone who likes mellick 's work , but even more so for anyone who has never read any of his books . this is a great place to discover the works of a young , groundbreaking author who is only getting better with time

camera neg 872.txt i have been searching on line and elsewhere for a good camcorder as 1 ) a replacement for my jvc gr-d70u , which died , and 2 ) to go online with a video blog . after much study and evaluation , i chose the canon zr800 based on a salesman 's recommendation , frustration as to the number of choices which are available , and the presence of an external microphone jack ( which was one of my " must-have " options ) . after returning home , i read the review by miamian " new reviewer " , and felt trepidation . after charging the battery , i tried the camera . lo and behold , miamian is right . there is an obvious noise when recording , which was not present in my jvc . hoping against hope , i played the tape back , and , just as i feared , the tape had a pronounced hiss . this is not just tape hiss , but a much more pronounced noise , which transfers to the tv when watching . it rendered the camcorder totally unacceptable . i took the camcorder back , and , like miamian , ordered the sony dch-hc38. ( i know , it does n't have an external microphone jack , but after all this confusion , i give up ! ! why do n't they make more cameras with them ? ? ) the plus signs of this camera are that its menu is much more intuitively laid out , and selection of the desired item does not even require looking at the instruction book . the joystick selector is so easy to use , to select play , rewind , fast forward , stop , pause in the playback mode , and is also is used to select various menu items in other modes . the wide screen viewfinder ( lcd ) is so nice to use , and easy to see , all others ( in 4:3 ) become passe' . i did n't have any chance to evaluate other aspects of the camera , due to the unacceptable noise which demanded rejection of the unit . the picture looked ok ; it did not greatly impress me , however , and the automatic focus appeared to be slow and very noticeable in playback . in essence , caveat emptor ; especially if you 're hard of hearing . others watching and listening to the tape will not be

music pos 431.txt sometimes , debut albums present an artist in full bloom , with an assured grasp on their sound and message . sometimes , debut albums are nothing but promise , pointing toward what the artist could do . public enemy 's gripping first album , yo ! bum rush the show , manages to fill both categories : it 's an expert , fully realized record of extraordinary power , but it pales in comparison with what came merely a year later . this is very much a rick rubin-directed production , kicking heavy guitars toward the front , honing the loops , rhythms , and samples into a roar with as much in common with rock as rap . but , damn if they do n't sound like they 've already conquered the world ! already , there is a tangible , physical excitement to the music , something that hits the gut with relentless force , as the mind races to keep up with chuck 's relentless rhymes or flavor flav 's spastic outbursts . and if there does n't seem to be as many classics here - - " you 're gonna get yours , " " miuzi weighs a ton , " " public enemy no . 1 " - - that 's only in comparison to what came later , since by any other artist an album this furious , visceral , and exciting would unquestionably be heralded as a classic . from public enemy , this is simply a shade under classic status

camera neg 550.txt downside : 1. i 'll have to add my complaint to several others who had the same problem . the camera suddenly stopped working after nearly 18 months of having no problems . i switched batteries...let it set for some time without batteries or memory card in it...nothing is getting it to work . on top of that i now have a memory card with photos on it that i ca n't transfer to my computer without a working camera to do that . 2. not good with indoors pictures especially if you try the " night " mode . if you use that mode , even with a tripod , keep your subjects to still-lifes , only...if you photograph people and they happen to move even the slightest , they will at best be blurry , at worst they will look like double exposures . 3. indoors pictures set at normal mode , with or without flash , are no better and may even be worse than your standard cheap 35mm camera . upside : 1. through its usb cable , it booted right into apple 's iphoto software making the organizing and editing of photos that i took a breeze . 2. outdoors , with plenty of sunlight , gave me near-perfect pictures that got a lot of praise . kodak did well with this aspect of the camera 's ability , given the price . 3. we won this camera ( free ) so for me it 's almost all upside...except now i have to shell out $$$ for a good camera ( that will hopefully read my current memory card

books neg 500.txt while " talk to the hand " is inescapably mediocre in comparison to " eats , shoots & leaves " , a book i found amusing , though not up-to-par to its new york times bestseller status , this book does have its moments . however , i was uterrly bloody appalled at the rudeness of lynne truss in presuming to make a comment that , despite whatever way she meant it , ended up sounding like she thought gluten intolerance was a choice . i find it interesting that she , or at least her editors , did not further investigate the disease ( which , indeed , gluten tolerance is ) before publishing such a degrading remark . oh , yes , bloody well sorry , ms. truss , for invading your rude , stay-home-and-bolt-the-door causitive world with yet another irritation which , i 'm sure , someone created just so you would have to sit in a restaurant and listen to someone else get special treatment for a fad diet . let 's just go and , well , obliterate a genetic disorder ! while we 're at it , we might as well just make the lactose intolerant drink milk . if it pleases and thanks you , ms. truss , we celiacs will eat cake . ( oh , bloody hell , did i just say " please " ? ) despite the fact that lynne truss makes this world out to be such a horribly rude place , i have to wonder if she 's experiencing the effects of projection . in explaining how rude we humans are , it was necessary for her to be quite rude , as well . it is not simply the celiac remark to which i refer : i also found her supermarket incident , in which a kid shouts at his mother , " i want that one , you effing bitch ! " , among others , a bit offensive . as a member of both the gluten intolerant community and the younger generation so responsible for this rudeness , i was often thoroughly appalled by this book . no , my friends and i do n't usually hold doors for each other , but , in general , i thank and get thanked in return for a money lend or a coffee downtown . frankly , i find myself more often in the perpetual motion of manners with my friends , as well as strangers , than in a cycle of rudeness which includes swearing for the sake of swearing and no regard for others . i can safely say that all of my friends ignore their cell phones if we are having a conversation , or , if they must answer , they apologize profusely before going outside to talk so they do not offend the people around them . i have to argue that we are not a select group . in today 's world , one sees what one expects to see ; one is treated as one expects to be treated . ms. truss , i believe , would find that perahps if she simply lowered her expectations slightly and gave out all the respect she possibly could , she would be surprised to find that , when people are rude , she cares less because she knows that she , at least , is doing her best not to be . if she did this , maybe she would be less likely to jump all over people who are rude because she would not be so worried about her own behavior . my last complaint is this : " gluten crap " ? you would think that such a sophisticated , eloquent ( as she is dedicated to proving ) person as lynne truss would have been able to find a better word to describe gluten than the third-year , am-i-not-so-cool-and-bitchin ' ( ? ) style word " crap .

books pos 197.txt first off , i loved the book cover - spine and all- - one of my all time favorites . it 's what first attracted me to this book amongst the other forward-facing covers on the store 's front table . then the title , i loved that just as much . both share the characteristics of being straightforward , to the point , and revealing . both are perfectly simple . i read most the essays and came to think that a . this guy really does his homework and b. he has a vocabulary more voluminous than the decimal numbers of pi . i constantly begged for my dictionary . it 's probably what gets him the press i knew before i picked this up : an intellectual snob . i guess he got that from the oprah incident . but i also guess that there 's lots of worse name calling that can happen to anyone in their career . what 's up with this culture that it 's so unacceptably horrible to be labeled an intellectual snob and so enviously warming to be called a pop culture icon ? the attraction to franzen 's work is that he investigates and reveals - in a binary way : he 's researching facts , he 's listening to feelings ; he 's processing both to give an opinion . the best example of this is my father 's brain in which he relates the alzheimer induced decomposing of his father 's brain . there is lots about the history and science of memory in this essay ; as much as there is about how a family discovers and lives with its loss . reading it you sympathize , you empathize and you learn . equally as insightful are : lost in the mail - a look into possible reasons behind chicago 's underperforming mail system the reader in exile - a great reflection on the intellectual and emotional fruits of reading first city - a historical and pensive piece about what pulls us towards cities meet me in st. louis - a piece that shares the two-sided feelings in a trio of situations ( including the oprah incident ) .

camera neg 326.txt i 'm a diehard nikon fan . my first nikon was a gift from my father when i was 13. since then , photography has been a serious hobby , having had a few photos published and even spent time working in a photo lab while in college . having said that , and after reading several reviews about people having trouble focusing this camera , i absolutely agree with them . someone responded by saying those reviewers have n't read the manual . baloney . i bought the coolpix l1 to replace a 4 year old coolpix 850. the l1 's camera 's focus feature works fine in the daylight and works for s**t indoors , especially with the macro settings . i 've been patient and have given it three months . i am fed up . this camera is going back to amazon in the morning

software pos 796.txt it installed without any problems . it runs without any problems . i am very happy with it . i am a convert from microsoft money . i am self employed and have one employee . my wife is also self-employed . we have twenty different financial accounts ( investment accounts , retirement accounts , checking accounts , savings accounts , a mortgage , a home equity line of credit and credit cards ) . we often pay business expenses with our personal credit card , as the credit card gives us frequent flyer miles for every purchase . quicken 2007 home and business allows us to do our personal accounting and business accounting all in one program , which makes it much easier . the one step update ( automatic downloading of our transactions and balances from financial institutions ) works with 17 of our 20 accounts . downloading data from the other 3 accounts requires some manual steps , but is still fairly painless . i like the online backup feature . it is inexpensive ( you pay a small annual charge ) and easy to use . i am not very impressed with the investment analysis features , although i have not yet fully explored them . i would like to be able to compute realized and unrealized annualized rates of return for individual positions or groups of positions , and it does n't seem like i can do that in this program .

books neg 874.txt if we are to draw equivalent lessons from both the prague spring and street protests in the u.s. , as kurlansky attempts in this book , the connection should depend on more than that they simply occured in the same year . the reader is owed specifics , yet is rewarded with little more than vague platitudes . prague was a protest against a government which not only lacked representation and dissent , but prohibited it . chicago et al were protests against decisions made by a representative government , however flawed , resulting from open debate . a bigger difference could hardly be imagined . but kurlansky does see striking differences , albeit only in the post-1968 world . the soviet bloc began it 's decent to oblivion , while the capitalist west avoided the same . his disappointment in the latter is not hard to glean , though what manner of " revolution " he envisions is never rendered to specifics , likely for good reason . but who needs details when false equivalencies and empty platitudes will do

books pos 281.txt this book still does not address many areas i find interesting in james brown 's career but i find it a natural companion to the three other jb books in my collection : cynthia rose 's " living in america : the soul saga of james brown " ; geoff brown 's biography " james brown " ; and ofcourse , the brown / tucker " the godfather of soul - james brown " . all three dig deep into this metaphysical musician 's mind but this one has a stronger narrative , a bit less guarded : his late ' 80s fall is described in a more contrite way , for example . his scientific study of his audience is perhaps something new in his dialogue - but he broaches the subject of how music motivates women in a different way than it does men , then immediately moves on to the next thought . even by 2005 standards his live albums contain some of the most overt sexuality , obviously directed at the female fans , ever recorded . similarly , his admonitions to admonishes contemporary rap / hip-hop artists are eloquent but must be deemed a bit self-righteous : there is alot of " adult " content in his catalogue which ca n't be explained away as " art " . however , fans can trace his development into more " cerebral " music , with more and more sensitive ballads and socially-conscious tunes being produced from the late ' 60s on . i was happy to read his description of little richard 's assistance in his early career , but a bit disheartened when he suggested that penniman was basically a rock and roll raver - i find it hard to believe that this publication brought out his true feelings about his georgia neighbor - the influence is quite obvious and not just on " chonnie on chon " . another depressing ommission is with marva whitney , his popular lead female vocalist from c . '67 to ' 70. a recent documentary reveals that marva traveled to vietnam with the star but here he simply says that he was only allowed to travel with a small part of his musical backup . despite the above concerns , with this book james brown has shown the literary world that he is a writer . ofcourse this was obvious to the musical world - just listen to " do n't be a drop out " , " i do n't want nobody to give me nothing " , " the man in the glass " , " i 'm not demanding " , " it 's christmas time " , and " peace in the world "

dvd pos 919.txt robert redford has proved us his undeniable artistic gifts in previous occasions , but with this giant movie he really achieved that coveted pearl ; the state of art in all its wholeness . redford crossed over the traditional concessions and he got to prove art and cinema should not be divorced : good taste and profitability may gather and shake hands , if you respect the sensibility and intelligence of the spectator . this picture not only broke the walls and not only became the most ambitious , artistic and perfect american film in the last quarter of century ; besides , the mature and sensitive script around an awful event that will transform the livings and expand the reduced frontiers of two different ways of life , enhancing them when the tragedy became an unexpected gate for the bliss . redford ' s artistic personality has a secure place in the immortality and i really hope for him to bring us future films filled of that enriched vision where the rude vulgarity , the visible special effects big circus and the simple anecdote not only be absent ; and so the new directors to come , understand the true cinema meaning is art . thanks to his generous personal effort , for having created the sundance festival for new directors whose fruits will create new approaches and major visions . special kudos to him due that clinical eye for a very young actress in progress at those years : scarlet johansson .

( i write mostly for the web , and use pictures to accompany my reviews and articles- -as well as for ebooks . ) i have n't done any extensive work with it yet , but it appears easy to use if you have experience with picture it ! if you 've never used any image program before , it may be a bit confusing . ( i feel that picture it ! was more self-explanatory . ) however , for all that the works suite gives you , i feel it 's a good buy . word 2002 has advantages over the older version ( for example , you can easily insert images ) , and encarta may be helpful for kids doing homework ( or curious adults wanting to learn more about something ) . updating encarta is easy as clicking a mouse : just open up the program and click " update encarta " . new articles and updates will automatically be added to your computer . although i *still* do n't use streets and trips ( i go to mapquest reflexively ) , i still think this is a great suite for a great price
music pos 15.txt there is a saying in the construction industry " tripping over dollars to pick up nickels . " or in the regular world " ca n't see the black forest for the trees . " i doubt if there is an definitive rendition of all of beethoven 's symphonies . even the composers own conducted versions changed over time and from performance to performance depending on the players or his intentions . instruments were constantly changing and you know this guy was never satisfied , always stretching . we can only guess what his exact intentions would be today or tomorrow . what you want to remember is : 1 ) the first version of anything you seriously like will color your listenings of subsequent versions . you 'll be listening for qualities that are n't there and missing qualities that are there . 2 ) different versions bring us different views . is n't that a good thing ? sound in all it 's forms is preferable than a useless search for the best sound . i 'd rather have that kind of an attitude than the bickering negative perfectionist snob attitudes of some of the reviewers here . having said that.. . i love these versions . i 've had them for some time . i have at least 4 versions of the symphonies . these are clear , well recorded , dynamic and straight forward . beethoven 's passion , mental range and personal warmth are within . you can easily hear the information that beethoven wanted you to hear . probably better than he could . no make that clearly better than he could . ha ha ! these are solid , lovely , beautiful , and astounding . listen to them

health pos 590.txt i have not been overweight for many years , but i still have that last 5-10 pounds that just will not stay off . i have several issues with eating - i tend to eat very large portions when i am really enjoying a meal , i snack a lot , and i have a major sweet tooth . this product has taken care of all 3 problems . i am currently taking 1000 mg 3 times a day . i plan to cut back a little once i 'm at my target weight . i find that this dosage will generally suppress my appetite and / or urge to eat for 3-6 hours . it 's odd for me to experience hunger without cravings and a frantic urge to eat...but that 's what the pills do for me . most of the time i can tell i 'm hungry only because my stomach is growling and it has been several hours since my last meal...but i do n't feel like i have to eat anything right away . i can go grocery shopping when i 'm hungry and not make poor choices , and even when i finish up at the gym after work i do n't feel ravenous anymore . i definitely get full faster . it does n't feel like it used to when i overate , i just can tell i 've eaten enough and i stop . what a concept ! and often i can just have a bite or two and be good for another 30-60 min if i 'm too busy to sit down and eat . my urge to snack has really been curbed . i still have one or two snacks most days , but they are much smaller and often more healthy . now i can actually stay up several hours past dinner without making another mini-meal , which i used to do almost every night . hoodia does not completely kill my appetite , it suppresses it quite a bit but more than anything it takes away all of my cravings . that is definitely my favorite part - i used to crave sugar from morning until night practically every day . since my first day on these pills , the only time i 've had sweets is when someone has offered me something . i 'm able to eat just a little and not wish for ten times more . it does not occur to me to go to the vending machine at work anymore , or buy candy when i 'm shopping . maybe even more than the weight loss , the emotional benefits of these pills are incredible for me . i 'm no longer berating myself constantly for overeating or having too much candy or dessert . i 'm not depressed all day anymore because my favorite pants have gotten snug , and all i can think about is why i do n't have the willpower to prevent it . i would definitely recommend this product , especially to anyone who has issues with food like i do

dvd pos 495.txt i mean that statement in two ways . first , in my humble opinion , this is martin scorcese at his finest . this is better than goodfellas by a wide margin . all of the regulars give awesome performances in this ( even sharon stone , who i ca n't stand ! ) . if you like mafia pictures , this is the best one to own . i also mean that it 's a great picture due to the fact that it 's on hd-dvd . the picture is astonishingly vivid and clear and the lights of las vegas really jump out of the television . it 's almost 3-d ! the extras are ample , but i 'd say adequate . that 's the reason i give it 4 stars instead of 5. there is the obligitory commentary , deleted scenes , and a couple featurettes . it 's all whipped cream and a cherry on top of an excellent sundae ! i do like that you can watch the extras and the movie at the same time with commentary running . this and batman begins are the reasons you should own an hd dvd player ! note : i have the hd dvd drive attached to my xbox 360 and it works brilliantly !
software pos 6.txt nobody , and i mean nobody , could be more of an illustrator novice & ignoramus than i . several months ago i was given a licensed copy of illustrator 9 that a departing coworker had used . wanting a chance to design the departmental logo that otherwise would 've gone to an agency , i raised my figurative hand and volunteered blindly for duty . having taught myself everything from ms-dos to turbocad , to photoshop elements , not to mention word , excel , and powerpoint ( do n't get me started on that latter program , argh ) , i figured i could tackle at least the basics of illustrator 9. loaded it on my laptop , took it home for a weekend....and just about lost my sanity - - and several fingernails - - trying to learn that confounding program . i managed to produce a few logos , one of which was chosen . but egads , what a big , stinky bear illustrator 9 was to wrestle . when i saw that cs2 had this live trace feature , i pleaded with my workplace santa to get it for me , and wow ! what an overall improvement ! ! illustrator will still not be as intuitive to pick up as an ms office product , but this comes darn close . with cs2 , they 've given us " hot tips " - - little clues about what some of the tools do , that pop up when you mouse over the tool . the intuitive menus are nice too . also cool is that all the text & paragraph and fill & stroke features , which used to be huge boxes taking up valuable real estate on the screen , are now condensed up on a small horizontal toolbar , like in the office products ... and when you mouse over them , the screen tips tell you how to expand them . aaaahh ! finally some help for dunces like me . live trace and live paint are unbelieveably cool . the very first thing i did after loading cs2 was to grab a .jpg photo of a soccer ball off google images , and within 20 minutes , without consulting any book or online help , i 'd converted it into a simple graphic image painted into the 2 colors i wanted . but as for a great guidebook , the reviewer who suggested illustrator visual quickstart guide by elaine weinmann was dead-on . i 've bought several other " highly rated " books to try to help me through the confounding quagmire of adobe products , so i 've seen them all . the visual quickstart book does n't have any of that insufferable " wanna-be-a-comic-novel-author " writing , and focuses just on the basics . and it 's very literal , with step-by-step instructions . still there 's no substitute for the utterly excruciating process of learning illustrator through experience . but the weinmann book 's better than any i 've seen yet . the only reason i have n't given this product a 5 is because it still does n't have the intuitiveness that it needs . in that way it 's still " snobby " - - aimed at pros , not folks like me who need to do occasional design stuff but not for a living . but this is a far , far , far cry better than illustrator 9. absolutely worth the money , just for live trace and live paint alone .

books neg 417.txt having read a few bosch books already ( the closers and lost light ) , i realized that i should probably start at the beginning to get better insight on how bosch became the bosch i was reading in the later series . however , i was very disappointed with this book . one of the most irritating aspects of this book was the grammatical errors ( mispellings and such ) . i found 3 or 4 in the first 50 pages ( before i stopped reading ) ! i thought it was ironic that connelly was thanking his editor at the beginning of the book , because it did not seem that anyone was editing this book . also , i found the book to be too gritty . it lacked the emotion and soul that i found in the later books . it seemed that connelly was trying too hard to make bosch fit this certain mold , but then transformed the character to be more likeable in the later books that i read . so it was disappointing that this book could not hold my interest because i just finished reading the narrows and loved it , and will probably pick up some other bosch books and just read it out of order . connelly 's writing seems to be getting better and better , which should explain why i did n't enjoy this book and could n't finish it . i gave it 2 stars because it might have gotten better and maybe i was too impatient . this is one of those series that seems like it is better to read out of order

books neg 277.txt the literature of september 11 is never attacked . when a book speaks of september 11 ( or of terrorism in general ) , it is more or less guaranteed immunity from criticism ; it will almost inescapably be greeted with sympathy . jonathan safran foer 's extremely loud and incredibly close banks on such sympathy , on such reverence . the narrative , which concerns a nine-year-old boy named oskar schell in search of a key that would unlock / unshell the enigma of his dead father ( a narrative stolen , in its basic outline , from guenther grass 's die blechtrommel ) , could have been written entirely without its scattered references to the terrorist interventions . nor is this trauma the only one presented in the novel : the others include hiroshima / nagasaki , the staten island ferry crash , and the dresden bombings . each disaster is generalized to the point at which what is addressed is not a traumatizing event in its specificity , but historical " trauma " itself and the overcoming of trauma through bereavement-inspired creation . oskar , the insufferable brat , attempts to complete the work of mourning for his father , thomas schell , jr. , a victim of september 11 , by compiling an almanac of self-inflicted wounds , the collage of images and letters which is the book we are " reading " - --an almanac which , most likely , is written sometime in the indefinite future ( thomas shell , sr. 's manuscript of 4 / 12 / 78 is heavily edited ( pp . 208-216 ) . who has done the editing ? almost certainly an older version of his grandson oskar ) . if the term , " reading " even applies . whenever a " pregnant " image is described , foer literally re-presents it in the form of a pictorial image . when a flock of birds rises into the sky , it is not enough that we read of these birds- --we must see them as well . words may not be left in their invisibility ; we are presented with supplementary photographs , illustrations , since mere verbality is not enough . ( indeed , the entire novel oozes with misologos - - - the mistrust or hatred of language - - - in terms of both its content and its form . ) photographs , yes , and also a superabundance of blank pages and nearly blank pages . space is not used in the manner it is in the works of edmond jabes , for instance . typography does not substitute for a well-wrought sentence . foer abrogates himself of all responsibilities - - - most specifically , the responsibility to write well . why bother when the pyrotechnics of typography are at his disposal ? as far as the writing is concerned , it is composed of nothing other than mind-numbingly , soul-deadeningly repetitive phrases ( " heavy boots , " " raison d'etre , " etc. ) and sunday school platitudes : " sometimes one simply wants to disappear " ( 184 ) ; " there 's nothing wrong with not understanding yourself " ( 184 ) ; " everything that 's born has to die , which means our lives are like skyscrapers " ( 245 ) ; " how can you say i love you to someone you love ? ... it 's always necessary " ( 314 ) . whenever the author writes something that he finds " beautiful " and " true " ( 165 ) , he congratulates himself on his brilliance and tells us that that thing is " beautiful " and " true . " the entire book reeks of such unearned profundity . we also learn that most dust is made up of human detritus- --a very deep truth indeed , one that foer also communicates in his essay , " emptiness " ( originally published in playboy ) with all of the sanctimoniousness and self-righteousness of the faux naif who serves as the center of the novel , a sunday school lecture in which we learn that famous musicians ( ringo star ) and scientists ( stephen hawking ) are unthreateningly approachable : everything is familiarized . perhaps it is wrong to criticize foer for including so many blank pages in extremely loud and incredibly close , since the entire book is a vacuum : null space into which readers may project their own meanings . joseph suglia , ph.d . , the author of watch out

dvd neg 670.txt this edition of the film sucks and sucks again . the wide screen version of this is a masterpiece - without the widescreen ratio this edition cannot be true to the comic book sensibility that bava intended . each shot was carefully composed ( and not intended to be butchered ) - this edition is a travesty - - especially when it 's purported to be put out by fans - do you 're homework . there are also scenes missing from this print , scenes that are important and add to the overall ambience . hey i thought the folks behind this were enthusiasts - - instead its just sloppy and self indulgent . look for the earlier laser disc edition ........... as for the extras do we really need the - it 's great because i used it in my video slop .... and it 's great because i did a bad homage / rip-off slop . the documentary in the extras takes great pains to point out that this film was intended to look like a comic book and that 's what was great about it . then when you watch the film what you get is less than a third of the original image ! strikes me a total scumminess . all in a all a fabulous opportunity wasted ... by a few lazy lard-asses with a quick-fix mentality .

camera neg 817.txt i 've just returned this unit . it does n't play videos as advertised . i was able to get it to properly play .avi files at 320 x 240 resolution...see other review below . but 320x240 gives a postage stamp size picture . at 640 x 480 the playback was full size but jerky and broken....more later . i have now had 3 different brands of 8 " photo frames in my possession : a phillips , a pandigital , and this coby . i have developed the following list of features in my " ideal " photo frame . first , video playback : i 've been taking a lot of video clips with my digital still camera...they come out well and the convenience of not having to lug my camcorder along , and the ability to quickly transfer clip files within / between chips and my computer is attractive . i would like a frame which will play the format my camera is taking ( .mov , more later ) i 'd also like the frame to play a multi-media show...that is , to play movie clips in show presentations , intermixed with .jpg photo files . second feature is to play .wma music files , in addition to mp3. this is because i have a non-ipod personal music player . all my music is in .wma format because it is roughly half the file size of mp3. third , i would like a timer on my frame...set it to come on in the morning , off at night , for example . fourth , i 'd like an audio or speaker out feature . none of these frames has home theater-like sound , and i have an extra pair of computer speakers i 'd probably hook up . video out could come in handy too . fifth , i 'd like to be able to rotate stills from within the frame 's software , manually or automatically . yes , you can rotate them in the computer , but the frame may or may not preserve the rotation . ( this may depend on which photo edit program you are using . ) sixth , i 'd like a folder hierarchy file management system in the frame 's software . especially with the huge chips now available , i see an advantage to push a couple of buttons and change the picture set ( folder ) , rather than switching out chips . here is where the 3 units i 've had stack up , followed by my next ( fourth ) unit . i am keeping the pandigital....which costco has for $140. it plays .mov video files , but not within a slideshow . it has no speaker out jack and the sound is tinny . it requires mp3 music files . it permits picture rotation . no folder management system . no clock / timer . no ability to play stills / video intermixed . i think the coby and phillips picture quality is brighter but the pandigital is ok . the phillips did n't play video , and since it also had a software glitch when i returned it i decided to look elsewhere . ( no remote and no music with the philips either . ) the coby wo n't play my videos , even after i used my converter program to try about 10 different mp4 and avi variations . the coby plays .wma music files , wo n't rotate stills , has no folder system , no clock / timer . it has a speaker out jack . it does not permit intermixing video and stills in one multimedia show . picture quality is fully equal to philips , generally the recognized standard . if all you want is photos , and never turn your camera sideways , this unit will be a good value . another unit i 'd like to get to play with would be the image moments model by digitalfoci . i 've exchanged emails with someone there who clearly knows what they are talking about and i believe this unit will intermix my photos and videos .

books neg 883.txt what this is : an epic adventure . it would be imappropriate to review the wot series when speaking of the prophesies of the dragon book ; it 's also not really a supplement akin to , say , the monster manual for d&d- -the only extra skills , feats , backgrounds , etc are those directly related to npcs in the campaign . what prophecies is designed to do is take a party of characters through their first six levels of adventuring , which correspond roughly to the first six books of the series of novels . the players are allowed to play a key behind the scenes role in the story of the novels and cameos have been scripted for many of the book 's key characters . it 's a really ambitious undertaking ; players have to be given a compelling storyline , feel like they 're making a difference in a campaign that covers over a year of game time , without letting them change what happens in the novels . does it work ? i am currently gming this adventure . on paper , it looks really good . some of the scenes , especially in the later parts of the story , look exciting , moving even . faile 's cameo is perfect , for example . in practice , though , it 's been an extremely frustrating experience . first , the early encounters ( as pointed out by another reviewer ) are unnecessarily difficult and add nothing to the plot . as things progress , the authors presume too much on the goals and motivations of the players . there is one chapter , for example , where the introduction says something along the lines of , " upon entering the city , the players will want to find ( a certain npc ) as soon as posible and will definitely want to investigate the actions of ( another npc ) . " the players in my campaign knew they wanted to talk to one of these guys eventually , but the other one was off their radar completely . throughout , i 've had to improvise ways to keep them approximating the plot line of the campaign and by chapter 3 , they 're feeling very manipulated . the campaign assumes the party wants to do nothing more than hunt down dark friends and expose evil plots and will take great personal risk and go through great hardship ( including , at one point , a monthlong trek through a winter wilderness without adequate provisions ) on the chance of thwarting same . characters with any other motivations ( say , a character modeled after mat or nynaeve in the books ) will feel forced into situations unnaturally . there has been more than one point where one of the players saying , " i *think* this is where the plot wants us to go . " so , in conclusion , while this adventure is excellent in its dreams and scope- -and it 's definitely better than something i could have designed myself- -but it will fail often fail as a game . if you are intending to run a wot campaign , buy this adventure , read it so that you thoroughly understand its scope before you even let your players make up characters . the characters need to be created to fit the story or the story wo n't work

books neg 71.txt one of the spotlight reviewers says that by combining two great characters- -sunny randall and jesse stone- -robert b . parker has doubled our fun . quite the reverse . he has cut it in half . the characterizations of sunny and jesse are enormously feeble ; and the the rest of the characters are no great shakes , either . sunny 's irish mafia uncle is a cardboard cutout . suitcase simpson has three funny lines and is heard from no more . the villains- -buddy , erin , missy , gerard , moon- -are little more than vague names and stereotyping . spike is relegated to a scene and a half . oddly , the only interesting character is a very minor one : eddie . but he only stays around for 10 minutes even the plot is tissue-thin . the love-story is lame ; the sex-scenes boring . worst of all , who should appear but ( christ ! ) susan silverman , from the spenser series : one of the dampest and most wooden and least interesting characters in fiction . as with " cold service " and some others , parker is just coasting with this one . he is capable of far better .

books neg 470.txt i personally do not see how this book could have won a newbery medal . while the author portrays sibling rivalry effectively , that is about the only positive aspect of this book . the fact that the teenage girl protagonist has a crush on an elderly man is disgusting and is presented as not only being acceptable but understandable . sara 's family is also unsupportive to her sulky and jealous attitudes . her grandmother is a busybody and consantly antagonizes the family . sara 's twin sister gets all the attention and love , leaving sara starving for parental care . finally , christianity is portrayed as harsh and judgemental . this book could possibly be acceptable for adults but never for children and i would not recommend it to anyone . i wasted my time with this book : please do n't waste yours .

dvd pos 760.txt eddie and rose are meant to be in nicole savoca 's " dogfight . " this is a warm and wonderful movie ; those of us who have seen it have an obligation to spread the word to as many others as we can . it 's sad that so few people have heard of or seen dogfight . how a film that was so universally well liked by viewers and critics managed to completely slip under the radar of popular attention is a mystery to me . many others have synopsized the story , so i wont be repetitive . i will say that this movie 's genius is in its acting . river phoenix and lili taylor have the chemistry of childhood friends , and it shows in scene after scene . river gives the most endearing performance of his career in this film as the affectedly coarse , absurdly young " jarhead , " eddie , about to ship out to vietnam . his coming of age is the narrative behind this movie , while rose 's idealism and grace throughout the humiliating ordeal of the " dogfight " make her character angelic . the poignancy of the closing scene , in which eddie embraces rose , in tears , after having lost his three best friends during the vietnam war will stay with you for a long time . dogfight is a unique and touching film . it harkens to a sensibility which is dissatisfied with much of the droll offered as " romantic " by hollywood today .
camera neg 35.txt i purchased this camera in august 2006 and have sent it out for repair 4 times already for the same problem and it is november 2006. kodak just keeps telling me to send it to get repaired . is that right ? it takes great pictures but when you try to download them to your computer it works the first time . you try to do it a second time and it freezes and gives you a cannot read device message . i have two kids and the most important thing is to send picture emails to all the relatives across the globe on their updated lives . i now have to go to my local photo place to get a cd and prints made and then download them into my easyshare software . oh , should n't it be easier after spending that much money on a camera . also , i had to purchase a dock adapter for my printer dock . when i put the camera on the dock , it does n't charge the battery or print pictures , the screen just goes grey . this camera has had its main board and firmware repaired and replaced every time that it has come back to me . the cost of shipping , cd 's and prints has just added to the headache this camera has given me . kodak has not been helpful at all and they inform me the only form of communication of through email . what are they afraid of , they need to face the problem and satisfy their customers . do not purchase this camera , it is a great if you just never want to get them out of the camera

dvd neg 269.txt this very b grade horror film left alot to be desired . aside from one blasemophous scene where the demon priest sucks on a crusifix to suggest oral sex , and a young man who has ripped open his shirt to carees his pecks sucks his crusifix , there wasnt much to make this unrated . if your expecting to see frontal or rear nudity , forget it ! the nearest thing is teenage guys running around in tight calvin klein undies . however , if your someone who likes to use your imagination , this might be for you . one good thing about this flick is a pre charmed hottie drew fuller rubbing himself all over in his undies . if your a big drew fan like me , it might be worth buying , utherwise go buy a playgirl

dvd neg 256.txt i really tried to come to this movie with and open mind . i 'm a huge fan of jane austen and i thought the 1995 bbc miniseries actually came close to doing justice to her novel . still , i was looking foreward to seeing a new interpretation . unfortunately this one seemed to miss the point of the story . jane austen had a hilarious way of satarizing the social conventions and mores while being in their midst . this film ignores the social conventions altogether and therefore misses a great deal of austen 's humor . for example an unmarried man and woman would never greet each other in their pajamas . a man would never visit his fiancee while she was lying sick in bed in her nightgown . when these rules of propriety are ignored by the film , how are we supposed to understand or believe that it 's a big deal when lydia runs away with wickham ! ? another example is lady catherine . this is a woman who lives and dies by her snobbery and rigorous adherance to social conventions . yet in this film we see her barge into the bennet household in the middle of the night and wake lizzie up to ask a question that could easily waited until morning ( when lady catherine would n't have had to get her carriage driver out of bed to drive several miles in the dark - no streetlights remember - to the bennet household ) because no one adhere 's to societies rigorous , and for the most part arbitrary , rules , the movie misses the opportunies to subtly wink at the audience as it laughs at such things . another weakness lies in the casting . granted these actors had big shoes to fill . colin firth and jennifer ehle seemed to embody their characters in the 1995 miniseries , but as i said , there are other ways to interpret and play the characters . unforunately here everyone seems as if they 're reading lines with dramatic inflection - not acting . you can almost imagine keira knightly 's script having notes saying " insert spunkiness here " . while the scenery is lovely , the windswept cliff and farm images seem to recollect the tortured landscape of a bronte adaptation more than a manacured austen setting . overall this film comes off as one big missed opportunity

books pos 71.txt this is a wonderful book , aimed at helping the struggling new mom with the all-too-often misunderstood post-partum depression symptoms . while i am thrilled that such a renowned star is willing to share her story for the benefit of others , i urge brooke shields to re-consider a comment she made recently . she indicated that while she knows now that post-partum depression is real and requires treatment of both medicinal and therapy support , ...she does not believe that adhd exists nor that it requires the same level of support . it is essential that such public figures realize that what they have experienced is not the only form of reality . thousands suffer with adhd in ways that interfere with their livlihood , schooling , relationships and self-esteem issues . studies have shown this challenge to be as real and as debilitating as post partum depression . so please , brooke...do n't deny the realities of other maladies , simply because you have n't experienced them . you of all people should realize how frustrating it is to have your challenges blown off by others . your " voice " is heard loudly . your message must be correct . thank you

dvd pos 896.txt i did n't give this five stars because it 's some kind of oscar-worthy achievement , but if you are a fan of the quirky , b-grade fantasy genre that had its heyday in the late seventies to late eighties , then this film is a must . " hawk " offers hilarious jump-cut editing , dialogue that is spectacular in its badness , and probably the most memorable elf character ever put to film . for all that , the film is also remarkable for its innocence , in a time when cheesecake t&a fantasy like " the sword and the sorceress " and the infamous " deathstalker " series were the norm , " hawk the slayer " keeps it clean , and is all the funnier for it . if you have the right sort of friends , then snap this gem up , invite them over for beer and pizza , and have a go . it 's more than worth it

dvd pos 828.txt this film harks back to a time when africentricity was woven into the psyche of the younger generation . blackness informed all of their life decisions and defined their aesthetic . this is definitely true of the younger generation in this film . another dynamic at play in this film is a sort of intergenerational upheaval . some members of the older generation were reconsidering their long held beleifs on what it meant to be black in america while the rest of the older generation stood firm staunchly defending their fossilized ideals . so if you 're in the mood to see a comedic family film with a post sixties revolutionary air view " five on the black hand side " and breathe in the culture

books neg 533.txt this book is poorly written and even more poorly edited . the back cover states ... " every subject is given background and basic exercises to allow beginners to figure it out . " it is a great statement , but it is unfortunately not true . page 6 : " so what formats can a script be saved as ? there are three main kinds of script files : regular compiled script , which is the native applescript file format , and scripts saved as plain text or as applications . on top of that , os x added a new option for saving compiled scripts and script applications called " bundle . " bundles are folders that appear and behave as files . you can read about them in chapter 23. " - i guess bundle is not a " main " format ? why is there a distinction between main formats and , for lack of a better term , minor formats ? i have no idea . page 35 : " every class has a super class . " page 40 : " we saw that objects belong to classes , and classes may have subclasses and super classes . " - which sentence is correct ? page 43 : " when you work with an application that does n't support the whose clause , you have to settle for slower , clumsier repeat loops . " - repeat loops are not explained earlier in the book . there is no reference on this page to the repeat loops that are explained extensively in chapter 11 , pages 321-343. i wanted to like this book , but i do not . i look forward to a revised first edition or new second edition of this book , because it does have potential to be great . however the next edition needs more polished writing and meticulous editing
books neg 768.txt i have an amazon bookmark that advertises ludlum 's book " the sigma protocol " . it says " in ludlum 's latest , an ordinary man battles a global conspiracy . " well gee . that 's the plot of this book as well . come to think of it , that 's the plot of every book by the man that i 've read . a ' vast right wing conspiracy ' is set to take over the world . they have small armies , a lot of money and a plan . this time around , a group of military men ( naturally ) plan to foment terror , and use the chaos to implement their vision of the world ( laugh not - millions in the middle east and far left believe 9-11 was something along the same lines ) . enter " ordinary man " joel converse . he 's a vietnam vet and p.o , w . who thought he had left that life far behind . it 's up to him to save the world . he will survive certain death several times ( the bad guys always seem to think they need him alive , and they just have to explain their conspiracy to this total stranger ) . he will find love , and he 'll visit several european cities to boot . of course , a suspension of disbelief is essential for many novels ( how else would you believe that a nazi and an israeli are on the same side ? ) , but ludlum 's cliched stories are further worsened by the fact that he just could n't write . his dialogue writing is always tedious , and sometimes just painful to read . action scenes are generic . the only thing he could do right is character background , but that 's not enough to save this . " the aquitaine progression " might make a half decent tv movie , but to endure 700 pages is just too much
dvd neg 352.txt i could barely get through the...um...er...reimagination...of the childern 's classic - while the set design and special fx are state of the art , as usual for a tim burton film , the actual movie is hard to watch . why ? depp 's " performance " is chock full of ticks and mannerisms , off-putting , flat , self-absorbed , and finally , one-note . rather than the quirky fun of the original 1972 gene wilder version , burton 's film is more horror than fantasy , often casually cruel and sadistic to the point of being far from family fare . while deliberate on burton 's part , that does n't make the final product any more watchable . it 's one grim , dismal , downward spiral slog . not much holidday fun , huh ? as with most of burton 's other big , expensive failures , he knows how to create a convincing world , but has no clue how to populate it with characters and situations we identify with and / or could care less about . the final result is a film that 's like a fragile , hermetically sealed curio on the shelf - nice to look at from afar , but hard to get attached to , much less involved with . what a waste of millions of studio $$$

dvd pos 83.txt fast times at ridgemont high is a clever , insightful , and wicked film ! it is not just another teen movie , though to the casual observer it might be . no , it is a time capsule into the socal lifestyle that pervaded much of the films of the late 70 's and 80 's as well as it is a time capsule into the mindset of teenagers all over the u.s. circa 1982. sean penn ( whom i 'm not a big fan of ) as jeff spicoli is truly inspired ! i find myself to this day trying to imitate his dead on surfer takes . what an awesome character . when he says , " you d*ck ! " to ray walston 's mr. hand ( another inspired and forever memorable character ) , you just wanna roll on the floor ! jennifer jason leigh is nicely sweet and innocent as a junior high girl struggling with sexuality . phoebe cates as the girl who believes herself to be in the only truly " mature " relationship anyone has ( with a college boy ) is fresh and believable . judge reinhold as leigh 's older brother is inspired . mike damone is a sleaze and a great character ( if only he really believed in himself as much as he wants others to ) . in fact , this film boasts huge numbers of young actors who went on to become stars . the script by a very young cameron crowe is brilliant ! fast times came out at roughly the same time as the last american virgin and several years after rock and roll high school . neither of those other films is anywhere on par with fast times . at times , light and airy , fast times carries a serious " message " that teen agers are truly finding their way in life in the best way they know how . it is somewhat inspired that we never actually see the parents of any of the kids in the film . the adults we see are those with whom they interact with outside the home : truly , teenagers feel that their young lives are more affected by people other than their parents . while last american virgin approached some of the same topics that fast times does , it did it in a more sinister way . fast times does n't gloss over teen age problems , but puts them in perspective of how the teenager his / herself deals with them . yes , it 's a comedy and yes it is funny , but it is not just a film for kids

books neg 191.txt i read this book with an open mind . i am familiar with the tremendous criticism that has arisen from claims that survivors of child abuse may use their backgrounds to claim some sort of privileged status . in a few cases , i think this criticism may be legitimate ; in other cases , not . so i was interested to see if there were perhaps legitimate reasons to criticize survivors of the holocaust or their advocates in the jewish community . ( note : i am not equating child abuse and the holocaust . i am saying that when people speak up about terrible things , there is often a tendency to see them as whiners who are shirking their responsibilities . all things do not have to be equally terrible to promote this societal reaction . ) i did n't find anything in this book to convince me of that . what i found was to me an unconvincing and highly subjective summary of the jewish reaction to the holocaust , in which the author claims that it did not become a big deal until a long time after it was over , and that it was made into a big deal for illegitimate reasons , but this discussion is so subjective and brief that i was not persuaded to adopt his point of view . the bulk of the book consists of complaints that jewish organizations unfairly extorted money from countries such as switzerland . the argument becomes fairly technical here and evaluating it is beyond me because i have never read the reports ( " audits , " etc. ) to which the author refers . but i think that focusing so narrowly on money misses the point . i expected to see a general discussion of the ways in which the author alleges that an emphasis on the holocaust caused some jews to " play the victim card , " and what i got was a very indepth discussion of several fights about money about which i have no way of determining the truth of the author 's allegations . to me it seems obvious that the holocaust was a terrible atrocity with devastating consequences for the jews , and many lives were destroyed or damaged as a result . it seems reasonable to me that the jewish community would insist that society recognize the destruction and damage , and to the extent that this book detracts from this , i think it is unfortunate
software pos 936.txt the rosetta stone language software was a great investment . the product provides learning words together with listening , seeing , and hearing or the user can select one of these individually or even practice writing words and phrases . it provides an easy to use interface and you can learn at your own pace . the product has been worth it 's hefty price . i do recommend purchasing a german / english dictionary to accompany the software . i have also had in the past a basic german 101 course prior to using rosetta stone , so it may be difficult to start for a person with no knowledge of the german language , such as pronunciation of basic words or greetings
books pos 866.txt set in a german village reminiscent of grimm 's fairy tale world this book will quickly have readers under it 's spell . this tale within a tale within a tale concerns a young clockmaker , karl , who needs to create a figure for the great clock of glockenheim to mark the end of his apprenticeship . time is running out for karl and he is fretful because has not yet made the figure . at this same time fritz , a young storyteller is telling his latest spooky tale to the villagers . fritz launches in to a very mysterious tale of a prince , who it is disovered at his " death " is actually kept alive by clockworks rather than by a heart . also in fritz 's story is a stange man named dr. kalmanius . when this highly unusual man is described by the storyteller an identical man suddenly appears . the stunned audience quickly leaves . as the others leave this strange man approaches karl and presents him with the needed clock figure " springing " fritz 's tale alarmingly to life . as always philip pullman creates a vibrant and engaging cast of characters who will leave an imprint on the reader 's memory . the illustrations by leonid gore capture both the fairy tale spirit and the horror under the surface . this is a quick but original and engaging read that will appeal to both horror and fairy tale fans . do n't miss it
camera pos 673.txt this is a must have item for your kodak dig . camera . it allows for filters , tele / wide aux lenses or any 55mm screw on attachment . apart from that the black metal enclosure compleatly covers the entire lens assemby , at any zoom or focal length . this adds a very strong and valuable protection to your lens . if you accidentally bang the camera against a hard surface this adapter may very likely save your lens ( camera ) from destruction . i always keep it on with a skylight filter , the skylight or a uv filter further protects the lens from impact , scratches and dust . if used when the lens is not fully extended ex : wide angle to normal zoom , the adpter also helps block out stray light and acts as a light shade . kodak aught to have this built into their camera as a permanent fixture , but alas they make extra revenue on their accessories . do buy it !

camera neg 808.txt i recently bought a new celestron nexstar 4se telescope and this eyepiece accessory kit . much to my disappointment , the eyepieces in this kit did not fit very well into the eyepiece holder of the telescope , and when cold ( nights in colorado are 25-45f ) , the eyepieces did not fit at all . celestron customer service was horrible and did not pay attention to my problem and did not follow up by email as promised . when i called a second time , they had no clue about the construction of the eyepieces and no thoughts about how to fix this problem . amazon replaced the kit ( thank you amazon ! ) , but the replacements did not fit either . i 'm returning that kit too . i finally bought a kit from meade ( 3 eyepieces and a moon filter ) that fit properly and are very easy to use . to be fair , if these eyepieces fit your telescope then they are a tremendous value ( hence the rating of 2 stars rather than 1 ) . the meade kit is a worse value , but because they work in my nice new scope , they are the best for anyone using a nexstar 4se
books neg 248.txt god forbid i be so bold as to trash a classic . and yes , maybe because of all the raving reviews from my friends and from the book 's great reputation , i entered it with high expectations . - which the book however did not satisfy . yes , it is a good comedic parody of the upper class of the time , a lampoon of the courtship ritual , and of course oh so witty , blah blah blah , but it just was n't my cup of tea . the main character was likeable , but that aside , i found it completely insufferable to read through , and absolutely painfully boring . every subsequent event from the very beginning could be predicted , let alone the ending . not that anything really ever happens - the entire book could be summed up with , " then they walked and talked and had tea and walked and talked and had tea , walked and talked and had more tea , then got married and lived happily ever after . " the entire novel was a headache of girly gossip and mental drama . it would save more time just to watch a chick flick . so if you 're interested in the relationship fiascos of fictious characters , witnessing the agony over who 's going to marry who ( even though the reader could already predict the happily-ever-after match-making light-years in advance ) , then this is the book for you ! ! if not , then i suggest picking up some dan brown .
books neg 342.txt i 'd never read berry before , but as far as i can tell , this brief collection of six essays and lectures sticks to familiar territory . however , it 's probably not the best entry point for people who are newcomers to his realm . there are two related problems with the book : one of presentation , and one of tone . the problem with presentation is that the pieces are so short that there 's no room for specifics . so , while one might be more or less in accord with the broad strokes of berry 's vision , there 's no detail to back it all up . the problem with tone is that from the very first page the reader feels like they are being lectured at . of course , some of the pieces are lectures , but there 's a certain condescension that runs throughout the book . it comes out when berry uses certain words such as the three as of " appropriate " , " authentic " and " adequate " . when these are used ( as they often are ) , there he 's obviously made some kind of value judgment , but the reader is never let in on it . the end result of the two flaws is that the reader feels like a hectoring argument is being made without any supporting logic - - which ultimately smacks of preaching to the choir . which is unfortunate , since i tend to agree with berry on a lot of things ( though not his anti-abortion stance ) . small farms are good , agribusiness is bad , stewardship of the land is good , extraction industries are bad , treating the body as an organic whole is good , and things of that nature . alas , he has a tendency of making sweeping assertions and accusations that are far too simplistic and shrill to be useful . two examples from the first 15 pages will suffice to illustrate : " this is a world in which the cultures that preserve nature and rural life will simply be disallowed . " and " communists and capitalists are alike in their contempt for country people , country life , and country places . " berry also succumbs to the trick of creating straw men to counter his theses . for example , in one essay , he claims that conservationists are people who want to simply preserve land in a pristine , untouched state , and that 's all . while there are certainly some conservationists who feel that way , they are a small minority of a a much larger community who actually is in almost total accord with berry 's views on stewardship and land use . it certainly does n't help matters that his view of small-scale farming appears to be heavily tinted with rose-colored glasses . his claims that modern agribusinesses has rendered the small farm economically unviable sounds like a reasonable proposition . however , it ignores the fact that , historically , small scale farming ran on the thinnest of margins , was subject to all kind of external instability ( weather , vermin , etc. ) , and operated on only slightly better than a subsistence level . in farming , cash is scarce , that 's why people abandoned it in droves whenever the opportunity presented itself , such as in wwii , when all those defense-industry factories were opened in california . ( of course , in berry 's vision , you do n't really need cash , because you barter for everything you need from your neighbors . ) berry 's exhortations to create small-scale communities is worthy stuff , and even in cities people are creating this . the growth of csas , farmers markets , and the like in the past decade is a tangible indicator of this . however , to achieve the large scale results berry seeks requires a more rigorous roadmap than what is provided in this slim collection
software pos 63.txt i ordered the box version from amazon , instead of the download from the manufacturer not only because it was less expensive , but the main reason was so that i would have a paper manual . so many programs do n't come with hard copy manuals and i prefer them over on-line help . as for the program itself , i trialed a download first . for me , the thing i fell in love with was the ability to call up multiple images , side by side , and compare them ! it makes selecting the best image a breeze - a huge timesaver . you also have the ability to swiftly zoom in to check focus at full rez . another wonderful thing is that putting the curser over one of the preview images , and sliding it , will slide all the open previews simultaneously , so you do n't have to individually zoom and move each image . you can do this with up to 6 images at a time ! you can also do a quick histogram check by hitting the " h " key , which makes it easy to toss off bad exposures at the same time as the review . while you 've got the previews open you can hover the mouse over them and hit any # key to color-code the image . the colors can be keyed to whatever description you want . i do " 1=green " for yes , " 2=yellow " for maybe , and " 3=red " for no . there 's room for quite a few more colors after that . i then hit the sort key back in the main screen and quickly select all the red " no " images and delete them . after i have all my green " yes " images , i then review them 6 at a time to give them star ratings . i resort by rating and now all the best images are at the top of the page and i can start processing them . you can batch process file name , and some other things that i do n't bother with , as well . it 's got some nice keywording ability and you can easily sync the keywords with your photoshop files . what 's incredibly nice is that you can click on any word in the keyword list and all the images you own , with those keywords , are immediately shown in thumbnails ! finding an image is actually fun ! it will even give you thumbnails of images you do n't even store on your hard drive anymore ! fantastic program - i highly recommend it ! the only reason i did n't 5 star it is b / c it 's not all that intuitive . this is a read-the-manual kind of program , but you can do an awful lot with it without having to get too far in the book . ; )
software pos 146.txt i was really surprised to read some of the other reviews about this product - - it 's as we we 've purchased entirely different programs . in my experience with this software , i 've found it to be extremely smooth-running and user-friendly from installation to printing , and the card selection and customization is second to none . there have been perfect cards for every occasion to date and we 've customized them countless ways - - adding and editing photos , moving text , sending ecards , you name it ! navigating within the art studio is very intuitive . printing cards from the sofware is very easy and the on-screen configuration works great . unlike some of the other reviews , i have n't had the problem of having to re-configure every time i print . we set it up once and that was it . i 've printed on card stock paper , which turns out gorgeous , and we 've also printed the quarter-fold plain letter size which also looks great and works perfect with size a2 envelopes ( this is a great printing option if you do n't want to buy card stock paper ! ) . i 've used this software on all of my computers , have recommended it to many people , and so far have not yet encountered or heard of any problems . i highly recommend it . it 's a fun program , the recipients will love their customized cards , and it will save you money in the long run

health neg 594.txt both my wife and i have high blood pressure , which our doctor would like us to track at home . after checking out many brands and styles of automatic monitors , and based on the reviews here , i did n't hesitate to buy the mark of fitness , inc monitor ( prevention edition ) . when i received it , there were two problems : first , there was no owner 's manual inside . since i kept getting an " err 2 " message , i had no way of checking what that meant . ( amazon.com suggested i look online for a pdf version somewhere . unfortunately , the mark of fitness ' web site did n't have online manuals . ) the second and more important problem with this product was that it was clearly very inaccurate . when i finally was able to get some readings , they were : 112 / 64 , 106 / 60 , 96 / 61 , 106 / 62 , 109 / 64 , and 115 / 62. oh , how i wish some of those were my readings ! maybe it was just my misfortune to get that one in 500 lemons with no owner 's manual and who knows what else wrong with it , but unfortunately , i wo n't take a chance on trying another one . it 's going back today

software neg 217.txt i bought this upgrade because i thought it would let me share my contacts . it says so on the box , but it doesn't . it works just like the old contacts which you ca n't share with others except if you export it . no live sharing . why could n't they make it so i could put the file on my server ? or on a secure site ? then all my office can work off one contact list . 50% or more of the time the business contacts ca n't be found when you search for a contact . it 's like the business contacts is an add in that does n't work with outlook . or you add contacts , save it , email to the saved email address and then go to find the contact later and it is gone . also , lots of times when you try to send , the email wo n't send , it stays in the outbox . and repeatedly you open and hit the send button but it wo n't change to send status . now , if you leave it in the outbox , sometimes that fools the program into letting you send other email . or sometimes you can forward and send. . geez , what a waste of money this upgrade was . we wo n't be using it on any of our other computers and we have n't bought if on the new computers we have ordered .
dvd neg 292.txt my impression watching this turkey was that it had to be the work of a film student desperately trying to impress some artsy instructor . it 's all style , no substance . i got the vague impression that there was a story somewhere in this mess of flashbacks , long slow camara pans across stephen dorff 's very trendy and stylish haircut , and yelling matches with side characters whose only function seems to be to have someone to yell with . despite the very art-house feel of it , the story is lost , the viewer is never quite sure if the " philosophy " of the main character is meant to be taken seriously , and the style is nothing we have n't seen done better other places . all in all , i found it pretty vapid , painfully slow , and incredibly frustrating , because there is a good movie in here somewhere , if only the script had gone to someone else to make . on a side note , toby maguire shows up for a little while as a stoned out of his mind loser , which was a bit of a trip given where his career eventually went

dvd neg 649.txt after reading a couple of other reviews about the & quot ; quality&quot ; of transfer on this dvd , i decided i wanted this in my collection . what i thought would be good or atleast a decent enough picture quiality , i was very dissapointed.the quality of transfer of the picture is horrible ! ! ! a great movie a total real diaster flick in picture quality . non anamorphic , deffintaly not remastered or digitally transfered . picture tones are very , very bad , along with what little color that is desplayed . almost a black & amp ; white picture with most of the entire movie too dark to make out what is going on . even with my brightness turn all the way up on my tv , it still was so dark it almost was n't worth continue watching.the only things positive on this dvd was the fact it was in widescreen and & quot ; suppossedly&quot ; in dolby digital ex . the beginning dolby intoduction was deffinatly in dolby and had good sound but the movie itself did n't distributeand dolby sounds that i could make out on my theatre sound system . sounded like mono to me.thsi dvd reproduction stinks and i suggest those that are into quality dvd and getting you money worth saty away from this & quot ; goodtimes video&quot ; version untill it is put on dvd correctly . why they botherd is beyond me . because i wanted to have a copy of this movie in widescreen , i am taping it on to vhs for my collection and going to try and return it for something better tommorrow . i suppsoe i 'll have to be content that i got the widscreen version on vhs for now untill they re-release it on dvd with better quality , or they show it on tv in widescreen which i highly doubt . heck , even taping it off tv you 'd get a better picture quality than this dvd

music pos 669.txt basie 's best players come to duke 's place , the columbia records 30th street studios in 1961 and face ellington 's finest . not a battle , but not quite a merger , either , since the count 's contingent is heard in one speaker and their hosts in another channel . there 's more than an hour of good music on here , laid down in the dying days of big jazz touring orchestras . popular tastes had changed and the costs of keeping large groups of players together were impossible . this is one of those rare cd 's in which the booklet is almost as good as the music . this one reveals that during this 12-hour late-afternoon-to-early-morning session , one of ellington 's long-time employees quit the group forever because the boss would not take his side in a fight with a colleague . also interesting is the dispute over the title and cover graphics . basie hated columbia 's first idea to bill the date as a competition , and his agent even destroyed the only copy of the original cover art . the end result is an album whose sales over 40 years have been hurt because no one knows its name . the cover finally chosen says " the count meets the duke " but in larger letters it declares " first time ! " and then adds " 2 great orchestras " and finally states " duke ellington and count basie . " the label columbia / sony put on the disc itself for this reissue says " duke ellington meets count basie " which makes no sense because they had known each other since the 20's . if you already like both orchestras , you 'll want to own this late career session . if you want an introduction to each group in its waning years , the cd serves nicely for that , too . this disc really jives , so do n't be expecting any ballads here

music pos 622.txt the animals , a group that included eric burdon and alan price , were the first major pop stars to emerge from newcastle , a city located about 300 miles north of london , therefore far removed from where most talent scouts were searching . it is fortunate for us all that the animals were discovered because they recorded some of the best r+b music to come of the uk in the sixties . their biggest hit was house of the rising sun , a re-working of a folk song ( apparently inspired by josh white 's version of the song ) that gave them a transatlantic number one hit . they had five other top ten uk hits with mickie most , these being i 'm crying , do n't let me be misunderstood ( a cover of a nina simone song ) , bring it on home to me ( a sam cooke cover ) , we gotta get out of this place ( the version included here is the uk version - a markedly different recording was released in america but was unavailable for inclusion in this set ) and it 's my life . apart from their singles , the animals recorded many other covers including boom boom , dimples , i 'm mad again ( all john lee hooker ) , around and around , memphis tennessee , how you 've changed ( all chuck berry ) , i 'm in love again , i 've been around ( both fats domino ) , talking about you , hallelujah i love her so and i believe to my soul ( all ray charles ) . these covers clearly demonstrate what their main influences were , but they also wrote some of their own songs . all the music i 've mentioned so far and much more can be found on this excellent compilation . nevertheless , despite the title of the compilation , it is n't actually their complete recordings - there is a sub-text explaining that these are the complete recordings that they made with mickie most as producer , although the liner notes describe their whole career . after the split , they switched to another record label , where they had some success using the name eric burdon and the animals , including two more uk top ten hits ( do n't bring me down , san franciscan nights ) and several lesser hits , all of which can be found elsewhere ( search for eric burdon ) . alan price left the group before the split with mickie most and had several hits as a solo singer . these are also outside the scope of this collection but are easy to find . this complete collection ( apart from the american version of we 've got to get out of this place ) of the first and most important part of the animals ' career may be more than some people want - there are single cd collections available if you just want the hits - but if , like me , you like to explore beyond the hits , this is for you

health pos 13.txt very happy with this purchase . received it in a reasonable time and at a great price including the rebate for signing up for an [...] credit card . it is easy to use and seems more accurate than the wrist type monitors . i like the history feature in order to determine the average blood pressure over a long period of time since pressures change daily ! good machine especially since it has an ac adapter so that there is no need to change batteries frequently ! also , the intellisense feature makes sure the cuff is always properly inflated before readings

camera pos 111.txt when i bought this camera the sales people tried to get me to buy another battery . they said the one that came with it would only be good for about 20 minutes . now i have bought alot of items in my lifetime , a 20 min battery on a camera just doesnt seem like a very good " business " choice . so i said no . so i got the camera , charged the battery until the light went green ( which sucked because i wanted to play with it right when i got it ) and started taking pictures ( oh i also got a 2g cf ) worked great....so i planned to go up a mountain and take soem scenery shots . keeping in mind what the sales person had told me i pocketed the charger just incase . well , 6000 ' , 300 pictures , and 5 hours later the camera is still running strong , still have 200 shots left for the trip home , battery life indicator hasnt budged off of the full button . so all in all , i think the battery life is great , now i can see if your taking say thousands of pictures all in a row you may need another but for just going on a trip and shooting a few pictures at every stop point , the original will work fine . as for the quality of photos.....i love them

camera neg 959.txt i spend hours pouring over reviews trying to decide which ultracompact was the best deal and the best overall camera . in the end , it came down to panasonic 's fx01 and cannon 's sd600. i read the warnings from other reviewers that the panasonic 's images were n't top quality , but i chose to ignore those reviewers because on paper the fx01 looks like it would out perform the sd600. i was wrong . after using the fx01 for a few days i knew what those other reviewers were talking about - grainy photo after grainy photo . i really really wanted this camera to be great , but it just wasn't . actually , my old 3mp camera took better shots then the 6mp fx01 ! very disappointing . i ended up returning this camera to amazon ( very easy-great service ) because of the poor image quality . i mean , wanting good photographs is why you take photos , right ? i know someone with the sd600 and he 's very happy with the quality . judging by the customer images on the sd600 's page on amazon , i think i should 've gone with cannon

camera pos 831.txt this is only the second pair of binoculars i 've owned but i 've used many pairs before from low end to relatively high end ones like nikons and leicas . i can say without hesitation that the canon 18x50s have met all my expectations for clarity , build quality , and ease of use . they are still quite heavy so , you wo n't be holding them too long in one position but , the stabilization feature provides a stable , gitter free image . in my opinion , this feature makes up for optics that may not be in the same league with the high end stuff : the canon 18x50s have more usable magnification for the money for non-tripod , hand held applications . while this is not a scientific comparison , this is an example of the useability and magnification : i was at the beach looking at a parasailer in the distance - with the naked eye ( 20 / 20 for the record ) , i could see the chute pattern and a black speck below it ; with my old minolta 10x50s ( jittering in my hands ) i could make out shapes of heads and legs ; with the canon 18x50s , i could clearly see two people , a man and a child as well as the chute 's cords - pretty impressive . my only two gripes that have also been mentioned before are : no lense caps and the eye cups are stiff , fit poorly ( to my face any way ) and are uncomfortable . i find it better to fold the cups back for " eye glass " use even though i do n't wear glasses . other than that , i am very pleased with this purchase and would also highly recommend purchasing from adorama camera - they are quick , accommodating and responsive .

camera neg 958.txt the panasonic is very compact , very stylish sexy as my wife called it , but the photos are very disappointing : they are way to noisy ! even if set on the lowest asa setting at 80asa it is just barely acceptable and they do get progressively worse anything above 100asa . the colours are good , and it does take very good videos , but still photos are just plain bad when compared to other cameras in photoshop cs2. of course it is easy to understand why : the native resolution of the images . if one investigates such things , will notice that the panasonic is only 72 dpi , same as sony 's , canon improves this to 180 , and nikon is at 300 dpi . it is not just about megapixels folks , but how those megapixels are recorded and at what resolution . obviously a camera with 72 dpi will have more noise than one at 180 or 300 dpi . so before you buy any digital camera or thinking about upgrading to a newer model , do yourself a favour . try 4 or 5 cameras in the same megapixel range at a good camera store by taking photos of the same subject in the same light condition . set the camera for the lowest asa and the highest picture quality in jpg format , take the photos , pop the sd card into the computer , compare the images in photoshop . enlarge to full pixel size ( 100% ) , and and look at the meta data at the same time and you will see for yourself . that is what i did , since i was not very happy with the images my panasonic produced ! i had this camera for 11 months and 20 days exactly , and today i traded it in on a nikon p5000 after evaluating over a dozen models including the leica d-lux3 10mp camera , and driving the sales persons crazy with all the testing and spending 4 hours at the store , but it was very educational for them too
camera pos 928.txt i 'd love to read a review from anyone who has purchased this camera , the aiptek zoom dv-6 mp image stabilizing camcorder w / 3x optical zoom . i see the claim that it has 3x optical zoom and cannot help but question this because i am unable to find this product on aiptek-dot-com and this cam has supposedly been available since july 30th , 2006. am wondering what gives with that ? please someone , post a review of this model and hopefully , some picture results too . let us know about this 3x optical zoom , please ! i had to pick a rating , so the four star rating was based on the mpvr version of this camera - - which i own and find to be a very decent gadget . mine is over a year old and still going strong - no problems with that model . mp3 's sound terrific . i convert movies for viewing on the camera while on the go and.. . " wow " for its quality . i have recorded sounds and more . very decent ! just drag and drop my files from my pc to the sd card and i can switch out movies and mp3's . i am happy with that model , but it does not have any optical zoom - just digital . still get pretty good pix tho , just use the various settings.. . my little homemade movies are good , very decent , but without additional lighting , indoor movies will be dark . this camera doesnt handle well in strong sun - i use an umbrella over my cam as i film . big diff . so , is this newer model really all that much better ? ca n't wait to know ! 3x optical sounds good. .
camera pos 386.txt i received the xacti a few weeks ago and it 's performing like i hoped it would . the controls are a very simple and intuitive . all the required hardware is included . does not require any additional software to run on mac or windows . i have a macbook with boot camp running windows xp pro . the camera works easily with either platform . it is recognized as another drive and does not require any additional software to download the images and movies onto the hardrive . i am using a sandisk 2gb sd memory card . another big plus is not having to wait while downloading real-time like you would have to with minidv . the quality may not be the same as minidv but the convenience and ease of use make up for the difference . the quality is much better than a digital camera when taking movies and people will think it 's just a camera by it 's small size . my old camera was a 2 mega pixel canon powershot a60. this is rated at 6 mega pixel . you can definitely see the difference in the pictures and movies . when filming movies , the higher frames per second sample rate makes the images smooth , even when taking pictures of high speed objects like helicopter rotor blades and airplane propellers . this is my first camcorder so i ca n't really compare to anything else ( except my old camera ) but the ease of use will make you want to use it all the time and people will start to tell you to put that thing away
books neg 495.txt i am vietnamese and i grew up in new orleans during the 80 's and 90 's when the first waves were settling down there . i hate to tell this to everyone on this site but this book is the worst piece of fiction ever written . like many books written by someone who does not belong to the culture that he writes about , the book takes great liberties with the imagination and presents the stories from the viewpoint of the writer and not the actual people . the vietnamese characters in the book are portrayed as backwards , uneducated , and simple . further , the stories are depressing and very few of the characters seem to have any success . if you actually grew up in new orleans during the time that the vietnamese americans were setting root during the 80 's and 90 's , you would know that by and large , the community pulled itself from nothing to become quite successful . no real vietnamese american thinks or acts like the characters portrayed in this book . i repeat - no vietnamese american thinks or acts like the characters portrayed in this book . the book repeats many of the fallacies that i have noticed in other books written by predominantly caucasian male authors about east asian culture . there always seems to be 1 ) an asian prostitute 2 ) caucasian guy with asian bride 3 ) asian male in an emasculated role 4 ) asian people as backwards and simple . quite sad . this book reminds me quite a bit of memoirs of a geisha , though that portrayed japanese culture in a better light . by the way , the lady on which " memoirs of a geisha " is based and written about was quite upset at the author of memoirs of a geisha and did not feel that it portrayed her life or her thoughts in any way at all . regardless , if you really want to find out about the vietnamese american experience you should really read a book written by a vietnamese american

books neg 254.txt being an engineer in the aerospace industry i was highly interested in this book based on my experiences from the vantage point a " hard industry . " i personally believe that it 's in our long term interests to maintain a strong manufacturing base because that 's the foundation of real wealth , not legal services or newswires . so this book sounded like the perfect source of information to explain our current economic situation , give an assessment of how bad or how good it really is , and suggest ways to improve it . oh , how very , very wrong i was . . . this book started off strong , . . . for about four pages . after that a litany of tortured logic , un-sourced assertions , facts taken completely out of context except for the author 's subjectively added adjectives , orwellian double-speak , sleight of hand arguments , flat out ridiculuos statements , contradictory assessments , and even emotional vitriol coalesced not so much into an argument for industry but one for eighteenth century mercantilism with perhaps a sprinkling of far left george soros on top to serve as an update for the twenty first century . even a broken watch is correct twice a day though , so there were some good points in the book which buy it the 2 star rating . these include : - manufacturing provides a large source of proprietary knowledge which both improves productivity and serves as a barrier of entry , creating an industry with a large base of high paying jobs , provided it 's run right . ( a big if . ) - high wage nations can still compete effectively with low wage nations in manufacturing by being capital intensive . - americans need to save more and our education system needs to produce more engineers and technically oriented graduates . - there is some excess in the financial services and managers of publicly traded companies take too short term a view , leading them to sell the company upriver in the long run because of a personal temporary short term gain . ( i.e. enron ) a scholarly , fair , and comprehensive book that focused on the above would be extremely interesting and useful . this is not what you 'll get in this book though . instead you 'll get : a begining section about postindustrialism , things like the internet , information technology , financial services , etc. , the things that make the services based economy . in three chapters the author simply sets up straw men by taking the worst examples of post industrial advocates , instead of presenting a comprehensive picture of the post industrial argument . not being satisfied with this he proceeds to beat the straw men , set them on fire , and piss on the smoldering remains . this is where vitriol even comes out , where he equates the post-industrialists to people incapable of even thinking . if someone has to go to this extreme to make their argument , they probably do n't have one . most telling he leaves the final assessment of the value of the internet to a feminist . to me , this would be like leaving the final assessment of how good a bicycle is to , oh , i do n't know , let 's say a fish . a middle section extolls the virtues of manufacturing . this is a bunch of hand picked anectdotal stories and there 's no overview of manufacturing in the world or its real impact on economies at large . this is the kind of subject that screams for reams of data , charts of gdp growth over time , pie charts of the breakdown of economies into services , manufacture , agriculture , etc. you will get none of that . there 's little value except in reassuring the obvious , high wage nations can do manufacturing . many of these cherry-picked anectdotal examples still do n't quite dove-tail with all his claims about manufacturing though ! you also know you 're being left in the dark with a plethora of cya disclaimer statments like " while industry_x has certainly had its share of problems recently . . . " at the begining of a section . a final section basically amounts to an attack on laissez-faire , free markets , and the concept of free trade . george soros and a bunch of other lefties , with pat buchanan thrown in for " balance " , should be listened to instead . the worst part of this book is the author 's lack of an ability to make any sort of coherent argument . examples of twisted thinking abound : - a post-industrial " industry " grows five times over in a certain period . the author then goes onto explain how this is not really real growth but something that in reality is bad . later he proves how great a manufacturing industry is because in the same period it grows a whopping 60% ! self contradictory evaluations of the performance of services vs manufacturing is common and always falls down on the side that the manufacturing industry is far far better than the service industry even when all the standard economic indicators suggest otherwise . the author 's challenge to the reader seems to be " who are you going to believe ? me , or your lying eyes ? " - he rips into american post industrial industries as being labor intensive and vulnerable to low wage nations because americans are no smarter or more creative or more anything than laborers around the world . later he talks about how great german manufacturing is because germans are so much more diligent than the rest of the world 's workers . - the only facts he presents - and they are surprisingly thin and overwhelmed by mere assertions - are always modified by his subjective opinion and never put in context . when describing service industries " paltry " $50 million revenues , " only " 60 , 000 jobs , " disappointing " 24% of revenues from foreign sources is common . but when describing manufacturing " a very high " $6 million revenues , " a good mix " of 1 , 500 jobs , and similar glowing assessments are inevitable despite the number to follow . a number in and of itself means nothing . the fact the author leaves out any head on , direct comparison between industries is telling . - official figures are the ultimate source of information when they agree with what the author believes . when the official figures do n't agree with him , he finds some loner who does and then barely explains how this time around the official figures are somehow wrong . when attacking his straw men though , he accuses them of ignoring official figures and quoting some loner . - gems of orwellian double-speak sentences include examples like " solar is already a fully competitive source of energy in remote areas that do not have grid electricity . ( pg . 184 ) " i.e. it 's competitive where there is no competition ! and " even in singapore , one of the freest societies in the east , the savings rate was successfully boosted by a system of forced savings . . . ( pg . 229 ) " that 's not very free if it 's forced is it ? ( his defense of solar is one of the most hilariously pathetic eight pages i 've ever read and really is worth the price of the book . he capstones it with the " most encouraging " observation that solar cells have gone from producing one third of the energy used to make them before they wore out - that is consuming more total energy in their manufacture than they eventually make ! - to now producing three times as much energy as required to produce them before they wear out . wow , what an achievement . any actual power source converts many thousands of times the energy used to manufacture it before it 's internal workings wear out , but whatever . . . ) - americans are dumb and the only successful american companies basically blundered into monopolies on standards . the american economy , despite the statistics , is in bad shape . the japanese instead are eight feet tall , can read people 's minds and see through lead . the japanese economy , despite the statistics , is in really great shape . this type of persistently biased characterization makes you question everything he claims , and eliminates any value or truth he might actually have in his arguments . the author basically ca n't get out of his own way . - he always attacks opponents of his viewpoint by claiming that they do n't put numbers into context , are using twisted logic , making mere assertions instead of quoting facts , etc. , apparently oblivious that these are the very same tactics he himself uses ! - he claims boeing is no longer a good company because 30% of components in a boeing aircraft are now made abroad vs. 2% in the 1960's . this is actually because foreign manufacturing for those components happens to be better and cheaper . america is n't doing that badly in aerospace by the way . the author fails to mention that 50% of the " european " airbus is made in america . this is an example of free trade actually distributing production to where it is most efficient . the list goes on and on to ridiculous proportions . you 'd have to buy the book to see them all because there 's at least one thing an alert and critical reader can find highly questionable on each page . all in all , this book was way off the mark and a highly squandered opportunity . it 's really a mercantilist argument , and the only common thread that i could see in all the author 's cloudy reasoning is that nation 's should do everything in their power to export more than they import no matter what . it 's not , unfortunately , a book about how to revitalize american manufacturing in a globalized world .
books neg 127.txt obviously , from all the reviews , this book appeals to many people . i am not one of them . perhaps it 's because i do n't care for science fiction . i found the writing stilted , the footnotes distracting to the point i stopped bothering with them , the story boring , and the ending ( covered in the introduction ) to be a twilight zone cliche . if , like me , you want to read the book because it has some connection to bicycles and cycling you will be disapppointed .

dvd neg 213.txt bulworth is ostensibly warren beatty 's brave political satire in which a conservative senator suddenly starts liberally voicing those opinions that the rest of us are supposed to be thinking but are afraid to say . he tells a black church congregation to , " put away the malt liquor and fried chicken and stop supporting running backs that stab their wives . " if that 's what you were thinking , you 'll love this movie . otherwise , bulworth is jaw droppingly bad . to take such a hight position as to attack beatty for suggesting that black characters need a white powerbroking partriarch to come to his senses before their concerns can be publicly considered is to give bulworth way more credit than it deserves . it 's distinguished from movies that are simply " bad " through its inclusion on the short list of truly dangerous ones . not content to be racism hiding in plain site , bulworth 's racism is disguised as its own solution . drug dealers have their transactions justified as the only commercial avenue open to otherwise well-intended african-american youths . nina ( halle berry ) articulates an informed point , and it 's a joke because attractive young black women look funny when they talk smart , like high-grammar versions of zip coon . in so doing , beatty reminds black americans that no matter what they accomplish , we know who they really are . however limited the potential of the opening premise ( bulworth plans his own assassination for insurance purposes before inevitably changing his mind ) , the film never approaches the kind of farley brotheresque world that would have been its natural destination . the sincerity of the politician 's catharsis is hidden from us , both because his new outlook is originally motivated only by the insurance scam and because once beatty starts rapping his lines , he never stops , making the actor ( as opposed to the character ) look uncomfortable for the duration . that this movie lured audiences and critics into its didactic spell is astonishing . the film 's ambition to be more than a cute little movie while being exactly the opposite reminds this reviewer of roberto benigni 's embarrassing " life is beautiful " from the year before . both have to be seen to be believed
books pos 321.txt thankfully , this is not littered with platitudes and meaningless anaologies , the hallmarks of 99% of the latest-and-greatest business books . especially since it was written in 1999 , moore 's is an incredibly insightful and prophetic book on strategy for the high-tech industry . he was predicting cutting edge changes then that are coming into reality today in 2005. the book is much more descriptive than prescriptive though , and is best used as a tool to instigate discussions about corporate strategy , rather than as a checklist for strategic implementation . i help run an online software development company and although it is n't exactly " high tech " i still found the vast majority of it very helpful and the rest of it fascinating . market shifts are demanding broadband wireless internet everywhere- -free . companies are shifting towards web-basing software applications . all very relevant to my business . the book is well written , an easy and moderately fast read , and very accessible by anyone who is technology-savvy enough to at least hold an email address . yes , buy it . buy the paperback and save money . short synopsis : in the infancy of a market , products need to be highly tailored to meet the psychological and technical needs of leading edge techno-geeks ; nothing new here . when a company wants to take that product and make it marketable to the middle majority- -where the biggest money sits- -it requires a commitment to discipline and shift its strategy in order to do so . the emphasis shifts intially to identifying a single niche segment and creating a comprehensive , tailored product , that meets all of their needs- -create the " whole product " by using partners and 3rd party services to patchwork the thing together . then , stop tweaking the product . if that works , pick related niches and go after them the same way , creating the " whole product " for each of them . once people at large are comfortable enough to make the paradigm shift for that market ( this all deals with new , high-tech changes ) and start doing so en masse , the strategy must completely shift again to a ship-first / fix-the-product-later mentality in a mad , market share scramble . at this phase , you are " in the tornado . " lots of examples of successful and abysmal strategies used by high tech companies whose names are familiar to everyone , at each stage mentioned above .

books pos 778.txt " the climb " was written by bourkeev and dewalt as an answer to krakaur 's " into thin air " . while not showcasing the same prose as krakaur 's book , i feel that this is utlamitely better . my reasoning for this opinion is that " the climb " seems like a much more fair and unbiased account . bourkeev does not resort to playing the blame game ; he simply tells the story as he experienced it . krakaur , it seemed to me at least , relied to heavily on assumptions , and we all now what happens when you assume ( hint : you make an _____ out of you and me ) and came off as very arrogant and ( for some reason ) took a feverious dislike to bourkeev and lopsang . thought not as well written as " into thin air " , " the climb " still managed to draw me in fully , although some parts of the book are a little confusing , mainly the interview with bourkeev about his single handed rescue of three striken climbers who otherwise would have surely perieshed . this interview was conducted in english , the only problem with that is that bourkeev 's english is not very strong ! it is passable and most of the time you can understand him but in other parts it is very hard to dechyper . dewalt tries to help by adding " translations " about what bourkeev is saying but i felt the interview should have been caried out in bourkeev 's native tongue of russian and then translated into english . to not have done this is a great injustice to bourkeev . if you want to read a fair and unbiased book about the may 1996 everest tragidy that was written simply to tell the truth and not to play smeer tatics and make money ( as krakaur 's clearly was ) , read this . i really recommend you read both books , though and also check out the imax movie " everest " .

books neg 550.txt i 'm trying to figure out what the appropriate subtitle for this book should be and i ca n't decide among the following : * travels through guilt with the world 's 33rd richest hippie * the mind of an empty suit * a self-important revisionist history * how i learned to hate myself and love the third world * memoirs of a cold war paperpusher confessions of an economic hitman by john perkins is an exclamation point riddled history of a few financial manipulations of the cold war by a man who had no stake in his own ambition . the first thing you notice about this account is that it is written by a man who thinks he was sitting on top of the world , when in fact he was just a cog in the energy industry . if you are credulous enough to believe that the debts and revenues associated with the energy business is indeed the core principle of the global economy , then the moral outrage of this book makes sense . but there 's a whole lot to swallow . on the plus side , it 's a fast and somewhat entertaining read . otherwise it is a exercise in the slow revelations of a kind of self-loathing that takes about 20 years to surface . one of the things that i 've had in mind as i was reading this screed was the sense of geography as destiny . as i look at the 20th century , i think of most of it focused on the economics of . perkins was one of the people who made the truth a narrative of economic exploitation . he falls in love with socialist charismatics in latin america , rues the lives of poor peasants , and bemoans the basic nature of corporate capitalism without ever acknowledging or even understanding the basic nature of socialism . perkins is a perfect example of a cultural relativist . a perceptive reader can see how much he hates his hometown and parents and idolizes romantic ideals associated with revolutionary rhetoric . but you ca n't imagine that he even had the temerity to read marx , weber , engles , friere or anyone . back when i was a bit more blackified , i referred to such people as culture vultures . if it 's indigenous , it 's good . but you 'll never see him once talk about infant mortality statistics , literacy rates , crime rates or even inflation . i discovered a bit too late that this book would teach me nothing about the business of foreign direct investment or the workings of the world bank except that he saw it as evil . technically , you 'll get a great deal more insight reading wikipedia . basically , perkins assumes that his game was the only game on the planet , his company was smack dab in the middle of it and that it was all being subtley directed by the cia and nsa and that this is , was and always will be the american way . you really get a foggy view of the evil empire of america from perkins , who resembles nobody quite so much as a cynical wanker who is too soulless to quit the game . it 's a confession all right . by the time i got 2 / 3rds of the way through , reading the book began to become annoying . the incredible vacuity of this man was staggering . there are no personal relationships in the book worth speaking of . he found loyalty only to his bosses worth mentioning . it is a stunning revelation about his character that he never once had a kind word to say or any personal quality worth mentioning about his staff that stands out in memory . we learn that he took one of his charges ( female ) on a yacht cruise to some isle in the caribbean , but that when he got there , he was so sickened by his guilty conscience that he banged his head against the coconut trees . if you want to understand something about the life of an economist and high finance , the best book i 've read is my life as a quant . if you want to understand something about the life of a reluctant spy , the best book to read is larry kolb 's overworld . if you want to get well-written account of a man who was too spoiled to find himself while being a toady in the economic hardball of the cold war era , then this is your book . but it 's nowhere near as good as , say the quiet american . you can imagine that perkins , who is a great admirer of graham greene , might have had aspirations to be such a character as greene might pen . he is earnest to tell such a story that would portray himself thus , but he is to honest to consider himself heroic , and i suspect that he 'll be working off his guilt for the rest of his life . in that regard , ' confessions of an economic hitman ' is ( now prefaced and extended in the paperback edition ) a blueprint for american liberal guilt . if there was ever someone who truly believed that global warming and a host of other blowbacks are destined to doom america to a well-deserved kharmic smackdown , it is john perkins . he has always been a citizen of the world pretending to be a patriotic american , down to the repetitions of his undying faith in the words of thomas paine . you 'd think , being a pseudo-economist , that he 'd have some room in his heart for alexander hamilton . ahh but that would mean that he 'd have to admire courage . i did n't want to be a harsh judge of perkins . i thought i might learn of an extraordinary life , one of conviction and then epiphany . instead i learned of a small yapping dog who was always on a leash he lacked the spirit to gnaw through . someone who would tell us in the end that we should use less oil and that ' corporatocray ' is evil . this book has been a disappointment in many ways . i may well be very happy to read thomas friedman after this . good parts ? yeah there are a few . he speaks about a few south american presidents who might have been contenders . he gives a few details about saudi aramco . but compared to larry kolb 's fascinating and detailed portraits of daniel ortega and adnan khashoggi , this is romper room . if perkins thought he was an agent.. . do n't make me laugh

dvd neg 879.txt this went up from one * in tribute to the neat hammy acting job from alec guiness as charles ii , but otherwise its just a mess . the film called out for a screenplay by a robert bolt or a john prebble , but instead it was penned by its director kenneth hughes , who also gave us such film masterpieces as " casino royale " and " chitty chitty bang bang " . richard harris is his usually unrestrained self , and thats not a compliment . now , i wont even go into the politics , which attempt to portray oliver cromwell as some sort of liberating hero : as ridiculous a take on the english civil wars as alexandre dumas 's paean to charles ii in " twenty years after " , but nowhere near as entertaining .

books pos 599.txt this is the best invertebrate zoology textbook on the market , perhaps the best ever written . the authors are not content to merely present in fine detail the classification , anatomy , physiology , behavior , and ecology of invertebrates , they present alternative interpretations and controversial opinions where these topics are concerned . in that way , invertebrate zoology comes alive as an active , important , and relevant field of study for understanding the ecology and evolutionary relationships of these organisms in a global setting . i highly recommend this book for a course of study or as a reference for earth science instructors who wish to solidify and deepend their knowledge and understanding of invertebrates
music pos 643.txt i heard this music on the excellent p b s documentary : & quot ; liberty - the american revolution&quot ; and i knew i had to have it ! it is the finest music i have heard , capturing the heart and soul of the american revolution . the documentary & quot ; liberty&quot ; was a masterpiece that was beautiful and moving . so too this music with its most wonderful arrangements and accompaniment . i love it ! i could hardly wait to get it in the mail . it framed the documentary ( which i also bought ) like a great frame compliments a beautiful canvas painting . superlatives fail me . this music must be experienced by first watching the great series on the american revolution and then by listening to it apart . this is some of the most wonderful music i have ever heard . it reminds me of the genius of aaron copland who wrote the applachian spring and rodeo suites
dvd neg 299.txt musicals are historically slight in the plot department , and this movie is no exception . three stars : one fading , one rising and one coasting do not help matters either . rita is the fading star . it was painful for me to watch the once dazzling love goddess reduced to playing the controlling widow . the make up department probably had to work overtime trying to cover the circles under her eyes , and her hair and costumes are just bad . novak is the rising star , although i do n't get the 50 's obsession with bubble headed , busty , bleach blond bimbos . it would help if she could act , but sadly her range is very limited . i truly believe they added the dog to help make her character sympathetic , since she was unable to convey it herself . then there is frank just coasting on his charm and cool . does n't seem plausible that a hep cat like him , who could bag any " doll " , " dame " or " mouse ? " , would fall for either of these gals . anyway , i gave it 2 stars because of snuffy the dog . he stole every scene he was in . although that was n't too difficult to do in such a dog of a movie

camera pos 256.txt i bought this lens a little over a year ago for macro shooting . i quickly found out , however , that to shoot macro-only with this lens is a crime . it is a very versitile lens . its fast f / 2.8 aperture makes for good shooting in low light . i pretty much use this outdoors as the 100mm with the 1.6x crop factor of my rebel xt eliminates most indoor oppurtunities . i frequently use this lens for family portraits , the resultant photo is so crisp and clear and the bokeh really helps add snap to the primary subject . as others have stated , this is a heavy lens . it does n't have image stabilization ( is ) so a tripod or monopod is a great accessory to get the best images . i use a beefy monopod for my best shots , although i have a lot of handheld gems.. . if you are tight for cash , this is n't the " one lens " that does it all . if you are looking for a versitile lens that can do outstanding macros and portraits , this is that lens .

music neg 689.txt tony kushner 's liner notes are a chilling foretaste of his jew-hatred-soaked script for the film " munich . " a paragon of self-regard , he sneers at the historicity and compelling morality of the jewish people 's attachment through the millenia to its eternal homeland . rather , kushner makes a point of elevating the moral stature of the islamofascists who have unhesitatingly and unceasingly for a century prosecuted a campaign of genocidal slaughter against any and all jews who sought to reclaim their stolen patrimony ( through aboveboard land-purchase and settlement , prior to wars of justifiable self-defense ) . like his evil arab idols , kushner cannot abide the concept of a restored jewish commonwealth , secured on a foundation of existential legitimacy , political independence , and territorial sovereignty . zionism , and its morally necessary outcome the state of israel , enabled and is continuing to enable the very effloresence of jewish culture in the us in the post-1948 and certainly post-1967 vineyards where the klezmatics have been frolicking and where kushner has gained his fame and fortune . but kushner hates the very thought of being liberated , and seeks to sow that hatred throughout world jewry . the klezmatics should feel ashamed for linking themselves to this cruel purveyor of assisted suicide .

camera neg 217.txt this camera will probably go down in nikon 's history as one of its most over-priced and disappointing cameras . i bought mine through amazon from calumet in january 2003. from the start , the colors never looked right , especially the ghastly magenta-toned skin tones . i also bought the sb800s ( 3 of them ) , thinking the cls would be a great addition . but the system uses ir and is unreliable in any situation except very tight environments . the camera has a wonderful feel , viewfinder and reasonably good controls . but the results are disappointing . the sensor is undersized for this class of camera and considering what its competition ( canon ) offers . nikon finally realized this and on dec. 13 decided to dump all these cameras by lowering the price $1 , 200. it just so happened mine was in melville , n.y. , with a long list of issues to be repaired while it was still under warranty . these include bad af performance since upgrading to v2 of the firmware , bad color , overexposure , blurry images with the vr lens and inconsistent color balance from frame to frame even when using a preset value . i would strongly suggest that you do n't buy this camera and thereby reward nikon for producing an inferior product originally sold at a ridiculous price for what it offers . indeed , forget nikon and go to canon

software pos 362.txt this is truly the killer application for comic book collectors . you get the comic 's whole run from its auspicious origins in 1961 to its current incarnation at the end of 2004 , in a tiny dvd that you can carry anywhere . the thrill of reading classical issues in all their colored glory is not to be missed , particularly for those not reprinted so far . i especially enjoyed the impossible man and molecule man origin stories . seeing how particular adventures ended is also great fun , since i owned some comics from the generally undistinguished 1980s , but did n't know how things turned out . being able to read the entire john byrne run of the mid-eighties was spectacular . it 's even better than his work at the x-men , and almost as cool as the lee-kirby years . this is so much better than the essentials , since it 's in color and so much cheaper , plus it includes the original ads and letter pages . it also beats the masterworks series not only on account of price , but also because it has the original colors . it 's as good as owning the complete collection , but it will take up less space and hence will generate less nagging from mothers or wives . this is a must have item , with perhaps the best price / quality ratio i have ever seen . can it be improved ? sure . why not take advantage of the possibilities of computers and create an index of all characters that would allow the reader to see all appearances of a character over the years ? why not create an index of writers and artists , so that one may quickly get a view of their work ? cross-referencing is the next step the good people at marvel must be working on . but there 's no reason to wait for that . even as it is , this dvd is not just good enough . it is great , like the fantastic four themselves

music neg 830.txt i was deeply disappointed by the so-called & quot ; return of the funk&quot ; with the headhunters reuniting with their original lineup . as compared to herbie hancock 's original & quot ; headhunters&quot ; release , the return of the headhunters is missing one main ingredient , the grease . this recent release has traded the & quot ; grits and gravy&quot ; created by the sounds of overdriven analog equipment and early model synthesizers , for over-produced smooth jazz-funk , complete with overused n'dea davenport r&amp ; b hooks that left this album flat

health pos 624.txt its a nice little trimmer and not cumbersome at all like the remington trimmers . it has a cheap little organizer but as long as your not rough with it , it shouldnt break . another benefit is that you can rinse all the attachments under hot water in addition to brushing the hair out prior to that to ensure a very clean trimmer . just remember folks this is a trimmer not a wet blade or electric razor..it will leave a very fine layer of stubble which is fine by me . a man can still look neat if he shapes up the facial hair before reducing it to fine stubble . my shaving experience with this thing is pleasant...it does not pull hairs which is very refreshing for a trimmer . the only other device i never had / have that problem with is my braun 360 complete ( parts of the year i shave , other parts of the year i trim ) . its a very nice package and efficient . the only drawback is that it seems fragile...so be careful not to drop any part of this set
music neg 207.txt the music of dowland is wonderful - but sting is n't up to interpreting it . you ca n't even distinguish the words half the time , just a jumble of nice sounds from his pretty tenor - he does n't possess the skills to carry it off . this music has to be interpreted by someone with an ability to express thoughts in heightened language...sting , for all his merits , has n't got that in his repertoire yet . it 's an exercise in pretention , laughable at times . the letter reading is ridiculous . i love both sting 's voice and dowland 's song , but this cd is a failure .
health pos 533.txt this shaver replaced a norelco advantage ( 6 years old ) that was shaving good but would no longer hold a charge for more than a couple of days . i ca n't honestly say if it shaves as close as a blade because i have n't shaved with a blade in many years . i have used foil shavers in the past ( braun and panasonic ) and though they might shave closer than a rotary the cost to replace the foils and the nicks that you get is not worth it . i have been using this shaver for about 3 months . during that time i have charged it only twice including the initial charge and that is using it at least every other day . at first i thought it was underpowered because it is so quiet but soon found out that it shaves much closer than my old advantage which i thought was doing a great job . it shaves quick and close ( personally i think as close as a blade ) . when you are done shaving you just rinse it under the tap and let it dry . it does n't get any easier than that . i have cleaned the heads once as stated in the instructions and that is easy too . the only con is i have dry sensitive skin and have not seen any difference between the 3 comfort settings . use electric shave before shaving and i think that you will agree that it shaves as close as a blade without the irritation . highly recommended and worth the price .
dvd neg 574.txt i bought the dvd for my collection after watching the film on tcm . the musical perfomances are terrific . upon receiving the dvd , i was very disappointed in the quality of the dvd production . the dvd states digital sound , but the sound quality is very poor and not at all as enjoyable as the broadcast on tcm .
health neg 503.txt i purchased the waterpik na-2 gentle sinuse rinse attachment , expecting it to work with the waterpik professional ultra dental water jet , since that is what was advertised . they do n't fit in this model , so do n't waste your time purchasing both together ! the sinus attachments are too short , so they ca n't " click " into the water pik . the end result : water leaks out , and there is no pressure through the sinus attachment . i had to return both items since the amazon rep could n't find any sinus attachment to work in the waterpik ultra model . it 's a shame because i love the small footprint of the waterpik ultra , and it comes with a lot of cool attachments . hopefully waterpik will come up with something in the near future

( so leave it running ) ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! but wow ! ! ! ! ! ! ! i should have done this sooner , or should i have ? as soon as it was running illustrator cs2 auto updated itself . it wanted it 's adobe bridge fixed up . so i let it . this is just exactly what people have been complaining about . ******** the bridge is fixed ********* way super cool dude ! i keep the bridge open on the right monitor and i can drag art into illustrator cs2 at lightning speed . the whole time i get to see super big previews of all the artwork i need to work with . way better than xppro 's little thumbnails . live trace : realy nice , i think this is what these companies are using to sell vectored line art to printers like me . it is very accurate and seems to acomodate all those nasty giant pixels that up till now , took a human brain to see past while vectoring . ok , it 's not as good as a skilled craftsman such as ( full of ) myself , but for only about $160 or so , it 's like a gift from almighty god ! no crashes , no bugs , just pure inteligence from adobe once again . do n't you think of a little white mud hut in the dessert when you say adobe ? i really apreciate the object oriented work bar thing at the top , wait , let me go look at what it 's called , hmmmm , still do n't know , well it changes according to what kind of object you 've clicked on in your artwork . also this new wonder of technology solves an old problem of global color change needed for color separation work . that top task bar object oriented do-hickey is similar but better than the one in photoshop . transparent objects , looks like everything can be transparent , wow , do you know what that means ? ? ? i gotta go use it some more , it 's just way to cool . ok , i 'm back , even fonts can be transparent , .tiffs .jpgs , everything . this means way less jumping back and forth from photoshop to illustrator . but i do believe you have to be very capable with your hardware , operating system , and have at least a year ; full time with illustrator and photoshop to fully appreciate the thought and creative potential that adobe has opened up for us

camera pos 504.txt i recently recieved my new camera , and i am thrilled . i have been researching which camera to buy since december ( when our last camera went capoot ) . there have been mixed reviews for the olympus sw series , but could not resist the appeal of this camera 's unique features . i cannot wait to take it into the pool this summer with the kids . so far , the point and shoot options and pictures have been lovely . any person can screw up pictures with any camera , but this camera has so many features to avoid that . my husband and i had a wonderful time taking extreme close up shots of our garden . i have not seen that quality , and had that much satisfaction from a camera since we first switched over to digital . i am very pleased , to say the least , with this purchase .
dvd pos 996.txt the show is absolutely great ! blue falcon is another space ghost and dynomut is the futuristic version of scooby doo . dim witted and loveable . getting the complete show is great and the shows from these hb vaults are all looking pretty good with bright and vivid colors ( amid some nasty scratches and dust , but it was cheap animation folks ) . as a scooby fan this is a must own ! i quite enjoy the blue falcon / dynomut show also . 5 stars for the show . the set however nice still drops the ball , you get two single sided dvds and two flippers . the problem with this is that the dvds are all on top of each other with maybe a 1 / 16th of an inch between them both . i know this was to cut down on costs but it makes the two flipper discs quite hard to get out without scratching them or marking them up with a good fingerprint smear . but then again if it was a perfect world we could n't complain . all in all a solid set ! 4 1 / 2 out of 5

dvd neg 709.txt i viewed this dvd and would give it a 1 out of 5 stars . this is great if you are in college and researching male dancers or something but otherwise it 's kind of lame . it shows about 5 dancers in one club and they interview various women in the club and get their opinions about strippers . i still have not made the connection as to why ron jeremy has anything to do with this documentary ! ladies , if you are expecting to see skin , this dvd shows very little . others may have a limmited interest if you have followed the male dancer trends in the us .
music pos 174.txt it 's hard to believe this music is more than a quarter century old now . i think it would recieve the same kind of accolades if had come out yesterday . but it didn't . it came out in the summer of 1979. it was the summer before my sophomore year in college , my first summer away from home . for at least a week , anytime it was my turn to put something on the turntable , i 'd select side 1 of " rust never sleeps . " it took me at least that long to flip the darn thing over . and then , when i did , for the next week , anytime it was my turn to put something on the turntable , i 'd select side 2 of " rust never sleeps . " my flatmates never complained . oddly , the songs i see getting the most grief in the reviews here are my faves . you do n't really want to do without the swooping lead guitar , contagious handclaps , and hysterically funny yet politically cutting chorus of " welfare mothers , " now , do you really ? as for " sedan delivery , " i have only the vaguest clue of what it 's about , but it 's sure a scorcher ( and it 's still hard to find a job ) . allright , maybe we do n't need two versions of " hey hey , my my , " but which one would you delete ? as far as i 'm concerned , there 's only one song here that has n't withstood the test of time : " sail away , " which is innocuously pretty , but lacks the bark and bite of even the other acoustic stuff . " trasher " and " pocahontas " are both beautiful and mean in just the right amounts and places . poor marlon , poor csn . do i wax nostalgiac ? perhaps , but not overly so . this remains essential neil , which is to say as essential as rock ' n roll gets . it still sounds fresh and relevant . and fun . did i mention fun ? in fact , i 'm gonna go plunk it on right now , maybe take a breather between " sail away " and " powderfinger " to relive the lp experience . you should too .
health neg 465.txt before you buy , be sure to check where the pen was made . i have a number of older cross pens that say " usa " near the top , and they are great pens . however , i have bought three different ones in the past few years that do not indicate where they were made , and they are of inferior quality . the top and bottom halves are loose , and have to be carefully manipulated to come together without a gap . the first one i got , i sent it back to cross for warranty repair under their " lifetime guarantee , " only to receive it back unchanged telling me that it was just fine - and a " handling fee " attached . i was willing to believe it was simply an anomaly , one bad pen . so later on when some new colors came out , i bought two more - only to see that they have the same quality defect . my advice : if you want a good cross pen , go to the secondhand store and buy one that was made in usa . they are n't making them the same anymore .

camera pos 885.txt we bought this camera because our other digital camera ( sony dsc-h1 ) was too large to carry around a lot of the time . we took it skiing with us ( whistler , bc ) and it took some outstanding pictures , both of persons and of landscape / scenery . it is small enough that you can pretty much carry it anywhere , anytime . others may disagree , but the touchscreen menu controls are easy to use and fairly intuitive . fingerprints do get on the screen but you hardly notice them and they are easily removed ( or better yet , use the little wand they give you with the camera instead of your fingers , that does n't leave any marks on the screen ) . to summarize : this is an excellent camera , very small size but with a large 3 " led display , takes excellent pictures , and the touchscreen menu is easy to use and intuitive . most people will be very happy with this camera if they buy it . the only negative thing is that this camera does not have a view finder , but unless you have very bright sun at your back this is n't too much of a problem .
dvd neg 336.txt denzel washington is probably my favorite actor . even in that dog of a movie called the manchurian candidate , he shone . tom hanks ? well , lemme quit hating the guy . this is a well-intentioned movie , tom did a creditable job , and we had extreme close-ups with funny colors to camouflage the spots where he overreached . i was also pleasantly surprised to see antonio banderas fly in the face of his latino studliness by playing a gay guy . a passionate one , though , since he 's still a latino , after all . actually , this is a hollywood " message movie , " and you know what that means . it 's about as subtle as michael moore . those who agree with the message flock to be beaten about the head by it for two hours . those who the filmmakers would like to see the movie , those who do n't agree with the message , stay as far away from it as possible . there 's a scene in the library where nobody wants to sit at the table with aids boy . the way they stared at him reminded me of " lao wei in china " experiences . denzel 's character was reminded of segregation , even though he 's too young to remember it , and started to care about tom hanks ' character . aids discrimination is bad . actually , any discrimination at all is bad . and that 's the movie 's message . i agree with the message , but still . that 's all we 've got . as a totally irrelevant non-sequiter , if the name " sam francisco " means anything to you , you 've seen subtle commentary on discrimination . i love a great courtroom drama . this one was merely good . with so much of an agenda to squeeze into a two-hour film , they had to take a few shortcuts here . sad , ai n't it ? but even so , a well-intentioned film that i 'm glad i saw . once . not twice . once is enough , thank you .
software neg 216.txt while microsoft tries very hard to make office " think ahead of me , " they almost always seem to get it wrong . the result is a package that consistently annoys me . it is true that one can turn off the " helpful " hints and otherwise customize the programs so that they are less hindering , however the bloated package will nevertheless usurp your computers resources like nobody 's business . in my opinion , office ' 97 was an excellent package , and the versions since then have gone steadily downhill . as with many people , i use office at work because i have no choice . at home i 've had good luck with staroffice from sun . while not perfect , staroffice has read and created files compatible with microsoft office very consistently in my experience , and it 's a whole lot less expensive . i am therefore hesitant to recommend microsoft office professional edtition 2003 to anyone except those who need the most advanced functions of excel and / or need to use access database frequently .

music pos 2.txt on one hand , this cd is a straight ahead instrumental rocker , but johnny a really shows how great he is with ballads , such as his covers of " wichita lineman , " and " yes it is. " in fact , those two ballads alone are worth the price of the cd by themselves . but johnny a can flat kick your ass , too . he 's a biker and his tunes like oh yeah , in the wind and two wheel horse are named for his other hobby . and they rock , but there 's nothing cliched or tired in his style . he always seems to be looking for new ways to say something . i saw him in person at the triple door in seattle sometime in february 2005 in a power trio format and he played most of the tunes on this album . the guy is one amazing guitar player . he played his signature gibson hollow body , fitted with a vibrato tailpiece ( bigsby ? it was like the old chet atkins " country gentleman " model ) and he utilized a battery of foot pedal effects , coming eventually through a pair of marshall combo amps . the guy had some of the best clean tones i 've ever heard from anyone , anywhere . basically , johnny a is a guitarist who has complete command of the instrument . and he 's got a rocking soul that cuts loose on originals and covers alike in a style that 's all his own , and that 's saying something these days . if you love great rocking / rockabilly guitar , combined with really cool ballad playing in the power trio format , this cd is just what you 're looking for . in fact , i guarantee you 'll be knocked out . five stars .

books pos 725.txt ( 3.75 ) the other reviews can reveal what this book is about . what i wanted to share is the extreme responses this book incited in my boyfriend and me . he alternately found himself loving the narrator , yuriko 's sister , for her brutal honesty and hating her for her malice and psychological bullying of kazue . meanwhile , i found myself rooting the narrator on as she spoke the cruel truth about the pitiful hopelessness of kazue 's meritocratic dreams , but a moment later i wondered if that made me a bully myself or as bitter and heartless as the narrator . perhaps it reminded me too much of what i had seen growing up to shock me . then , there was the simultaneous hilarity and pain of kazue 's cluelessness . was she a tragic figure , blind , or both ? i admired kirino for inspiring me to feel so much for her characters , even for yuriko , who is certainly not the ditsy airhead her older sister wants us to believe she is ( i also found it hard to believ she was as ghastly as she considered herself in her 30s : is it just because women past 25 in japan are regarded as christmas cake , as a friend from japan says ? ) . my attention was quite strained by zhang 's tale of chinese hardship ( it seemed the wrong book to educate the reader about how difficult it is for immigrants in japan ) , but i immediately forgave kirino when yuriko 's older sister admitted herself zhang 's account was tedious and could be skipped ( i 'd recommend others to skim it as well ) . again , my patience was tested by kazue 's journal : i just kept on thinking , are n't you ready to die yet ? but i see this was intentional on kirino 's part , to make the reader struggle between our ( or my ) wanting kazue to just give up on life and our feeling ashamed for our coldness and complicity in her bullying . it also made my boyfriend and me think concurrently of the people we loved in our own lives who were heading towards the same fate as kazue and yuriko , not through prostitution but through drugs . what did disappoint me in the end was the last chapter , which seemed a cop-out . if only an editor had suggested it was unconvincing and encouraged her that an alternative , though more shocking , would be more in line with the narrator 's character , but that is wishful thinking on my part . when i give this book to others , which i will , i will make sure to discuss with them , when they 've finished , what they thought of the ending . this book could have been edited down a hundred pages ( back when it was written in japanese ) , but for what it did offer , i have no regrets for its consuming my attention entirely and will always look forward to further translations of kirino 's books . this book may not be the masterpiece " out " was , but for anyone who has gone to an elite school on scholarship , striven to remain a petite zero , wanted to excel while recognizing how off-the-mark our values of judgment are , or wondered just how much her body could be worth , reading " grotesque " is just as powerful an experience as reading " out " was

music pos 700.txt it all started when i was a little kid and my dad gave me this album ( he was n't a fan , he probably picked it up with a crate of used records . ) it was one of my first exposures to rock and roll . nearly 30 years later i still own the original vinyl ( the one that had the exploding fire extinguisher rooster album cover . ) i am glad to have it now on cd , the vinyl being about as scratched and pitted as can possibly be and still be remotely playable . i dissent the reviewers who praise ducann over crane , for really , it is after all vincent crane 's project ( crane , also organist for crazy world of arthur brown . ) a keyboard player myself i consider crane one of my biggest influences and i hold great admiration for his playing . ducann and hammond also deserve praise for their performances , but it should be painfully obvious who the star of an organ driven rock band is : um , the audience ... er , no the organist ! take a trip back in time and enjoy this classic work
software neg 135.txt i purchased this software thinking that i could take my digital images , create a slide show with music , and then burn it to dvd for the family to watch . unfortunately , the disk that i got gave me some error messages that when i called tech support ( one hour hold time ) they told me that my error message meant that i could create files , but they 'll only run on my computer , not on my tv dvd player . in addition , you need to buy additional dvd burning software , because the dvd burning software imbedded in this software package will only create dvds that will run on a dvd player with the microsoft logo on them .

music neg 418.txt this album is one of the only live albums that i do n't have . i have heard samples , and a few extra songs on other cds though . the first thing i hear from somebody that tell about this album is basically that stevie could n't have been more high . his performance was just imbarrassing for the other members in the group ( specifically reese wynans ) . most poeple do n't know this but , on the old vinyl copy of this album , ( i 've never heard it but someone told me ) there was originally a 14th track . it was the song that usually comes close to the end of stevie 's sets . the song was life without you . since it was the very last song , i 'm guessing stevie was more pooped than ever beacause it was the last song and that he was extremely high and everything . being high is one thing , but being high and playing your last song in a set is terrible . in the old vinyl disc , stevie was on his last song and he was so terribly slow that reese wynans walked off stage embarrased and discusted . this track was taken off the album because of its discracefulness

camera neg 255.txt i have been working with this camera for about a year now , for product shots online , and while sometimes it takes great pics , many times the flash pops and whites out , or it goes off and you get a black picture . i take pictures of jewelry , and if i try to shoot a piece with green and blue coloration , the color is not accurate . purple is another color this camera does not accurately pic up . while you can fiddle with 4 different picture taking settings , in all different modes , you 'll never get the same picture twice , even saving the setting . the light has to be just so , to get a good shot . when it shoots clearly , it can take fabulous pictures , but often , pics are blurred as many others have said , when they actually come out . my old camera , the dsc p71 3.2 megapixel is much better , colors are accurate always , shooting is flawless and foolproof every time , and the greatest feature is re-sizing your picture and trimming right on the camera before uploading . this feature is completely missing from the dsc p200 , which was the biggest disappointment , as i figured it would be a given i did n't have to ask about when purchasing . why would sony eliminate this great function ? had i know that when the salesman at the large new york city photo store told me this was the camera i dreamed of , i would not have bought it . i prefer also to use the rechargable aa batteries instead of the lithium battery , which is super hard to load , and charging this camera is a nightmare with the charger it comes with . it is like a puzzle trying to get the charger inserted at just the right angle . every time it takes me several minutes , and finding a good little wall charger for it is also a problem . i recently took this camera on vacation to take pics and get footage for burning to dvd . sound quality is good , but video quality can be choppy , and the monitor did not let me even see that my setting was overexposed , so all my footage is somewhat overexposed for the entire trips shootings i made . the monitor , while big , does not show you always what you are shooting , whether a still , or movie picture . overall , i would not recommend this camera and i actually bought a used second of my old camera , and got my original repaired , because this one does n't compare . this camera is a bit too complicated and not very user friendly . even after using all this time , i still am not sure what i am going to get when i use this camera . i 'd say the worst features to be aware of are for someone who needs accurate color , this camera clearly has trouble showing blue / green shades , and purples accurately , you can never show these colors are they are in life with this camera , and the lack of the " trimming " resizing feature , what was sony thinking ? next time , i am trying something other than sony cybershot unless i hear they have gone back to making a great straightforward , uncomplicated easy to point and shoot camera . this one is definitely not

dvd neg 462.txt the review on the cover of the dvd reads " a snappy , sexy thriller.. . " i must disagree . this was the most unsexy , and unthrilling movie i 've seen in a long time . in my opinion ashley judd doses not fit this roll , it 's almost comedic . twisted is poorly written and losely held to gether by okay acting . seems the actors were doing the best they could with what they had . i have no doubt the producers and director felt the story had potential but they failed to realize that with this production . the film 's ending holds an interesting twist but too many lose ends are left to the viewers imagination . my vote ? just okay , nothing to write home about

books pos 287.txt as a history major ( undergrad ) and former high school history teacher , i marvel at crichton 's ability book after book to research a topic down to the bone then flesh it out in an utterly believable and compelling way . for this reason the great train robbery is for me my favorite crichton work , even though it may lack the polish of jurassic park or congo or one of his more recent books . tgtr takes us to 19th century london and gives us a plausible behind the scenes look both at the masterminding of this incredible train robbery , as well as life in general in 19th century london . so often history books give names , dates , connections , but leave one with the question , " yes , but what was it like ? " crichton answers this better than any book i ever read on the sheep enclosure act or most any other dry text . some of it may be fanciful , but it certainly seemed as well supported as many another full blown history text . at any rate , i highly recommend this book for any crichton fan , master criminal fan , or interested history student . the main character , whose name escapes me , alone is a grand study and reminiscent of a larger than life character from a hugo or dumas novel . very fascinating and rapidly moving .
camera neg 98.txt hello all , lens hoods are pretty much a necessity , but this has to be the mostly poorly made hood i 've ever used . unlike other hoods that screw on , this one requires you to press to opposing clips and then slide the hood one , and release the clips . this leads to problems of alignment , meaning both sides of the clip need to be perfectly aligned in order for the hood to fit right . although it 's a pain and i hate...i do n't really have another alternative . either go w / o a hood , or take this one . either way , guess i 'd rather have a hood on the lense than not having one
books neg 452.txt it 's always easy to criticize somebody 's personal choises when it comes to the movies and the stars , but this book is dedicated to the most unforgettable actresses and not stars of the studio era . so it comes pretty natural to ask : is esther williams such an unforgettable actress that the author had to overlook margaret sullavan ? was grace kelly 's talent so overwhelming to forget that miriam hopkins had such an individuality in the acting process that she kept on working with such directors as lubitsch , wyler , mamoulian , hawks and vidor to stunning results ? what was wrong with mary astor 's acting and what is right with kim novak 's ? actress to me means patricia neal or shelley winters - norma shearer or natalie wood were stars....think about it
health pos 573.txt i purchased this hair dryer for an unusual reason : my old 1875 watt conair was actually too much wattage for my bathroom ( the circuit kept tripping ) , so i was actually looking for a dryer with less wattage . however , i did n't want to sacrifice power , as i hoped not to have to devote any additional drying time to my shoulder-length hair . so far , i 've been pleased with this hair dryer . it does seem a bit louder than my previous model- -not obnoxiously so , just a higher , more concentrated fan noise . the dryer is extremely light and compact ; it 's actually smaller than my folding travel dryer . it is very basic , with a choice of high / low settings only ( there is no heat / cool option ) , but it seems to dry my hair just as efficiently as my old higher-wattage dryer . overall , this is a very good basic hair dryer which gives you a wide variety of use options for a great price
camera pos 122.txt if you are shooting with a compact chip camera like the 20d or rebel xt , you will be happier with the 8mm fisheye . this 15mm fisheye will just be a really distorted wide angle lens due to the 1.6 factor . if you love the fish eye style and have that camera , you 'll need something wider to compensate for your smaller chip . i was disapointed with this lens for that reason . the sigma 8mm is great . a note to the reviewer below . sigma makes some good lenses and bad ones . this is a good one and you probably got a bad copy . it happens often enough with sigma gear . with this lens , its good to go and try one at your local camera shop and make sure it has the style you want . bring your camera with a chip in it and take a few shots and go home to check them out . decide if you like the style and if that piece of glass is a good copy . i got a good copy and was still disapointed because of my lack of knowledge . sounds like you got a bad one

dvd pos 354.txt i enjoyed this wholeheartedly . mainly because wwe did a little tweak on the formula . instead of mimicking the one-time use of the flair dvd formula or using the formula that everyone else gets this three disc sets spreads everything around . all the featured stars get their own video package highlighting parts of their career that made them famous or recognizable . then every wrestler gets their own match , some of which overlap which makes things interesting . although we do see some perennial " best of " favorites it was nice to see some obscure pieces of footage . who would have guessed sal bellomo would be on a dvd in the 2000's . if wwe continues releases with rarer footage , i think they 'll have a better chance at impressing the older members of the fanbase

software pos 99.txt i decided to get this office suite after using it recently . i 've usually worked on office 97 and 2000 , but the 2003 version has some pretty cool features not found in the older versions . the feature that i really enjoy is the pivot report feature in ms access , which was n't in ms access 2000. this is a truly great reporting feature . you can now use access as a front-end to slice and dice data stored on data warehouses in oracle , sql server , sybase and other enterprise-type databases . if you 're used to creating crosstab reports , you 'll definitely like the pivot report feature . crosstabs are limited to 2 dimensions but there 's no limitation on the number of dimensions in pivot report . to me , the main drawback is the price . ( i did get mine at around $370 at j&r , which is a great price . ) i figure i can upgrade this in about 5 years time , which works out to about $70 to $75 per year ( assuming that i 'll be paying about $370 to upgrade in 5 years time . ) a big positive is that this is the industry standard . so the work you put into learning the multiple new features of word , excel , ms access is not wasted because you can reuse the same skills in another job . your time will be well spent . note that the software may seem bloated but the intelligent user is able to choose and pick the most useful and relevant features of each application and ignore the features that are not useful . different features are useful to different people.. . another positive : each product in office professional is fully programmable using visual basic for applications ( vba ) which you can use to build custom programs . this very powerful feature is sometimes overlooked when shopping for office suites .

books neg 118.txt apparently the difference between a criminal act ( theft ) and moral redistribution of income is 1 ) who you steal from ( stealing from the wealthy , of course , is moral - - according to rawls and bolsheviks ) , and 2 ) who receives the loot ( the non-wealthy makes it moral ) , and 3 ) who commits the act ( the state / society , of course also makes theft moral ; example - taxation ) , and 4 ) your intentions ( redistribution of income ) . to look at this another way , if your neighbor breaks into your house and steals your money , that 's a crime ( unless your neighbor is poor - - which would then be moral and justice , according to rawls ' formula ) . if the community comes into your house and steals from you , it 's legal and moral justice , again , according to rawls . because , according to rawls , if , before you were born , you were to vote with everyone on how physical world society should be structured , you 'd vote to have the state guarantee that everyone was equal , or they would be compensated somehow for being born ( unjustly ) less-equal . how ? by compensating those with less by stealing from those with more . so those with more would be like oh , say ... a milk-cow who gets milked to serve those with less . so those with more would become a resource , or state-owned slaves to those with less ... because " society " ( the robin hoods and rawls of the world ) deemed this as moral justice . rawls does not take into account those who are willing to take on risk , entrepreneurs , students of life who work to earn an " a " vs. students who earn an " f " . he points out that many people are born into difficult situations through no fault of their own . true . but that does not implicate those within society who are born into better situations as the cause , nor are those who are born into better situations responsible for making up the difference . forcing the " wealthier " ones to be accountable for the unfairness within life and pay the bill is n't justice or moral . it would simply be an unjust law . some people see rawls ' theory as a blueprint for a future generation utopia ( like the bolsheviks envisioned marxism ) . i see it as an insane blueprint for slavery , and a powerful dis-incentive for earning personal reward and merit . in a sense , this book is an argument against the individual . it sees the world through a blurred lense where the author only recognizes masses of people - - he does n't recognize any individuals ( unless they were born as victims ) . curious . how do you experience life ... as a group-mind ( an oxymoron if there ever was one ) , a collective ? or as a unique , isolated , independent , individual ? there should be societal incentives to help each other . okay . but when it is forced ( theft of property always implies force ) , it is no longer an issue of morality or justice - - it 's simply a law . without personal choice being involved there is no morality as an issue , by definition . transforming advantaged individuals into mules forced to carry the burdens of the world is a definition of justice for whom ?

software neg 230.txt i have owned eleven vcom products and from now on , they do n't have my business . the product touts itself in part as a vital tool when / if your machine crashes . if it does , be prepared to shell out the cost for another complete program . you are told that the program is already installed on another machine and you ca n't run it-although this occurs after a lengthy and cumbersome installation process . sadly , customer assistance is no help-emails are unanswered and you ca n't get through via phone...what you do get from them once you register are constant emails about new products . thanks , folks . version 6.0 is also much slower than version 5. support for 5.0 , by the way stopped abruptly when the new edition came out , despite the functionality of that program . for the price , the software should work like a major player , rather than a dollar bin special .

books pos 21.txt college stoner cult following aside , hunter s . thompson 's journalistic prowess was a vital national resource up until he left us last february . thompson was one of those brave few who dared to cut through popular media perceptions and glittery rhetoric and travel right to the ugly center of his subject material , counjouring hilarious allegories where the average journalist would already have soiled himself in disillusionment . on the campaign trail should be required reading for all those who hold a less skeptical view of american politics than say , the average wwe heavyweight title match , for a truly sane person should be no more shocked to hear of a politician lying or cheating to increase his presidential hopes than when the undertaker strikes his opponent with a steel chair when the referee turns his back . hunter has long since traveled through this looking glass - - although he can at times be found expressing nostalagia for the wide-eyed optimism of the 60s - - but the result is not nearly as depressing as it is hilarious . the image of thompson infiltrating the nixon youth at the rnc and yelling obscenities and death threats at rival journalist john chancellor 's press box while surrounded by hundreds of kids chanting " four more years ! " was one of the funniest any book has offered me in a while . how does the cliche go - - " the more things change , the more they stay the same " ? after the thorough spanking of george mcgovern at the hands of richard nixon , hst credits the most staggering blow to mcgovern 's presidential hopes to a media crisis involving his vice-presidential nominee , thomas eagleton . just days after eagleton was named as mcgovern 's running mate , two democratic campaign managers received phone calls revealing that eagleton had gone through intensive psychiatric treatment on three separate occasions . as the story spread like wildfire throughout the press , mcgovern 's presidential hopes were dealt a blow from which they would never recover . since then , we 've seen willie horton and the swift boat veterans come out to haunt their respective candidates , and one is inclined to wonder who the democratic " mascot " will be for the 2008 race . perhaps a mentally disabled child whose tricycle was crushed by the car of hillary clinton ? a dominican prostitute who gave joe biden the clap ? but i digress . i give on the campaign trail 4 out of 5 stars because the book , like presidential campaigns themselves , can at times seem uneventful . thompson addresses this from time to time , wondering aloud what it was that made him want to cover politics in the first place before remembering that the rush one feels from being a part of a winning political team is nearly identical to that of a junkie getting that long-needed fix . other parts of the book will only make sense to the more hardcore followers of politics . for instance , hst 's extensive interview with campaign manager rick stearns , where stearns explains the intricacies of acquiring state delegates , reads like hieroglyphics to me .
camera pos 627.txt got this camera in 1999 and it is still doing very well ! more than 3000 great pictures have been taken . the camera is very easy to use and needs no maintenance . a word of caution - ensure that the camera does n't get pressurized laterally - this can happen if it is stuffed in a bag and someone sleeps over it . the spring-operated shutter is very sensitive . would recommend this for anyone who is looking for a cost-effective and easy-to-use film camera

dvd pos 269.txt there are plenty of anti-bush films and books around . if you only shall see or read one , this must be the best pick . i like michael moore very much , but he is not really a political heavyweighter . and i do n't think fahrenheit 9 / 11 is his best work , it does not mix humour and political insight as well as the book " stupid white men " for instance . it is more like two or three movies in one . william karel is a political heavyweighter and he does not try to make anything more than a documentary . but what a documentary it has turned out to be . very disturbing insights from informed sources , among them former cia-agents . it is not usual to hear such plain speaking from " people in high places " just a few years after the events . this film is perhaps not as entertaining as fahrenheit 9 / 11 , but far more informative .

books pos 272.txt i can not put into words what this journal of the truth has done for me as a african-american male living in the united states of america . i was introduced to this book by a man of guyanese decent who knew i needed to read this book . i have to admit it was a difficult read because my primary education only spoke of american history and there was no mentioning of any african-caribbean contributors from the " middle passage " period . now , at thirty-nine many things are clearer to me . " roots " and " beloved " are historic , well-documented treasures and need to be used in educating all children no matter race , creed or color . to make sure what i read had some semblance of truth while in puerto rico i visited a sugar mill in guanica and my heart just melted . if you read the book you will understand my feelings . i became angry because something as simple as not being forthwith with documented history such as this to young minds of american children lead to misunderstandings amongst the masses hailing from africa , south america , the caribbean , asia , united states and europe . eric williams i know i can not thank you in person because you are no longer here physically but your spirit lives on in your books and you will always be alive everytime one more person reads your book and awaken " thank you " ! for everyone else read the book it will cleanse your soul and feed your mind . once you finish this read " how europe underdeveloped africa " by the same author

camera pos 79.txt i bought this lens to go with my canon digital rebel xt . i absolutely love this lens . i got it to try some insect and other macro shots and it has served this purpose very well . with some practice this lens will produce fantastic macros with some great bokeh to boot . i read the other reviews and must say that i have never scared an insect away with the noise as mentioned before . and i have taken countless insect shots with this lens . it is a bit louder than the other lenses i have but i do n't see it to be a problem . the one problem i do encounter is when using the autofocus in a busy closeup scene it often will focus on the background instead of say a closer insect on a flower . when this happens i just flip it to manual and focus that way . no big deal . overall , great lens for an even greater price . definitely worth it . ( i submitted a photo of a bee that i took a couple of days ago with this lens as an example . )

music pos 607.txt leo kottke is a national treasure . he is our greatest living solo acoustic guitar virtuoso . having said that , you 'd expect his cds to be at a very high level of brilliance . i have at least a dozen of his titles . if there is any trouble in deciding the merits of any one disc , it 's because there are so many kottke releases to choose from . " one guitar , no vocals " clearly ranks as one of the best . the compositions tickle my brain , warm my heart , and put a bounce into my step . the guitar playing is dazzling . you really get a glimpse of the man behind the guitar by listening to this music - brilliant , thoughtful , odd , complex , quirky , a huge heart , and the wackiest sense of humor . it 's spirited music , so thoroughly drenched in the personality of its creator that it 's unmistakably and immediately recognizable as leo . the world is full of acoustic guitar instrumentalists these days . some of them are quite excellent . many are not . but there is only one leo kottke . and his guitar music is a gift to the world . a very strong recommendation for this cd

software pos 782.txt ms put office 2007 on a dvd rather than a cd so there is only one disk , so they make the installation easier right off the bat . unlike all previous versions of office , you do not have to get into the details of what options you want . in previous versions , if you did n't make sure you installed all the features , when you went to do a function that was n't installed , you had to dig out your office disks and install the feature . a huge pain , but not anymore . the installation is hands down the easiest of all versions of office . you do n't have to tell it manually where to find your files . you do n't have to manually put in your favorite buttons . it 's all done for you . yes it takes some getting use to the new layout of the functions , but once you figure them out , it is so nice and smooth . this version is light years better than all previous versions . the most impressive part of the installation is outlook 2007. in all previous versions , you had to export and import all your files and contacts . anyone who experienced this , knows that it never went that smooth . sometimes it was awful and you lost emails and contacts in the transfer , and the time it took to do this , was very painful . this is not the case with outlook 2007. just load the program and it does all the transfers from your previous version of outlook . you do n't have to do a thing , and you 're up and running without missing a beat when the program is done loading . you will be shocked how simple it is . anything new has it 's growing pains to learn , but once you do , you will be very glad you made the change

music pos 278.txt for the longest time , i have thought that observational truths were highly prone to being the most piercing of things : i have believed that the truth could either hurt ( or disturb ) you terribly , or make you laugh so hard , to the point of hysteria- -or a combination of both extremes . there are many things to put this theory to the test , but to cut it all short , all one would need to do ( if by chance it has n't been done already ) is experience the observational humor of richard pryor to possibly get a better understanding of what i am talking about . this classic comedy album from 1975 is a prime example . richard pryor has been hailed as a genius by many , and i would have to agree : it takes plenty of intelligence and natural talent to be a comedian for starters , but to also turn many disturbing observational truths of everyday life into something painfully , body-breakingly hilarious takes a whole lot of something as well . from the very beginning , to the tail-end of this cd , 1975 's _is it something i said ? _ is a non-stop laugh fest , that personally gets *me* laughing so loud and hard , i end up pretty much abusing almost every part of my body in the process : my throat , my lungs , my sides , my stomach- -they all end up feeling beaten and worn-out . richard 's takes on drugs , sex , race & racism , relationships , and politics in general are every bit as painfully observational as they are profane- -and did i mention hilarious ? the racy quality of the material found here makes so much of what 's referred to as " cutting-edge " these days , seem so contrived and unaffecting ; richard 's observations seem just as relevant now- -if not more so- -as they were 30 years ago . i could n't be graphic in pointing out some of the sickeningly funny moments on this disc - - and there are many - - but i should say that the opening one-two punch of " eulogy , " and " shortage of white people , " and richard 's take on his own battle with cocaine addiction in the " cocaine " bit get me cracking up so hysterically , i sometimes need to be careful not to make myself sick . and again , those are just a few of the many hysterical blasts found here . richard pryor is considered a comedic legend for a reason . this album here is a good example as to why he is considered as such . just do n't play it for the kids , and for the love of god *don't * play it during the middle of the night ; you most certainly will disturb the beauty rest of your family , and your neighbors . and you know what could happen if you disturb one person 's beauty rest : just imagine what would happen if you disturbed the beauty rest of many. .

software pos 869.txt this edition of the color calibration hardware and software is very professional - a fact that is reflected in the price tag . however , the difference between the uncalibrated and calibrated states on a television is very noticeable . the kit includes the colorimeter ( color measurement device ) with a usb connection . the assumption here is that a laptop or nearby desktop is available to calibrate the televisions . the software makes calibration extremely easy . it allows the user to select which color and picture controls the tv allows them to use ( not all televisions present the same controls , and even then , they often have different names ) and modifies its process accordingly . calibration takes approximately 30-45 minutes , but the results are undeniably an improvement . the kit comes in a sturdy plastic case with foam cutouts for the hardware and software ( much like a stargate sg-1 case for an alien device : - ) ) . while expensive , the software and hardware can be used on nearly anything that displays a picture - tvs of any kind and computer monitors - without limit . the one caveat is that , for lcd and other tvs or monitors with " delicate " screens , the suction cup provided to stick the colorimeter to the device requires a good deal of force . in fact , the force required is more than i am comfortable with applying to any display i have , except crts . as such , calibration requires one to either hold the colorimeter to the tv for each measurement ( not really a problem ) , or buy the tripod for the device . this is the only downside . this device is definitely of professional quality and is a must for any home theater enthusiast or the perfectionist in your household . it might even be possible to recover the cost of the unit by becoming a calibration technician.. . : -

dvd neg 16.txt first of all , this is not the worst movie ever made , nor even the worst movie ever made that was given a budget and some name stars . the worst movie ever made was " autumn in new york " , but that is a different review . no , this not a great movie , but it is very interesting . and for once , thank god , it does n't end with everything tied up in a pretty hollywood bow where everthing works out for everyone . it has a gritty sort of realism that transcends the walk through performances of the stars of the movie . and the scenery works well for the overall feel of the movie , bleak . more interestingly for me and others of my generation who grew up with the brat pack , this marked the end of these actors forays into trying to do the teenager thing . for molly ringwald , she did n't do anything of note again until " the stand " six years later , and for andrew mccarthy , well it could be argued that he still has n't starred in anything of note again ( although he probably made some money from " weekend at bernies " i & ii ) . anyway , probably better to rent than buy , i am only buying it to complete my 80 's collection .
health pos 688.txt i bought this product specifically because it was originally described as being / having " mood-brightening natural spectrum light . " i thought it would help on the gloomy pacific northwest winter days . i got it on a friday sale price , so it seemed like a good value for the product description given here . the lamp just arrived ( a few days ago - when i originally submitted this review ) , and the product 's faq sheet states this product is " designed only to provide excellent quality light for daily tasks and hobbies . this lamp does *not* offer the correct level of light intensity specified by the national institute of mental health for the treatment of seasonal affective disorder ( s.a.d. ) . the product literature packed with the lamp has no mention at all that this product offers " mood-brightening " light . because of this glaring misrepresentation , i am currently debating whether to the return the lamp . i agree with the other reviewer that the adhesive labels ( there are two ) are very sticky and difficult to remove completely . i used a combination of methods to remove the adhesive residue . and i agree with the comments about the company name being printed on the front of the lamp . when i saw it in the picture , i thought it had to be some kind of company watermark or logo for the stock photo only , so i was shocked to see " verilux " actually printed / embossed into the lamp housing , in a very prominent location on the front of the lamp . very cheesy , for a lamp of this price point and quality . if you 're looking for a " clean " bright light , in a stylish , portable lamp , this is not a bad choice . but if you 're looking for a full-spectrum light that does offer some light " therapy , " this is probably the wrong choice . the company does have other , " therapeutic " lighting options , but at a higher price point . nov 1 , 2006 update - i was concerned enough about the original , misleading product description that i submitted my concerns to amazon . i now see that the description had been revised since submitting those concerns . i want to thank amazon for their very prompt response in correcting the product description , which should help other buyers make a more-informed decision .
music pos 20.txt i had tears in my eyes when i first heard this album . i get emotional over music i really like , and this album got to me.so many great standards so well delivered by the duo . they deliberately chose slower ballads for this album so do n't look for uptempo , snappy songs in this one.not that harry warren could not write faster stuff like jeepers creepers , shuffling off to buffalo etc. this album is to sing along with softly or hum.i kept thinking of bogart in the rain in casablanca and other lovers in w.wii.i know the main tune in that movie was not by harry warren ; it simply reminded me of great love tunes from that era by julie styne[time after time] and the grossly underrated harry warren.grab someone you love , some good wine and savor one of the great popular composers and a great duo.they should do more harry warren albums , michael and george.i thank them profusely

books neg 825.txt i love how many people like to say that lawrence walsh was a republican . funny . he was an eisenhower republican worlds removed from the conservative movement . and let 's face it : he stink bombed george h.w. bush at the end of the 1992 campaign when bush was gaining ground on clinton . i 'm not saying bush would have won if walsh had n't indicted caspar weinberger on the friday before the election , but walsh made a next-to-impossible task unattainable for bush . bush got him back , of course , by pardoning weinberger on christmas eve , 1992. the beginning of the book was interesting to say the least . as it wore on , however , it became a prosecutor hoping to go down in history whining about republicans . let 's face it : people in power tend to be corrupt . they have protection the rest of us do n't have . this was n't just true about reagan and bush ; it 's true about clinton and whoever you wish to name . about halfway through the book , walsh concentrates his fire on the guy who was vp at the time , ghw bush . i also find the fact it was endorsed by a number of liberals interesting to say the least . i guess when you ca n't beat a guy at the ballot box , you impeach him or at least try to . right ? not worth the investment of time or money - but does have some good historical information inside .

music pos 44.txt wow , this album takes me back to the fall of ' 79 , around the same time as mj was taking over the world with his scorching solo debut " off the wall " ! ! both of these albums got heavy rotation on my turntable and were house party essentials when i was a 15 yr old kid spinning the hot joints of the day ! at this time , prince was still a virtual unknown to the mainstream , but to a hip urban audience comprised mostly of blacks , gays , and ultra-hip whites who really knew what time it was , this lp served as notice that a " new thang " was brewin ' in minneapolis that was going to take the pop world by storm in a few short years ! from the opening track , " i wanna be your lover " , his first big single ( gold ) to the rockin ' " why you wanna treat me so bad ? " , which also was a single and a true fan fave ! - - to " sexy dancer " which was sure to bring everybody to the dance floor and into a frenzy ! prince then cools down the mood with " when we 're dancing close and slow " , which is just beautiful with its sparse piano and acoustic 12-string guitar- -one of his many underrated slow jams of all time ! then side 2 opened with the pretty " with you " and into the scorching rockalistic ode to female bisexuality. . " bambi " , which still knocks me for a loop ! i 've had the pleasure of seeing him perform this song live twice down through the years. . once in 1980 during his " dirty mind tour " and again in 1992 during his " nude tour " while i was overseas ! - -awesome ! ! then there 's what i call " the great triplicate " ... " still waiting " ( another underrated slow classic ! ) , followed by what is to me , the definitive version of " i feel for you " ( no disrespect to the great chaka khan ! ) , followed by another underrated slow jam masterpiece " it 's gonna be lonely " , which still sends me today at 41 the same as it did when i first heard it at 15 ! this album was prince 's first platinum album , proving that he ( at only 22 ) was indeed a hitmaker and one to watch ! this album and the next one , " dirty mind " , served as a changing of the gaurd from the older established innovators of that day like stevie wonder , earth , wind & fire and parliament / funkadelic , etc. & is an essential if your collecting prince classics ! in fact , you ca n't go wrong with this kat between his debut , 1978 's " for you " to 1987 's " sign o ' the times " ...it just does n't get any better !

software neg 838.txt this operating system was one of the most unsatisfactory i have ever used- -including dos , win 3.1 , windows 95 and windows 98. aside from being incompatible with older hardware , xp home edition crashes frequently-particularly if you like to work with several windows open at once . most important , the program is highly susceptible to viruses and hackers . preventing these two problems requires expensive add-on software and hardware . true enough , the built-in firewall ought to work . but in my case , hackers got in anyway . i had to hire an expensive data recovery guru-another story in itself . even reinstalling the program did not solve the problem . my computer was completely compromised . i was eventually forced to junk the machine . after my dreadful experience with xp home edition , i have sworn off windows forever . mac and linux are both far superior

dvd neg 116.txt the old dvd from 1997 looks better than the new hd version . i 've compared the two , and the first dvd had good color saturation , dark blacks and looked right with the heavy red and brown palette . the hd version has a blue-green haze covering everything and the picture is too bright . they also removed the film grain and made the image look smooth and creamy . the sound quality is better now , though , and the image of course is higher resolution .

health pos 772.txt my hair is very wavy and frizzy , i have to condition my hair every day so it does n't look dry and damaged . 2 weeks ago i got my hair cut , the stylist used a sedu straightener on me . wow ! suddenly , my hair was stick straight and super glossy ( really brought out the natural highlights ) . i bought one from him for $199 ( should have checked the internet first ) . i 've tried a cheap flat iron before ; after wrestling with it for 40 minutes and pulling the heck out of my hair , all i got was slightly " pressed " hair . the sedu iron has super smooth ionic plates , so it glides through your hair very easily , quickly and smoothly . no more pulling of my hair . i can give myself smooth , gorgeous , in about 5 minutes . another plus is that the style will stay until the next time you wash your hair ; now i only have to straighten my hair every other day . sure , sedu is on the expensive side , but this salon-quality tool is more than worth it . look good and feel good every day !
health pos 381.txt i have a few minor quibbles with this razor , but it gives you a nice close , comfortable shave . and is n't that what we want in the end ? i do n't know anyone who buys one of these things for its " ergonomic design features . " it holds the charge for a good long time , and shaves your face nice . rinse it clean with running water and you 're done . that 's what i 'm looking for . the only things keeping me from a 5 star review is i 'm not yet comfortable with how the razor sounds when running . it seems like it 's always needing a charge...but that 's how it sounds at full charge . it will take some getting used to i guess..others might find the quiet running mode a plus . also , the monthly cleaning of the cutters / combs is a bit complicated .
dvd pos 706.txt ...that you simply have to see , " mrs miniver " being one , a little known film dealing with a fictitious german invasion to a sweet english village , " went the day well ? " and this film . why so ? because all 3 were made at the start of the war ( early 40 's ) when england stood very much alone in the fight agaisnt hitler and aggresive facism . invasion fears were rife , the war effort looked hopeless at times as in europe , hitler opposing country after country fell to the german aggressors ( not to mention the rampage going on in africa at the hands of rommel aided by the italian forces under mussolini 's instruction ) . england 's small island identity stood alone and under threat and was bombed , starved and demoralised into feeling invasion could happen any day . it was quite possibly the darkest of times in english history and these three films capture the flavour of that dispondancy but equally the might of the will to survive and protect , with realistic perfection . in which we serve does this more personally as we know it is based in truth and the characters become dear and well rounded quite quickly , inspiring us to care about these folk from many walks of british life . for a modern audience it may seem a little over stoic and sentimental at times but place the emotion in context of the year it was made ( 1942 ) , and i guarantee you will view it an aching sense of fear and hope which was precisely coward 's plan . an absolute gem and a must see , i weep every time i watch it
music pos 544.txt first off , to the above comments , while i thoroughly enjoyed your well articulated history lessons , and would be interested to read other history lessons from you , you have to realize that this story is not directly based off of the 300 spartans at thermopolye , but of the graphic novel . now this is not to say that it is historily accurate in some sense , but the movie is tuned more to the direction of the graphic novell itself . **** caution spoiler alert ***** besides that the soundtrack is amazing and it is always a joy to listen to a soundtrack that really captivates the real emotion of that particular scene , i especially enjoyed the music when they fight the " beasts " and it is really hard rock , and i especially loved the ending music when the entire spartan army is gathered and the one spartan is telling them to remember leonidas ( it is called remember us on the soundtrack ) . may we all find our own " glorius death

software pos 913.txt well presented , easy to follow along , and easy to revisit previous lessons . videos and illustrated fretboard really help see and hear how the song should be played . not a lot of depth in the material but probably about the right level to maintain the attention of most students . some of the accompanyment / singing could be better but overall does a good job presenting the music so the student can practice along . some of the material / songs may not be to everyones liking , but again , these are okay for the beginner . the singing can be a slight destraction sometimes . i probably would n't recommend this to be the only source of learning guitar....and i do n't think most people buying it would think it 's all the will every need to become a great guitar player . i 'm sure a teacher would still be very advantageous especially when it comes to pointing out bad habits that may creep into the new students technique . i 'm trying to learn without a teacher as well and have found other music books very useful . bottom line ; this is a good product and provides a good start at learning to play the guitar .

books neg 709.txt the book starts off ok with a good introduction of the various api 's and is ok reading up untill chapter 6 " programming linux audio " . this is where the book fails terribly . none of the audio samples will compile and the information about openal is just plain wrong . first the function used to open a wav file is no the corerct function to use for linux . the author uses the win32 version . this is just the start of the openal errors . minus one star ! second the book 's two websites ( one of which no longer exists ( loki ) ) contains no errata and no way to contact the author . the only information is avalible is a zip file of the books sample files ( which do not compile of course ) . minus two stars ! ohter things about the book that did not work for me was the fact that the author uses c instead of c++. while c is still used for game development , most programmers are attempting to migrate to c++ and ood . books released about 1950 should reflect that ! second the author uses tcl as a game scripting engine . while i can agree to a point ( based on the fact of the easy of implementation ) the author should have used a common scripting engine such as lua . ( although the author does mention at the end of the book that tcl was proably a bad idea . third the author should have introduced autoconf very early in the book instead of waiting untill chapter 10. the main thing that i liked about the book was the good intro to programming with linux in general . the topics of linux debugging and makefiles i thought was good ( assuming you have experince in these areas on other platfoms ) . also the coverage of sdl was a pretty good intro .
camera neg 918.txt i purchased this case for my dscs90. i hate it ! it is only big enough to hold the camera and nothing else . there is no handle to the case , in fact the case only has zippers and you are suppose to use the strap from the camera itself for the handle . the zippers do not stay in place and the camera can easily fall out of the case so i do n't recommend doing this . look for a better case for your new camera .
camera neg 876.txt i bought a sony icd-mx20 digital voice recorder a week ago . i was surprised that sony does not provide downloads of the associated software named " digital voice editor " . sony customer service staff told me that if you lost the cd that came with the box , you had to buy a new one . only patches of the software are available to download . the customer service personnel told me that it was corporate policy despite the fact that the software is bound to the digital device . this immoral policy violating the norm of digital appliance industries and should not be encouraged . sony is demoting its brand name by offering poor post-sales services . think twice before making your buying decision .
books neg 908.txt ' introducing postmodernism ' is a good source to gather names of philosophers , architects , artists , anthropologists , linguists , and everyone in between that have been somehow connected to pm . the problem , and it is a big one , is that this style of tour de force writing does little to contextualize all these diverse disciplines . sure , if you only have half an hour to read up on pm , you can whip through this book and go on with your life . but if you 're wanting to really absorb the phenomenon , and perhaps go on to read more , this book is not the place to start . check out david harvey 's ' condition of postmodernism . ' this will rip the top of your head clean off ! it 's much more weighty ( in every sense of the word ) , but your understanding of pm will vastly improve , and will better prepare you to go on to other important writers of the ' genre '

music pos 350.txt there is a reason why styx was the first musical act to have 4 triple platinum albums in row ! find out why . they are a unique band , with their own uncatagorizable style and sound . not hard rock , but can rock . not pop , but catchy melodies and great three part harmony . not art rock , but themed concepts in their writing and dramatic tempo changes and crescendos in their music . it is probably true that lady was the first power ballad , though styx was not credited for it . lady paved the way for other rock bands to showcase their softer sides . perhaps styx was not always successful in their attempts , but they took chances artistically and musically and should be given props for doing so . every song on this cd is great ; however the two that stand out for me are too much time on my hands and suite madame blue . most people who have spent time in neighborhood bar will would likely agree that too much time on my hands is witty , funny , and true . suite madame blue a song which is a metaphor for the united states is simply one of the greatest rock songs ever ! ! the lyrics of suite madame blue are as powerful as the music , and this song contains all the elements which made styx great
dvd pos 773.txt war exposed some violence simmering within one gulf war veteran . christian bale is electrifying as jim , a tough-minded ex-ranger whose brutal nature did n't subside after his return home to la . they say war changes a man . this might be evident here , but it feels more like the fighting only unleashed the demons inside of jim . along with his buddy mike ( freddy rodriguez ) , the two tear through the town , bingeing on drugs and alcohol . their is no deep plot here , just a couple of ruffians going around town looking for jobs . but it is a great character study , watching jim self-destruct . bale is great in this type of role , like he was in american psycho or the machinist . i liked this movie much more than training day , which this director previously wrote the screenplay for
music neg 549.txt most people seem to like the soundtrack from " glory " , but this fact does not necessarily make " glory " a great , or even good soundtrack...most people also like the food served atmacdonald 's , but no intelligent person would argue in favor of thier menu as being good or great based on numbers...it is something to put in one 's mouth whenever nothing better is available and one is hungry...the same might be said regarding " glory " ...if one 's tastes run to choir music , almost any gregorian chant album is head and shoulders above the insipid choir music to be found here...as for the themes , they are commonplace variations , often bootlegged from other scores by the same composer , or new work that the composer later bootlegged into other scores , so , all in all , the effort plays rather like a buffet offering at a cheap , " homestyle " diner...the film , on the other hand , was well done , and , apparently , from reading many of the other reviews here , the unwarranted praise owes more to satisfaction with the film itself , rather than very much stand-alone praise for the score.horner has written a lot of really , really beautiful and original scores , but perhaps because most of his best efforts have been for small or little-noticed movies these have not been recognised for thier greatness...so , in sum , we are left with a very popular film , provided with a very mundane score by an award winning composer
music pos 558.txt i hesitated for so long to get this . having followed moby 's rise since circa 1994 it has been amazing to watch what an impact he has had on music and on various cultural media over the years . i like his early techno / rave stuff and have enjoyed the gift he has for using electronica to score some beautiful and haunting hymns . but i wondered : has moby gone soft ? has he sold out ? i was pleasantly surprised . look at the cover and add rain . that 's the overall mood of this album . i find rain to be cleansing on many levels , often building a mood of pensiveness , reflection and a fragile peacefulness . there is a glorious melancholy in the music , the lyrics and the singing on the album . take the chilled out moments from moby 's other albums and build on it . that 's what he 's done here . almost every song has singing - primarily moby 's longing , almost cyring , voice - and almost every song is for those rainy nights , when the world does n't make sense , when longing for companionship and understanding burdens the heart , yet with a subtle hope underneath it all . it 's downtempo , mellow , moody and sometimes sad . but it is beautiful . do n't expect " old " moby , do n't look for the commercial jingles of play . just put it on and listen

camera pos 89.txt this lens has gotten some bad reviews , i think , partly because it is starting to show it 's age . this was the first usm is lens , and the technology has really grown since then . if canon were to come along with an updated 75-300 usm is lens , man , it would blow everything away . that being said , yes , this lens is a little slow to focus . but , if you are not using it for work like one of the professional sports photographers you see on the sidelines at baseball games , you should be okay . it also could use an extra stop ( or two , or three ! ) because when you are handholding , you need that aperture to be as open as it can be . all of this aside , i really have gotten some gems of pictures out of this lens . it lets you get as closer then you possibly could hope for . if you have asteady hand and plently of availible light , you can get some really nice shots . if you are in a low light situation.. . you will need a tripod . the is of lens works.. . pretty good , but i have had a number of ever so slightly blurry pictures that would n't have been had there been some more aperature room to play with . all in all , its a good starter telephoto lens , especially for digital slrs since it really extends the zoom on those . its great for the price , and when you decide to upgrade to one of those white canon l beauties , just sell it

books neg 608.txt i admit that i tried to read this twice and failed both times . i got to around page 20 or so . i 'll probably try again . however , if you 're an adult who has already read other philosophies i would suggest attempting to read it just so you 'll know what objectivism is about . i would n't suggest it for teens that have n't had any prior readings , though . objectivism is about the self and about " reason " , and it can be heady stuff for someone who has no real experience in anything else . the strange thing about the tone of the writing is that it comes across as venomous . i assume that 's in my head , but judge for yourself . her caricatures of " the witch doctor " ( who controls others from a spiritual perspective ) and " attila " ( who controls by brute force ) are actually interesting . wrong , but interesting . since objectivists rely on reason alone for their survival ( or think they do , anyway ) , it 's rather surprising the lack of logical thinking early in the book . my suggestion is to attempt to read it without dismissing her out of hand ( she 's not wrong on everything ) , or swallowing it all without using your own critical thinking skills . judging by previous reviews , it seems there were plenty of both kinds of readers . if you buy into it , you can get a feeling of superiority over others in a kind of pseudo-intellectual way . if you do n't buy into it , however , you 're evil ( either the witch doctor or attila ) and probably just too stupid to " get it " . why i did n't finish it yet.. . i just could n't get past her ignorance of history , frankly . if you 're writing a work of fiction , the historical innacuracies do n't matter , but this is n't supposed to be fiction . i like history and most people do n't , so it probably wo n't bother most people . also , while she denounces religion , ms. rand has no problem hopping up to the pulpit herself . like all other religions and cults , the world is messed up basically because people do n't think like she does .

music neg 410.txt i wo n't go into a long diatribe . suffice it to say that when i listened to this upon its release earlier this year , i was disappointed . i gave it a few more close listens and find that the musical quality is not great . this is more a photo of dylan as a free-spirit . there 's a point where baez messes up a song . ( i do n't have anything against baez . that being said , i do n't have much for her either . ) there 's joking and laughing , but really , i do n't need a double-disk of acoustic material that seems to be performed by someone who sounds like he 'd rather be in the audience than performing . you can almost sense why dylan went electric in this concert . the bootlegs prior to this are superior and i would suggest that if you are n't a die-hard dylan fan to stick with them . if you really like dylan 's acoustic work and not his electric stuff , you should be pleased with this double-disc . i love dylan , but not enough to enjoy this over and over again . i 'll go to disk one of the 4th bootleg for my acoustic fix
books neg 242.txt i know that as a wolf-lover i am a bit biased , but i would still like to say that this book is stupid and incorrect . you see , in this story , three children are left alone . a wolf disguised as their grandmother tricks them into letting him in , because he wants to eat them . unfortunately , that 's where this seemingly charming book starts going downhill . this is just another stupid book that , summed up , says " wolves are evil , ugly beasts who attack people ! ! we have to kill them all before they gorge themselves on our children ! " yep , the wolf is depicted as evil in this book . why could n't they make it something that actually hurts people , like a bear or a mountain lion ? ignorance , that 's why . the wolf is also depicted as stupid and easy to trick in this book . see , near the end , the children try to trick the wolf by telling him he can become immortal by eating gingko nuts . they plan on luring him into their trap , to get rid of him . the wolf instantly falls for it , which is lame . wolves are among the most intelligent and perceptive animals on earth ! it 's practically traditional to make children 's books with wolves as villains , and the chinese seem to loath wolves , but this book crosses the line . do n't let your kids read it unless you want them to think wolves are savage , stupid , man-eating beasts . if they already think so , you 'd be neglecting mankind 's need to know things even more by letting them read it . in other words , it 's a terrible book .
music pos 211.txt as he did with " parade " , the soundtrack to his last vanity project " under the cherry moon " , prince provides a musically invigorating soundtrack to " graffiti bridge " , which is a hopelessly silly film . no matter . " graffiti bridge " , prince 's first album of the 90 's , is also one of prince 's best albums of the 90's . " new power generation " serves as the title track to prince 's new band , and it 's a powerful , funky manifesto . " the question of u " is exotic and intoxicating . " elephants and flowers " is an upbeat song about spiritual redemption , whereas " tick tick bang " is prince at his most joyously raunchy . although most of prince 's material is exceptionally strong here , the collaborations and contributions by other artists are a mixed bag . " we can funk " is a simmering duet between prince and funkmaster george clinton , and tevin campbell provides some youthful exuberance to " round and round " . but the tracks by the time mostly fall flat . i 've personally always found morris day to be a one-trick pony with his effete pimp routine , and his one trick gets boring quickly . it 's obvious that with " graffiti bridge " prince is trying to create the feel and atmosphere of a funky block party . but i ca n't help but wonder , without the tracks featuring other artists , if " graffiti bridge " would n't be more highly regarded as one of prince 's better albums

dvd pos 453.txt i enjoyed francis veber 's ' the closet ' - released in france in 2001 - for two reasons . first , it features an all-star ensemble of french acting , certainly a tribute to veber 's skill as a director . just take a gander at the first six names to appear on the imdb credits : daniel auteuil .... françois pignon gérard depardieu .... félix santini thierry lhermitte .... guillaume michèle laroque .... mlle bertrand michel aumont .... belone , the neighbour jean rochefort .... kopel , the director imagine a movie where the great jean rochefort gets slotted sixth . each of these six stars can carry a movie in france on their own back . the fact that the group has teamed here is a testament to veber 's reputation . his previous release , 1998 's ' the dinner game , ' was lauded far and wide as a comedic masterpiece . actors get attracted to that type of skill . the second reason i got a kick out of watching ' the closet' : i just learned that ' bend it like beckham ' writing partners gurinder chadha and paul mayeda berges are prepping a uk re-make for the screen for a targeted 2006 release , with chadha at the helm . her keen eye for comedy tinged with poignancy was confirmed by beckham 's runaway success , so i feel like i 'm in on a really great secret knowing she 's working on a re-make .
software neg 688.txt normally i might wait to install a new software upgrade , but i just got a new laptop and thought it would be best to use office 2007 with the new vista operating system . i was wrong . you would expect that a multi-billion dollar company like microsoft could put out a powerful and bug-free piece of software . but after a month of using office 2007 , you get the distinct impression that this software is not ready for public release . microsoft should be ashamed . i do n't know the root cause of my problems , but i have to stress that i am running a clean install of office 2007 on vista , so there should n't be any software conflicts or issues . so what are my issues ? the list is long : - - my biggest concern is that ms word constantly hangs and stalls . it can making editing a document very painful . i suspect the problem is when i put images or visio diagrams into a document . but that is something the old ms word was able to do without an issue . oddly , if i have a colleague open the document and save it out in word 2003 , the problem goes away ! what ? ! it 's killing my productivity . - - when ever i cut and paste from an old document , word hangs for 15 to 20 seconds . and often the formatting and margins in my new document go haywire . i keep having to spend a ton of time fixing things . this never happened in the old word . this is another time killer . - - every few days , outlook 2007 starts telling me that it cannot display my email folders . uh oh ! i have to completely restart my computer to see my email again . - - outlook 2007 breaks many graphic emails that people send - - they look like a mess . it is because outlook 2007 does not render html correctly since it uses the word engine , not internet explorer to display email . i have no idea why microsoft did this , but they have got to fix it . - - many of the issues in the old word 2003 still have n't been fixed . if you place an image , it can often be hard to get it to appear correctly . why ca n't they solve this one ? - - while most office programs have the new ribbon interface ( which i like ) , some programs like visio 2007 do not . so you have to remember how to use two interfaces . could n't microsoft find the time and money to update all its programs ? give me a break . - - on a few occassions in visio 2007 , my files have failed to save correctly . at first i thought this must have been my fault , but it 's happened to me a few times and ca n't be a coincidence . a few times i 've gotten an error message and lost my work . ug. - - word and excel 2007 use a completely new file format . so anyone you send a document to has to have 2007 installed ( which is n't likely the case ) . to get around this , you can save it down to a 2003 file format , but then you end up with two files on your hard drive - - one in the new format and one in the old format . what a pain ! also , there definitely seems to be an issue with office 2007 opening older office 2003 files . could be the cause of many of my problems , but there is no way i can avoid using old files . they should have worked harder on compatibility . there are good things about the new 2007. i do like the new interface design and the new features in outlook 2007 are amazing for organizing tasks and sharing your calendar . but i do n't think it 's fair that microsoft released a product so full of serious , serious bugs that have cost me hours and hours of extra work . i did n't spend hundreds of dollars on a beta product and do n't think the public should have to suffer . surely they can afford to do better ! new addition to my review : today i discovered that i can no longer paste excel charts into word like i used to . when i try , the chart goes in , but any bars / lines disappear .

dvd pos 411.txt crackerjack courtroom trial drama based on a true story of three australian soldiers in the boer war accused of killing prisoners and a dutch minister . the british command is obviously using the three as scapegoats to convince the germans , who seem eager to join the war on the side of the boers , to stay out . the men claim they were only following orders , orders which went against " normal " military practice . this is a new type of warfare : the boers fought as guerrillas , not in uniform , not by " the rules . " the australians on trial felt they were engaging them on those terms . the morality of war itself , therefore , is just as much on trial as these men . they all lose in the end . the trial scenes are well paced , and the use of flashback creates just the right amount of tension . also there are enough shady gray areas to keep the proceedings interesting . well worth a watch

books neg 467.txt i picked this up because it 's considered a classic and i knew it had been made into a movie . i tend to think that if a book is made into a movie , then the book must be pretty good . not so with howard 's end. the plot in howard 's end does n't progress much outside of an early death and later marraige . you have to have some interest in the characters , but they just were n't very believeable . none of characters convinced me that they could be people from the real world . i kept waiting for someone to say anything that might border on being interesting , but everyone babbles on and on about nothing of any substance . the story is clearly dated and does n't hold up well so many years later . living in today 's world , it 's hard to understand what attracted margaret to henry . there definately is an audience for this book . i 'm just not a part of it
books neg 226.txt flynn offers up a fast-paced , if unbelievable story . unfortunately , character development is paper thin and clearly portrays flynn 's political preferences . characters , like rapp , with a military background are guided by clearly defined ethical principles , have all the answers and are always showing those good-for-nothing politicians how the " real world " works . meanwhile , flynn 's politicians ( the majority of whom are democrats ) seem only concerned with public opinion and the next election . while there are grains of truth in his characters , flynn consistently goes for the cheap , partisan stereotype . i was looking for a well-developed political / military thriller . i 'm still looking .

camera neg 628.txt not too long after i purchased this camera the screen turned white when i turned it on . i would turn it off and on and nothing would help . finally i would take the batteries out and put them back in . this seemed to fix the problem a few times . after that i thought it was just operator error . but it wasn't . the camera finally gave out and the white screen never went away . so after being annoyed i left the camera alone for awhile . an event came up about a month later . i got my camera and tried to turn it on . nothing happened . so i changed the batteries . still nothing happened . i 'm not sure what happened . i do believe i purchased a lemon camera . i 'm hoping to resolve these issues with samsung . it was one of the cheapest cameras on the market at the time . so i guess you get what you pay for !
music pos 96.txt i recently saw them in san francisco just like one of the other reviewers , and i thought it was astonishing . i know a lot of people got mad cause they didnt move around or anything , i mean it could n't be because they were trying to concentrate or anything like that ! the great thing about this album is that all the instruments standout at the same time . farina ( the lead singer ) has calmed down after the last couple of albums and often times speaks his lyrics in a soft and heartfelt way that make you wish you could get into a conversation with him right then and there.and his guitar playing has even matures after the bed is in the ocean . the drummer just flat out rocks . his punctuality is a lot of the reason why these guys are so tight . the bass speaks just as well as the guitar does and sometimes takes over as the guitar holds it together and the bassist go off on his own little excursion . well , if you have a problem with a band not rocking out , i dont know what to tell you . it is jazzy , but let me be the one to tell you this is the best jazz i 've heard . i think this is the only path they could of taken . you got to evolve . sometimes that cant always be a good thing but in this case , karate is the exception . love this

dvd neg 203.txt i only gave this movie one star because it is against amazon 's rules to give it no stars . after hearing that this was a christian movie , i could not wait to watch it . however , this movie has nothing in common with christianity , quite the contrary , this is the most anti-christian movie that i have ever seen ; it promotes murder and other unsurpassable evil . the movie started out horribly and just continued to get worse . for instance , the beginning of the movie was shockingly pornographic . in a supposedly " christian " movie i did not expect to be bombarded with this . after seeing this i did not expect that the movie could possibly get worse . however , i was greatly mistaken . later in the movie the main character , who was remarkably unsympathetic , met several of her christian co-workers who were talking about something they called " the pearl dream . " intrigued , the main character asked them what this dream was . of course , they were unable to answer because it is complete nonsense . none the less , the main character continues to review what her co-workers have told her about christianity over the years . as the movie plods along , generally confusing and boring the viewer , she comes to the decision to give up her sinful lifestyle and turn to god . when this event transpired i assumed , wrongly , that from this point forward the film would redeem its beginning and maybe even say something good about christianity . this , however , is where the movie went form being merely bad to astoundingly sacrilegious . then , the main character and her young daughter set out for the desert . due to a vague dream , they believed that this was god 's will and that he would appear in the desert and take them to heaven , in other words " rapture " them . how they came to this assumption i was never quite sure . the movie often made ludicrous statements which never made the slightest amount of sense . i became extremely weary trying to deduce what was happening . nothing that took place in this movie was remotely biblical nor was it well explained . as time passed our characters continued to sit in the desert , boring the viewer to tears . they begin to suspect that god was not coming to gather them to heaven and they started to despair . this is where the movie became intolerably anti-christian ; the mother took her daughter up to a mountain and asked her to kneel . she then forced her daughter to pray . after the prayer was concluded she took a gun from her dress and shot her crying daughter , supposedly to send her to heaven . she " believes " that she is doing god 's will . obviously , she was such an idiot that she failed to read that the bible that strictly forbids murder . afterwards , she is sent to prison , where we hope to see her suffer for her cruel , viscous , and insurmountably stupid act . as she is sitting in her cell , blaming god for the murder of her daughter , that she willingly committed ( if she had half a brain cell she would have realized that she was doing satan 's will , not god 's ) , she hears trumpets and the cell walls start to fall in . a few scenes pass , in which the ghost of her daughter returns and tries to redeem her faith . she , however , refuses . then , she is taken to a dark room , that the viewer is supposed to believe is some supernatural place where judgment takes place , and asks if she loves god . she replies no , because she blames him for her insanity . the film concludes with her standing stupidly in a dark room , that failed to represent eternity . most of the aspects included in the film were never explained . such as the significance of " the pearl dream . " nor was it explained why they believed that they needed to wait in the desert . how did they contrive this ridiculous idea from a vague , ambiguous , and utterly vapid dream anyway ? none of these questions were ever answered . this caused the film to feel incomplete . the stories between scenes shifted so drastically that i suspected i had missed several important scenes . after checking my dvd i realized that i had not accidentally skipped crucial scenes , because their were none . this film was deliberately ambiguous and vapid . also , the special effects , cinematography , and acting were about as good as a preschool play . none of the actors put any emotion into their roles . they recited their lines like drugged zombies ; i suppose even they realized it was complete rubbish and decided not to put much effort into it . to state the obvious , this film is a disgrace ! obviously , it is not biblically based . it does not represent christian philosophy which is to love others , not to wander around aimlessly in the desert acting like a fool . nor do christians promote murder , as this film implied . this movie has as much religious value as night of the blind nazi zombies . i am ashamed to see that such a complete travesty is labeled a christian film . this film is extremely anti-christian ; its main objective is to give the world the false impression that fundamentalist christians are brainwashed and are incapable of sane thoughts . this is not true , and yes , i can prove it . all the proof that you need is contained in the bible . if you stop hardening your heart and truly listen with an open mind then you cannot help but to see jesus loving message for the world . he does not desire to bring misery to the world , but happiness and love . the reason that there is misery in the world is because people , like those who made this film , disobey god . if we followed his loving rules then we would not suffer . i do not write this rather long review out of hatred , as i am sure many will accuse me of . i write this to warn people what this movie is really about . it is not a true christian movie like the left behind 's and the passion of the christ . and , yes i am aware that i will be bombarded by a slough of negative votes . however , i do not even faintly care . my beliefs , as a fundamentalist christian and my love of god is more important to me than a number on a page . also , i was shocked to read the other reviews on this forum , especially the one from the wiccan woman who said that she wished to see christians thrown to the lions as they were in the time of the romans . i have seen a lot of hatred in my life but her review was by far the worst i have ever see . christians love the world and those in it , we do not tell non-christians about christ to imply that we are " holier than thou " because we are not . all are equal under god 's eyes . we are all sinners and the only way to attain redemption is to accept god 's undeserved grace . we tell other people about god 's undeserved love because we want to save them and see them living in eternal joy in heaven . we do not rejoice to see people unsaved , we tell them about their condition because we want to see them saved . in other words , we tell people because we love them . also , for those of you who accuse christians of having a hatred of the world , why do you spew hatred in everything you say toward christians ? are n't you displaying the hatred that you claim you abhor ? in conclusion , this is the worst movie ever made . it is anti-christian , immensely sacrilegious , poorly acted , poorly written , vapid , mind numbingly dull , disjointed , tortuously long , etc. in short , this film is an abomination . it is massively offensive to christians and is a massive misrepresentation of christian values . also , the acting is abysmal and the story line hopelessly confusing . if you wish to watch a film that accurately portrays christian values then i recommend watch " the passion of the christ " or the left behind movies . i hope that this review will help you ; it was written with love and concern . i shall keep you in my prayers . have a wonderful new year . in christ , ravenova also recommended : the left behind and the ravenloft book series

dvd neg 681.txt i really like bruce campbell and his movies like army of darkness . but this movie is not in the same league . first of all the plot is slow and boring . bruce does not have the same rouge character that he is so good at . instead the movie is filled with frankly depressing scenes of him in bed or limping around barely able to move . this really hampers the action aspects of the movie . the dialogue aspect is not much better . if you like bruce , my advise is to get his other movies or try to get a hold of the tv episodes of " jack of all trades " episodes . it is a lot more fun and has the " real " bruce
music neg 228.txt just listening to the samples of this new remix of " gold:35th anniversary edition ~ the carpenters " i found it to be in my opinion sadly remixed very badly . certainly not a tribute to the excellent talent of karen carpenter and richard as well . i wonder what richard was thinking when he remixed these songs ? as another review noticed and i agree with , is the bass on some is so loud it almost drowns out the pure excellence of karen 's deep resounding truly perfect voice . this is not a cd you want to get if you really want to appreciate the true pure sound of the carpenters . the older cds ( if still in production or if you can find them used ) " carpenters classics 25th anniversary " a 2 cd disc 98:04 minute collection remastered digitally , is a much better pick . especially for those who remember the carpenters when karen was still alive and the original arrangements were nothing to mess with . the other cd 's worth finding of the carpendters especially if you like the talent of karen 's deep resounding perfect voice , would be the cd " voice of the heart " this is a hautingly beautiful collection of love songs by karen who lets each song touch your heart and soul making you feel as if you were right there as she sings each song . the other one i would highly recommend , if christmas is your holiday , would be " carpenters christmas portrait " ... " special edition digital version....celebrating 70 continuious minutes of the seasons best.. . " with karen and richard . there are 34 carpenters songs as timeless as their sound , and 11 performances heard on this holiday cd for the first time . these cds are all the songs you fell in love with the first time you heard karen sing . these are the arrangements so beautifully done with her and richard . this new remix maybe ok if you have not been familiar with how wonderful the original songs the carpenter 's recorded and later remastered-not remixed - sounded . for this reason i give this 35th anniversary remix a 2 star rating . these older cds are how the carpenders really won over their fans , took the music industry by storm and gave a generation of music lovers reason to love the carpenders music and the sound they gave each song . talent that can still win over anyone who truly appreciates the timeless talents only the carpenters could deliver . as i more or less said in my title for this review and taken from an old saying " if it ai n't broke do n't fix it ! " or in this case do n't remix it !
camera pos 941.txt i received this product in a timely manner . it was exactly what i needed . thank you
books pos 276.txt i have only read the swedish translation of what i suppose is the " old edition " , but judging by " look inside this book " , this new english-language edition incorporates much material from the old . incidentally , the swedish edition gives the authors name as kallistos ware , apparently his taken orthodox name , while timothy ware is his original , given name . in sweden , the swedish translation of " the orthodox church " is the only readily available book on the history of the orthodox church . apparently , its used informally as a textbook in some college classes on church history . it also contains chapters on theology and worship . in my opinion , the book is a necessary introduction for those interested in orthodox church history . its first chapters summarize the history of this church during the byzantine empire , under islam , and in russia both before and during communism . of particular interest is the authors interpretation of the catholic-orthodox split , usually dated to 1054. the author believes that the so-called fourth crusade in 1204 was the real and final consummation of this split . however , the book must also be read with some reservations . the author is , after all , an orthodox christian himself . its safe to assume that there is a certain bias here and there . for instance , ware denies that the byzantine church was caesaropapist , a very untenable suggestion . at other times , he is surprisingly " liberal " for an orthodox . for instance , he paints mehmet fatih , the muslim conqueror of constantinople , as a very tolerant ruler . i also wonder about his interpretation of the church father cyprian . even so , " the orthodox church " remains an indepensable book for those looking for a short and concise historical over-view of this remarkable christian church .
music neg 422.txt i heard stories about michelle branch before trying out her music . and i was electrified to find out that there is still a young , honest and rock-ish female artist out there working her way up . first off all , i 'd like to say i wish to remain objective to all other listeners ' opinion , so yup...criticism is welcomed . i 'd like to let people know what kind of a viewer is writing this particular review too . basically , my main influences are bon jovi , the goo goo dolls and elo . i 'm a 17-year-old male . hotel paper is one big step for michelle . she evidentally matured her music between " spirit room " and this . michelle is pretty much at the state where she ca n't really make big steps on her own . and that 's why i think her authorities are limiting her potentials by pushing her to mainstream . like the fact that she wrote so many catchy , boring and good-to-sell singles that wo n't last and are only appealing to listerners on the shallow side . although some of her songs made me perfectly convinced that she can write decent music . ( tuesday morning , drop in the ocean , hotel paper ) some peeps are saying how michelle is n't quite a super songwriter nor a guitarist . i agree . imo , many of her riffs are boring and unoriginal . even a noob guitarist like me could tell . but afterall , it 's pop , so that 's inevitable . but she could do much much better than that . her lyrics are ok since she does n't write no emo nor punk junk , but a lot of complaining and childish relationships . most are ok though . what i 'm saying is , she most definetly has her own style...but sadly , it 's surpressed at an extent where it 's irritating and makes me feel like killing those studio dudes that are spending way too much time laying their hands on michelle 's music . nevertheless , just because michelle is young and writes her own songs and plays the " guitar " , does n't mean you gotta try her music out . but sadly , that 's exactly how a lot of people out there got attracted . i believe it 's more about how you like the music . i ca n't stress the fact that michelle is a musician with great potential and future . but to me , it seems like she 's throwing those away for popularity . one good example is , as prolly you 've already heard...the posing for a men 's magazine named m- -- -. whatever she was thinking , it really crushed my impressions on michelle...the cute musical lady she used to be....and the terrible decision of forming a pseudo-country rock band with her friend . michelle is talented and hella good compared to the other you-know-who female artists , but let 's get real here...she has a long way to go . she most certainly is capable of going far and i really do hope one day i 'll be listening to her matured and true music . afterall , imo , it 's only the matter of time before she surpasses amanda marshall on my list . i really hope michelle could get out of this situation and unchain from this game the studio peeps are playing on her and make every song and every note the way she always wants to . " tuesday morning " 3.5 / 5 " hotel paper " 4 / 5 the rest are just mediocre

camera pos 727.txt i got a pair of these for christmas . initially , i was skeptical about the quality of an inexpensive roof-prism optic , and this is n't my favorite brand name either . but contrary to my expectations , i 've been extremely impressed with them so far . good brightness , contrast , sharpness , field of view , and close focus all exceeded my expectations for a binocular at this price point . feel , fit and finish are all very good . i wear eyeglasses , and these binoculars still deliver a nice wide view through the eyepiece . the twist-down eyecups are quick to extend / retract if you are sharing these with someone who does n't wear glasses . they come with a decent carry case , and relative to porro-prism types , the weight and compactness are both a little bit better . if you are looking for a good binocular for birding or general use , i highly recommend you take a look through these in addition to the other popular models . i think these really hit the sweet spot for price / size / weight / performance , and i 'm very happy with them

dvd pos 628.txt the essence of painter francis bacon is not a personal life lived on the sordid side but how he was forced to take in life . seen through his central nervous system and eyes , we experience his world of fragments , like collage pieces of existence . the only place he could make those fragments whole was in a painting . otherwise , he was wholly inable to put a fully realized human being , himself , together . tellingly , one of his best friends comments that he has done a superb one-on-one job with his lover george in his paintings of george . however , he has been unable to do that in his actual life lived with george ! that sums up bacon , his art and his life , in a nutshell . bacon is not a person you will like but you will understand him and how the fragments of his existence made for great art . yet he is also the most alone person imaginable , something no amount of lovers and sordid excess could allay . one of the very best films about an artist ever made . you do n't need to see the actual finished paintings since it is the fragments he used to build his paintings in his head that matter here . if you want to see his paintings , you should be able to find page after page of them online in about a minute , or less , using any visual search engine

books neg 734.txt i too read the ta for tots to my 3-5 year-old 30 years ago . she loved it a lot so i 've been looking for it again , this time for my grand-daughter . even though the title is different from the original one i knew , i purchased it and read it as soon as i received it . bottomline : this story is _not_ the original one and i do n't like it at all . other than showing stereotypical happy prince and princess fairy tale characters ( which i can live with up to a point ) , i saw bunches of red flags when i got to the evil witch , drawn with a full-blown ugly face " who was very clever and devised a very wicked plan " . unhappy because there are so many happy warm-fuzzy people around she freely starts giving away cold pricklies . without enough warm fuzzies ( we read earlier ) it puts people " in danger of developing a sickness in their backs which caused them to shrivel up and die " . ouch . so instead of embracing the wisdom of old women , here we have another story that villifies them ( ok , i 'm a psychotherapist also and know all too well how these images affect us all ) . no , it 's not funny , and there is no way i would introduce this book to any child . the book also does not do a good job of showing clear examples of what warm fuzzies and cold pricklies really are , as the original book did . too bad , for using images of " warm fuzzies " and " cold pricklies " is an easy way to introduce feelings and consequences of behaviors to young children . i am returning the book .
camera neg 788.txt i had high expectations when purchasing a laser range finder for use on the golf course . after a lot of research , i settled on the pro tour laser . as previous reviewers have stated , this unit is very hard to stabilize . i have a feeling this is true of all lasers . even with supporting both elbows on the hood of a car i found this unit very hard to find yardages for objects beyond 150 yards paricularly when bright sunlight is present . on the golf course , finding the flag and obtaining a yardage at longer yardages is almost impossible if there are objects behind the flag such as trees or landscaping . this unit has been returned and i have gone to a standard handheld gps instead . once the center of the green is initially saved as a waypoint , this is a very reliable and quick method to get a yardage , you just have to convert feet or 1 / 100 's of a mile into yards . i do this with a chart taped on the back of the gps . accuracy is about 2-4 yards which is good enough for anyone but a vey low handicapper . i am staying away from a laser finder until golf courses uniformly put reflectors on their poles .

music pos 635.txt a friend of mine at work just recently introduced me to the music of chris rea via this very nice best of comp . he also recommended getting his road to hell cd . both of these cd 's were money well spent . i 'm surprised that this artist flew by my radar screen in the 80 's when he was at the peak of his songwriting and popularity , mainly due to his top 20 hit " fool ( if you think it 's over ) " . for some reason i never equated that song with this artist . the thing i like most about rea is his musical diversity . he can lay down a very memorable am pop hit like " fool " or " let 's dance " and then turn around and make a great blues rock album like " road to hell " . no matter what the genre of music , this artist is very good at laying down a nice groove . there 's plenty of catchy tunes to be found throughout this cd . " auberge " and especially the wonderful " on the beach " stuck out for me . but you get many styles here . and each song sets a different mood . from the easy listening " winter song " or the catchy " looking for summer " . or some excellent blues rock like " road to hell " , " god 's great banana skin " or the excellent instrumental hidden track at the end of the cd that shows off rea 's tasty slide guitar skills . i do n't know how i missed this artist after all of these years . but i 'm a new rea fan who now looks forward to his next album . whatever style that it might be , i 'm betting it will have some versatile playing and some very well composed melodies like this superb best of. this is a nice place to start listening to this fine artist . if your like me , after hearing this cd you 'll probably want to search out some of his individual albums . i 've since picked up his late 80 's album " dancing with strangers " . another very nice cd . most of the music on this best of cd is almost 20 years old , but it feels like it could have been written today . in other words it 's well composed music that holds up very well over time . and i 'm sure if your like me and not familiar with rea 's music , the minute you hear " fool " or " on the beach " it 's going to bring the good part of the 80 's back to you . greatest hits cd 's should all be this good . highly recommended
music neg 305.txt a friend of mine turned me on to spoon , and at first i listened enthusicatically.. . but then i got bored . although spoon 's songs may be catchy at times , they are empty and deviod of any alterations . the same simple drum beat mixed with the same simple guitar riff may be appealing for a minute or so , but in the end i do n't think i 've ever listened to an entire track . if this is 5 star music today , our culture is severely lacking depth

music pos 60.txt attell is one of the few decent comics out there right now . i was n't that big of a fan until i saw this in a record store and decided to give it a shot . i 'm running out of comedy albums , there 's not that many good ones out there . so i bought it and i was impressed . the audience is obviously drunken college kids who were very familiar with the show " insomniac " . they would laugh and scream if just slammed the microphone into his forehead the whole night . he has very good timing and delivery though and his jokes have very unpredictable punchlines for the first time you are hearing them . you never see the punchline coming a mile away . he is vulgar so if you are sensitive in any way to graphic sexual scenarios and profanity , stay away . he is one of the few that i enjoy now , tragically mitch hedberg died in march because he was another . the increasingly popular dane cook does n't do it for me . cook 's retaliation cd has broken all sorts of records for a comedy album . i think cook is very marketable to the college , 20something crowd , guys like him because he 's the loud obnoxious drinking buddy from the frat , chicks think he 's cute . i recommomend attell myself , he is vulgar but is just a better comedian
dvd pos 96.txt one of the best-directed films of 2006 , " kiss kiss bang bang " is built for multiple viewings and perhaps for cult audiences . and even though " kiss kiss bang bang " may require multiple viewings just to catch all of the rapid-fire dialogue , or to untangle the plot , one of the best reasons for multiple viewings is to admire the directorial skill : it 's a class-a tutorial for amateur filmmakers or simply armchair film-buffs who will appreciate the highwire juggling act that shane black pulls off here , with " kkbb " ' s sudden shifts of tone from slapstick to dead-serious drama to gallows-comedy . if that seems like an easy feat , well.. . remember " 1941 " ? not even spielberg got it right . but shane black nails it here - - and it 's his directorial debut . downey & kilmer are also at the top of their game here , but it 's michelle monaghan who impresses with a flat-out great performance that keeps up with the veterans . " sui generis " ( one-of-a-kind ) is the phrase that best describes " kiss kiss bang bang , " although it 's remarkably mainstream at times . it 's a showcase of talents for everyone involved , and when the bullets are n't flying , there 's even a romantic comedy here & social commentary to boot . i ca n't think of any other film quite like it - - and that 's just how the warner brothers tradition seems to work ( at its best ) .

software neg 312.txt my last roxio product was " easy cd creator 5. " when i switched to a mac i naturally expected " toast " to be the mac version of this product . i am extremely disappointed to find that the crippled video editing features in my ( many years old ) version of cd creator is miles ahead of what they include with the most current and up to date version of " toast " which i unfortunately own . it allowed me to edit video clips , create several levels of customizable menus , customize the size of compression , and burn to a dvd which played on my standard dvd player . toast can create one uncustomizable menu level , has no editing , and locks up every time you drag a file into it . they ( in the product description ) say it reads mpegs but it 's more like it freezes every time it sees an mpeg . it does n't even read every mpeg reliably . the only thing i can find that roxio adds to toast that is n't in my old version of cd creator is more enhanced mp3 and music features ( which is n't what i bought it for ) . i may have been better off using " parallels " in combination with cd creator . i am sorry but compared to roxio 's cd creator ( which is basically the same price ) , toast seems to have been designed by total idiots . and i always thought that mac software was better for working with multimedia
dvd pos 43.txt i actually did n't mind kiss the girls because of morgan freeman . he saved the day in that movie . plus , i 'm always intrigued by serial killers and weird psychos . that always peaks my interest . but ashley judd 's performance was just terrible in that ( not that i think she 's very good in anything i 've seen but whatever ) . that 's why i was delighted to find another thriller along those lines with morgan freeman , still playing alex cross , but thankfully without ashely judd ( a better name for her would be ashely dudd but that 's my opinion ) . along came a spider was not only an interesting storyline , it was also very well acted . there 's some twists of course which i wo n't spoil , but one i did see coming and the other blindsided me . all in all very enjoyable , especially for the low price i found this at . the little girl who is kidnapped in this , played by mika boorem , is terrific . it was kind of neat seeing her in this as i had just watched the movie sleepover recently ( also reviewed it...cute little movie...check it out ) where she 's more grown up . hopefully we 'll be seeing more things with her . anyway , i found this engrossing enough and most times you ca n't go wrong with morgan freeman ( except if ashely judd is in a scene with him , but that 's not his fault ) as he 's an exceptional actor . obsessed with serial killers , psychos and the like , just as i am ? then you will have a good time getting tangled up in the web of along came a spider

software neg 441.txt unlike years past , h&r block ( founded by a guy named bloch ) decided to charge $16 for each e-file , federal or state . only one version , " premium federal+state+e-file " includes a " free " federal e-file and state e-file ; but that version costs $70 , so there 's no free lunch at all . seriously , $16 is a lot to pay for e-filing . there are websites that give you completely free e-filing ; my favorite is taxact ( at taxactonline dot com ) . with taxact , you get the complete federal plus state package for $7.95 , which includes e-filing . or you can use their standard package to prepare federal and e-file for free , with *no* income restriction ! i do n't work for any of these companies , nor any tax-related company , nor any such entity . i just do n't think it 's right for h&r block to charge customers such a ridiculously high fee for e-filing , whereas people can e-file for free elsewhere . btw , if you use taxcut to prepare your return , you 'll have to use h&r block 's e-filing service if you want to e-file ; you ca n't just take your file to another website and expect that website to do it for you . i used taxact in the past and they are very dependable . you can find reviews of taxact products in major magazines and on major websites . good luck

dvd pos 90.txt when once and again first began i dismissed it as a show for just women . but after watching just one episode i found myself hooked . this was unlike any show i had seen before . i actually found myself drawn into the lives of these two families . once and again is not just a show about two divorced people who find each other and start to fall in love . it goes much deeper than that . once and again follows the lives of two divorced people and the lives of their children as well . but then it goes a step further and it follows the lives of their ex spouses as well . with the first season we see how the relationship begins to develop between lily ( sela ward ) and rick ( billy campbell ) and how their ex 's still play a factor in their love lives and how their blossoming relationship has an effect on their children . once and again was one of the finest dramas on television and if given the respect it deserved could still be growing strong today . even thought it 's time on television was short once and again showcased the acting talents of sela ward and billy campbell and launched the careers of shane west and evan rachel wood . i am just glad that we are able to enjoy this fine show on dvd and that they have finally decided to release seasons 2 and 3
camera neg 765.txt the case looks exactly as in the pictures above , and the camera fits perfectly in it . however , the case is hardly a protection , it 's not to be considered as more than a carrying bag . the velcro that keeps it closed is quite easy to open so i 've dropped the case a few times while walking outdoors . fortunately the case is designed to use the straps on the camera for carrying it around , so my camera stays with me in any event . there is a little strap on the case , supposedly to attach the case to the camera or to the straps , but it opens too easily , so it ca n't be trusted at all ( the strap almost opens by the very weight of the case , which is not much ) . there is also a small pocket in the back , providing barely room enough for a set of replacement batteries ( 4 aa batteries ) and the usb cable . again , the velcro on it is too easy to open , even more after placing the batteries and the cable inside the pocket . definitely , this is not designed as a practical solution . just enough to protect the camera from dust and some scratches . if you value your equipment and want to protect it from more than the wind and the sun , while not being worried of losing the case around -or its contents , do n't buy this one . spend some more money and get a decent carrying case . i will
dvd neg 111.txt my major gripe about this film comes down to the issue of easily exploitable weaknesses on the part of the vampires . these extremely frail villains get reduced to ash with the flash of a u-v lamp , vaporized with the slightest touch of silver on their skin , and melted down in less than a second by the light of the sun . vampires are supposed to be scary , but how frightened of them should i be if one can be taken out by throwing a clove of garlic at him . writers for future vampire movies should work on making these creatures of the night a bit more formidable . the first underworld movie would be a good model .
health pos 535.txt replacement blades are a must . the razor will remind you about once a year which is fine in most cases . but , if you have a heavy beard or shave more than once a day , as i do , then you should replace the blades every 8 months or so . the reminder on the razor is only a suggestion , not a command . after all , it does not know when the blades get dull . so , i simply ignore the reminder and replace the blades when i feel it is necessary . one thing you must do is use the new blades for several days until they settle in and adjust to your skin . until then you may have a little irritation . another problem i have solved is the hair on my neck . i use to think the harder i press the razor , the better it would get those stray hairs . but , all i got was a rash . i discovered that if i simply use a very light touch and not press hard then it got those hairs much better and with no redness . replace your blades at least once a year and your face with thank you
books neg 235.txt this is a complex and detailed history chiefly of cuban exiles in south florida and the influence they have been able to wield regionally and internationally with and without the help of various u.s. administrations . in that sense , it is the story of two cities - miami and washington - and two peoples - americans and cubans . i have an objection , though , with the stone-hard style in which this volume is so meticulously , even gorgeously at times , written . didion strives to be so achingly academic that there is little real heart to this book and , worse , the result is a cold , humorless , colorless story that is at times an unappealing example of ideological abstractions and alphabet soup . the author , in her conspicuously clean and parenthetical prose , apparently is so charged by the subject of her research that she has forgotten there are people on the other end - readers . it is , in that sense , a boring little disaster of a book .

dvd pos 720.txt how good is angelina jolie in this film ? it is a testament to this young actor 's presence that even as dark and soul sickened and gloriously decaying as her character is , there is not a frame in this film that does n't feel her infection . winona rider is equally excellent as the psychologically confused ( or is it enlightened ? ) hero forced to navigate the depths of her own psyche . the interplay between these two is somehow able to range from the enchanting to the exquisitely painful ; but from beginning to end remains capable of leaving you breathless . one look into angelina jolie 's eyes and you will see the warm , jaundiced decay of a soul no longer battling with sanity . fear is born of those eyes when you realize how strongly they 've tempted your own tired efforts...even as the second look delves closer to a bleakness bearing fruition beyond existential suicide . presented with the softly rendered and absorbing visualization of a young girl 's decent into psychological insecurity ; it is a hauntingly supple progression toward the half understood disturbance of what we might have experienced . james mangold directed this film quite nicely from a very good screenplay ; he managed to portray all these young women as young women in turmoil . no melodrama , no over the top sentimentality , just a frank peek into their tumultuous lives . if you 've ever questioned your own sanity or escaped periods of exceptional melancholy in your life , this film is certain to trigger old fears . but it is also certain to remind you how exquisite and simple salvation can often be . this film deserves that second look , as well as its painful salvation : a jaundiced beauty whose tragic death is no less healing than the memory of a lost friend . it is a heavy drama , so be forewarned ! and a very moving drama at that .
music pos 122.txt i have seen al jarreau 20 times in concert ( and recently saw al and george perform at the hollywood bowl ) and am a long-time fan from way back . there are a few al cds that you just play forwards and backwards ( and back when they were cassettes , you wore out the tape ) because they 're just perfect . " breakin ' away " , " jarreau " and " heaven and earth " come to mind . well , add " givin ' it up " to that list . if you 're an old-school al fan and you 're wondering whether to buy this cd , buy it . it will live up to all of your al expectations . there 's a " look the rainbow " feel to it , there 's a " breakin ' away " feel to it , there 's a " jarreau " feel to it . there 's even a " glow " feel to it ( when you think about tunes like " milwaukee " and " have you seen the child ? " ) . grassroots al. it 's got the production values of " heaven and earth " and " tenderness " . fabulous production , arrangements , gathering of talent . there is not one song on here that you will skip as you 're listening to it driving to work or whatever . in fact , if you 're throwing a party and want to instantly get people in a jazzy party mood , put on this cd because between everybody from chris botti to jill scott to a soulful paul mccartney , people will stop and say , " wow , listen to jill and george tearing up ' god bless the child . ' " and " is that paul mccartney tearing up ' bring it on home to me ' ? " [yes , it is.] meanwhile , al and george are working their magic the entire time , and guests will say , " listen to george right there . " and , " al is jamming right now . " it 's a conversation-stopper provided by the best thing that can stop a conversation at a party : fabulous music that people must comment on . of course , that 's where the conversation picks right back up , so you win either way . the blend is perfect : just a touch of scatting , just a touch of voice-beat , with lots of fabulous jazzy vocals by both al and george , tons of great music solos , and george playing a perfect guitar . if you 're a george benson fan , you will be thrilled with this cd because george provides a fabulous through-line to every piece . he 's ever-present with every wonderful thing he ever did on a guitar . he fronts many of the pieces , and he 's not in any way relegated to " background guitarist . " he is the music in every piece , with few exceptions . as much as i love al , this cd is magical because of the blend of george and al. only these two can pair up to make this kind of cd . there is no other team who could have pulled this off . you need al 's voice and george 's guitar . period . in fact , i 'm guessing much of the jazz music world is a tad jealous right now of how simply genius this cd is , as in , " dang . these two are great together . wow . " bottom line : this is a perfect blend of these two greats ' talents . george takes care of the music , while al provides the wide gamut of vocals he 's an expert at ( and that only he can provide ) . if you 've been a long-time fan of either of these two , you wo n't be disappointed . it 's not lopsided . and it 's old-school in every good way . my prediction : this cd will sweep the grammys . if it does n't , there is no justice . like another reviewer on this page , i intend to buy this cd for about eight people . it 's just that perfect
health pos 335.txt this humidifier is easy to refil and not a big eye-sore even in small rooms . also , stays very clean not a lot of build up like other humidifiers . would give it 5 stars but you do have to refil it about every 8 hours . which i guess it 's good that it 's easy to refil . the price is also the reason for 4 stars instead of 5. i think it is a little pricey for not a lot of features compared to bigger ones with more features for the same price . perhaps you pay for the convient size . overall , i really do like this humidifer and is the only one i like to have in the house because of low maintence and small size .

dvd pos 204.txt attila was a 2001 mini series which won the honor of being the most watched mini-series of its day . it features a stellar cast including powers boothe as a crafty roman leader who tries to use attila to gain possession of rome . gerard butler is attila , the hun , and he is everything about attila in this role , never was an actor better suited . his character is sharp , passionate , determined and has an instant magnatism that keeps the viewer glued to the film . he brings a strong intensity and subtle gentleness to the character which makes watching him clash with boothe even more dynamic . this is a definite watch for anyone that likes period piece drama or just really well staged war scenes
music pos 189.txt in boyz ii men 's sophomore album , ii , they make attempts to create their own identities with writing and producing this time around escaping producer dallas austin and founder michael bivins . this lp begins with the deepest of gratitude on " thank you " produced by the group and dallas austin . both " all around the world " and " u know " are mid-tempo tracks with a hip-hop flavor to them , but neither of the two is strikingly memorable or highlights . one thing they do is provide another angle for boyz ii men . for a more relaxing environment , " vibin ' " has a rather simple instrumentation , lyrics and vocals . " i sit away " is a hidden gem with a mid-tempo flow with soothing lyrics written by tony rich and production by veteran l.a. reid and tony rich . stepping into a more modern jazz feel " jezzebel " strengthen the groups range and abilities as the album is nearing a completed overall goal . over a piano solo , boyz ii men harmonize on " khilil ( interlude ) " to shift the gears down to their overpowering abilities to formulate ballads that begins with " trying times " written and produced by wanya morris , tim kelley & bob robinson . hit maker babyface lends a hand on two of the thirteen track album with smash singles and highlights " i 'll make love to you " and " water runs dry " . heavyweights jimmy jam & terry lewis add a touch of love and mood setting material on " on bended knee " . " 50 candles " drives this album to epic proportions with its thriving bass and lyrical content " ...feels like one of those nights.. . " they show and prove why for their time there are no other male groups that can compare to their beautiful harmony and range as on " yesterday " they perform accapella . if real talent that you seek , members shawn , michael , nathan and wanya has uncompromising talent for any age , era , or time that you can enjoy for long time .
dvd neg 572.txt this could have been an excellent documentary , but the makers of it decided to distort history rather than present it honestly . this is particularly true in the way it depicts sparta as being some kind of womyn 's power state which is absurd . somewhat comically , the narrator enhances the story of sparta by telling the story of its women which is quite trendy and also totally bogus . she tells us of laconic girls and their supposeed bi-sexuality . hughes states that it would be a mistake to think of it as a " feminist wonderland , " but that 's exactly what is implied . i do n't know how these other reviewers missed all the laughable politicizing such as : " fighting wars is a soft option compared to going home to mother . " yeah right ! unless of course , husbands who shave their wives heads and leave after inseminating them count as amounting to the progressive ideal . pretending people of the past had the sensibilities we do is disgraceful . to many counter-culturalists , history has no value if it is not used for the purposes of advancing a political program . unfortunately , that is precisely what we have here in this spoiled work . as for bettany hughes , i agree that she is quite attractive , but she is an awful narrator as she at times is downright giddy . hers is not the type of personality that should be discussing sparta- -i 'll take victor davis hanson any day over her . i recommend that you skip this one and look for something which quotes actual historians .

music pos 100.txt if you were lucky enough to buy the soundtrack when first released in 1987 on enigma records , hang on to that out of print gem ! straight to hell is back on cd as straight to hell returns , and may have a lot more tracks this time , but it also deleted two tracks from the original release and shortens another track . not appearing this time are : " the good , the bad and the ugly " by the pogues , and my personal favorite " money , guns and coffee " by pray for rain . the track " the killers " by pray for rain ran 2 minutes 55 seconds on the original , but on this new release was shortened to only 2 minutes . this is rather perplexing considering straight to hell returns runs a total of 55 minutes 7 seconds , which would have left room for those other tracks to be included ( since cds can run a total of 79 minutes 59 seconds ) . i 'm deducting a point from my rating of this cd because the missing tracks should have been included ! on the plus side , this new release contains a lot of short instrumental tracks from the film that were not on the original cd release in 1987 , as well as some brief dialogue excerpts . the film was a misunderstood classic , and the soundtrack of spaghetti western-style rock is wonderful : the pogues , joe strummer , pray for rain , zander schloss , elvis costello 's macmanus gang , and even dialogue excerpts from courtney love before she was , well , i guess the word is " famous . " if you 're a fan of any of these artists , you 'll love this assortment of songs...those not familiar with the film may not be able to absorb the atmosphere these songs and instrumentals create , so get the film on dvd and you 'll appreciate the works of these artists so much more . the liner notes claim this cd is to be considered the " official " soundtrack , while the first release of it back in 1987 was basically a " souvenir . " i enjoy both releases immensely , but since i was listening to those other deleted tracks for nearly 20 years now , it 's sad to not hear them this time around

dvd pos 244.txt bob clark 's 1974 chiller classic , which went on to inspire many elements of " halloween " and " when a stranger calls " , is definitely one of the better , if not best , horror films out there . period . not high on blood , but very high on suspense , dread , atmosphere , and out-of-the-dark surprises . a sorority house ( to include the lovely olivia hussey , the vulgar alcoholic margot kidder , and sctv vet andrea martin ) falls victim to vicious , violent , and altogether menacing phone calls during the christmas holidays . soon , students on campus begin turning up missing . though some events do go unexplained ( which could be positive , considering the mystery involved ) and the film tends to go borderline predictable in some sorts , this is undeniably one of the creepiest horror films , with the most tense , moody photography ever captured on film . keir dullea and margot kidder turn in quite effective performances . highly recommended

health neg 404.txt i was happy to see this type of product available , but was not happy when i received it . it seems like a flimsy piece of plastic , and the " magnets " looked like they were painted on , a gold-tone , and the paint looked like it was chipping off . the base of the item is separate from the top of the item , which seems to be attached with springs ? it did run , but was very loud , like it was working too hard . there is a note not to use it more than 20 minutes , which i 'm not sure is because of a potential adverse affect with the user , or because the unit might overheat . there were some spelling errors on the outside of the box ( a few places said " reflexology " and a few places said " relexology " ) - - but maybe that just bothers me ? i think it is also important to note that the buyer pays shipping , and if returned - - also pays return shipping charges ; and when combined , nearly equals the original cost of the item . ; o (

software neg 342.txt i purchased quickbooks 2005 ; 4th upgrade in 10 years . unlike earlier versions , this one is confusing and painful to use . simple things like making deposits has to do through contraptions . one of the reasons i upraded was to use online banking ; it 's a complete disaster . it does n't download the complete trasaction details , reconcilliations are very difficult . you will be doing twice the work to use it . once my transfer to the bank was aborted by a message saying you are low on memory and though quickbooks sent the transaction to the bank , it did n't mark it internally , so on the next login , it sent the payment again ! ! ! it has cost me $1509 of double payment that i am still trying to get back ! how you pay a bill is totally messed up , there is no way for you to mark that a bill was paid online unless it was done through quickbooks online connection . ( bank 's billpay ca n't be used ! ! ) it 's very poor in organization , you ca n't have 2 accounts # 's with a vendor ( still in 2005 ! ! ! ) . it has introduced obscure concepts as items and classes , which have no real definition and no " default " use and stop every transaction . one of the biggest thing quickbooks has done to hurt their customers is the payroll . technically you can do it yourself , but they hide that information and scare you in every step that you should ( must ) buy the $299 / year payroll service ( old tax-tables ) . in all the documenation , not once do they mention that you can do the payroll directly and this is how . compared to the earlier products , this is a huge cost . by that reckoning i would have paid ~$2000 for the previous version of quickbooks ! ! it 's definitely cheaper to buy a basic version of the software and use an accountant to do the other work and you will be better off . do n't waste money on quicken services or premium products , they will bleed you to death on your way to a mental asylum

software pos 630.txt love the program... . hate the company ! i 've been using quickbooks for more than 10 years . i started with the basic edition since i am a very small business and use only a portion of the program , specifically customer and vendor lists , invoicing , a / r and purchase orders . overkill is an understatement.. . quickbooks pro is much more powerful than i need . i do n't use payroll , check printing , year end accounting and many of its other functions . so why did i purchase such a powerful program ? that 's the " rub " . intuit is not satisfied with its quickbooks users being content with the edition that they are using ; intuit sales people call all too frequently trying to get you to upgrade to the next higher version ( edition ) of their program . they hounded me for years to upgrade from the early basic edition to the then current basic edition ; finally , they dropped support of the product and i had no choice . i purchased quickbooks 2005 basic edition in 2005. shortly after purchasing it , they informed me that they were no longer going to support the 2005 basic edition and if i wanted continued support i would have to upgrade again , this time to the pro edition . this january ( 2007 ) i received an email from intuit informing me that my 2005 basic edition would n't run on the new windows xp vista platform and if i switched to vista i would need to upgrade to quickbooks pro . i upgraded to a new pc in february as the result of a major crash on my former system and opted to go with vista , thinking that i could install windows 98 as a second operating system to run quickbooks 2005 basic . the second operating system did n't work out and , after seriously considering switching to microsoft accounting 2007 , i purchased quickbooks pro . i was very disappointed that intuit did n't offer a significant purchase incentive to existing users ; but they never have in all the years that i 've been using their product . even microsoft , the shark of sharks , offers incentives . do n't be misheartened . i purchased the program from amazon and , with rebates and other purchase incentives , saved $60 over intuit 's price ; i could have saved an additional $25 if i had bought on ebay ( had i known it at the time ) .

music pos 154.txt ah , yes , it 's nirvana 's " nevermind " cd , released in 1991. i listen to all 80 's pop-metal , or hair metal ( whitesnake , winger , van halen , y&t , dokken ) i could go on forever on 80 's bands . ( of course there is rick springfield , and john cougar mellencamp ) . i am a true rocker here , i know all the true bands out there , i know everything about them . i have reasons for this . but here 's the bottom line . nirvana was a breakthough along with soundgarden and pearl jam back in the early 90's . millions of people bought those cds . and yes , there were hair bands still alive back then , like poison , and firehouse , etc. firehouse and poison had alot of success , eventhough it was n't the 80 's anymore . as i can see , alot of my fellow rockers do n't really like nirvana , or pearl jam , or soundgarden . to be completely honest , i like their music , i just do n't prefer the music , because i do n't like the hard sound . i really like the glam-hair band style . people say : " nirvana and those other grunge bands killed glam-metal " . yes , i agree that they killed the 80 's hair bands , but it 's not necessarly their fault . it 's a mix between the bands , and the people listenting to the music . because of grundge music , today 's music is quite horrifying , with emo and other types of music that would 've been a nightmare back in those days . nirvana has a great cd here , but i just do n't prefer it . if you are a real rocker , you 'll listen to all the types of music back then . do n't judge unless you have actually heard it , because you may actually like it . to all rockers - do n't listen to modern music . it 's poisoning our people , and no one really understands the true meaning of " the guitar " in today 's music . most of you will understand what i mean , so listen to the classics . classic rock , and hair bands forever , and even grunge . keep the classic alive . ~the sicilian axe ma
dvd neg 156.txt saw this on the box last night . i sat through the whole thing just to see if it would improve - it didn't . i kept wondering whether this was a radio play that someone had decided to film . the dialogue is wooden , the plot is pathetic , the whole set-up is unconvincing . it looks like something the actors did in a couple of days due to contractual obligations of some sort or maybe to cash in on the whole & quot ; vegas&quot ; craze - which ranges from csi to & quot ; the cooler&quot ; .

books neg 356.txt this book is for readers with little or no knowledge of recent debates on energy security , global warming , etc. as well as related technological advances in fields such as hydrogen and fuel cells . the author contributes little to previous books on the subject , such as rikin 's book on hydrogen which is much better researched and just as accesible to the general public . if anything , the book 's original contribution is to discuss how energy and environmental issues can be addressed using market mechanisms . in doing so , the author comes up with some interesting case studies , but it 's quite obvious he is biased toward the same tired free-market ideology that is endlessly promoted in the pages of the economist , which happens to be the author 's employer . moreover , there was little effort in integrating the various chapters . overall , a very disapointing book . the author should stick to journalism

books pos 349.txt did you ever know someone whose life was just " perfect " ? ? someone who went to college , got married at age 23 , found a great job with valuable stock options.. . someone who settled down in a house in a nice city at age 25 or 26 , started a family a year or two later , and who now seems to " have it all " ? ? well , after world war ii , this happened to just about everyone in the silent generation , and it happen to most in the boomer generation , and it 's happening to just about no one in generation x . this books speaks to members of generation x and describes the suffering and coping mechanisms for these people . this book , now 15 years , is about a generation that was sold down the river by its elders - generation x . the book describes 3 young people , andy , dag , and claire , who visit palm springs and tell stories of their lives and of their friends who are suffering in life . the author douglas coupland is actually telling stories from vancouver british columbia , one of the first cities in north america to be sold out to foreign economic colonizers from hong kong ( who escaped to vancouver to avoid the 1997 mainland takeover . ) in this city , the worst 1100 square foot fixer-upper house costs a third of a million dollars , or 10 years of take-home pay for a mid-career household . economic success is impossible in the physical confines of the city - the system is rigged against everyone except rich immigrants and the existing upper class of blue-collar boomers who purchased homes in the 1970 's and 1980's . many aspects of the book ( such as " reverse sabbatical " , " mcjobs " , etc. ) reflect the severe economic conditions faced by high-achieving intellectuals who go nowhere economically in that city . in my grandparents generation , all you had to do was to go to college . in my parent 's generation , you needed to go to college and become a successful professional . in my own generation , you need to co-found a startup company and be among the 10% of founders who can sell off the company or have an ipo . do you notice something here ? yes , it 's getting more and more difficult to be marginally successful in america . because gen x'ers find that traditional paths to success - hard work , taking chances , saving and investing - do n't work any more , they resolve to live like their parents by either living with their parents or by borrowing money endlessly and hoping for a miracle . fiscal irresponsibility is at an all-time high , and has squandered everyone 's future ! in this environment of perpetual economic slavery , coupland counsels generation x'ers to break free of the traditional career models that have been rigged by their elders for failure . coupland counsels us all to re-examine what is success in our life and how to achieve it . this book is a call to enlist in a class warfare between gen-x'ers and their elders ! in many ways , this book is similar to " the razor 's edge " by w . somerset maughen or " the monk and the riddle : the art of creating a life while making a living " , in other words , redefine your notion of success in the world , while waiting for our evil society to implode in upon itself , which must surely happen in the near future ..

music neg 491.txt i purchased this disk along with others to play in my acura dvd-a system . i found the overall audio quality to be a bit disappointing...and the mix to be a bit " over the top " with surround effects . major vocals coming from rear speakers , etc. i also found the overall sound to lack the brightness and crispness on this specific disk . in fact , the demo disk for my tl has the marvin gaye song " let 's get it on " and it is remarkably brighter on that disk than on this collection . if you are looking for dvd-a disks with 5.1 surround...i 'd pass on this one and maybe purchase the cd of this album .

dvd neg 32.txt the most simple definition of [...] is sexual gratuitousness . sexual imaging for the sake of turning people on , not providing anything pertinent to the plot . you ca n't help but get a porno feel while watching bully . and to think i was supposed to be viewing a film about teenage revenge on the local bully ; but it turns out to be a soft porn version of how vapid teenagers waste away their lives with a little killing thrown in . was it really necessary to show a shot of a girl 's crotch while she 's driving a car ? was it necessary to have a sex scene or nudity scene or drug scene every 3 minutes ? you ca n't help but see the director as a pervert who is more preoccupied with sex and street cred grittiness than telling a good story . the very first scene is of a guy having phone sex . several things about this movie other than the [...] made me mad : 1. you 're planning to kill somebody , then proceed to tell everybody , including the waitress at pizza hut what you 're planning . 2. after you kill , you 're so afraid of being caught that you proceed to put more suspicion on yourself by acting very strange and telling even more people what you did . 3. which makes more sense ? to decide to kill a guy because he disrespects you and beats you up occasionally and has sex with your girlfriend , or , to stop hanging out with him completely and stop lending your girlfriend out like a wh-ore . bobby never put a gun to the guy 's head to make him hang out with him , yet murder was the only option ? 4. i ca n't believe mr. wimp who never fights back can all of a sudden muster the strength to slit a guy 's throat while he 's staring him blankly in the face begging for his life . 5. all of the characters
music pos 334.txt this album is a great representation of what spoon is about . great music along with fantasticly written lyrics provide a feeling of sheer uphoria to one 's ears . spoons sound is somewhat like cake but different in ways as well . they are a very good band that should be getting more cred than what they are getting . some of my faves on this cd include mathematical mind , the two sides of monsieur valentine , sister jack and i turn my camera on . i would strongly recommend this cd to anyone that like alternative rock . definately money well spent
software pos 80.txt i 'm not a spider-man fan . i love powers , the ultimates , supreme power , planetary and other stuff by warren ellis , brian michael bendis , et.al . so when i bought this , i wondered if spending a whopping $49 would be worth it . i wanted to read straczynski 's recent run of spider-man , but if i was going to spend about $20 on a graphic novel , why not spend a little more for the whole thing . and that 's just what you get . in addition to getting straczynski 's 4-year run ( which includes spider-man 's evolution and discovery of his totemic powers ) , you get everything leading up to june 2006 ( which is just like 3 issues ago ! ) . and all on 1 dvd-rom . true , the cons are that when it comes to crossovers , you only get the amazing spider-man stories and reading it off your computer is n't as fun as reading the actual comics - - but that does n't compare to getting the entire run . it 's like complaining about getting a free ps3 , xbox360 and nintendo wii , because the box did n't come with it or you 're missing one controller . $50 may seem steep , but if comics cost $3 now , so for the price of like one or two months worth of comics - - or for 2 books , you get everything . and it 's true , you can just print out the pages if you want ( so if you want to abuse your office or school 's printer , go for it !

music pos 194.txt well it 's not quite as good as rising which is the best album ever but it 's still amazing . 1.man on the silver mountain - 10 / 10 this track is a classic and is still played at every dio concert and ritchie blackmore still performed it at every rainbow concert until rainbow disbanded in 1997 but anyway this may be ritchie blackmore 's strongest riff ever ! and dio 's vocal performance is excellent . anyway it 's a great fantasy song by dio and blackmore and still got radio play so it appeals to everyone . 2.self portrait - 10 / 10 excellent dark song by the band which fits dio 's voice perfectly another classic ! 3.black sheep of the family - 8 / 10 good song but not a rainbow song it 's a cover and that 's a shame because i would have loved to hear dio 's brilliant lyrics another original song but anyway still a good listen 4.catch the rainbow - 10 / 10 another classic from this album as dio shows how well he can sing ballads as well as epics and rockers . blackmore has a solo full of feeling and this was performed at every rainbow concert until dio left the band . 5.snake charmer - 10 / 10 another song that takes place in the middle ages which is rainbow 's trademark . anyway this song is very underrated and should have been a classic . dio has brilliant lyrics and vocals as usual and it 's no suprise that blackmore supplied excellent solos and riffs for this one 6.temple of the king - 10 / 10 here is the best ballad of all time ! ! ! ronnie 's vocals are perfect for this song and his lyrics are amazing too . blackmore throws togethor and a great arrangemant and solo aswell to make this maybe the best track on the album . 7.if you do n't like rock n roll - 8 / 10 kind of cheesy lyrics but a good track and it sounds more like an elf track . 8.sixteenth century greensleeves - 10 / 10 great song ! a real classic as dio puts togethor another great fantasy song . blackmore 's riffs is brilliant and his solo is full of bends and shredding . 9.still i 'm sad - 10 / 10 well the version with vocals is much than this instrumental version but this version is brilliant too . the live version off on stage however with dio 's vocals blow it away . i still wonder why there were n't any vocals on this . the band is ronnie james dio - vocals ritchie blackmore - guitar gary driscoll - drums mickey lee soule - keyboards , piano , mellatron craig guber - bass 2

music pos 244.txt to be honest i ca n't think of a word that can explain the emotional link with this album apart from it being the most beautiful sound i 've heard . for me listening to this album makes me feel emotionally confused but absolutely complete at the same time , never before has an album stopped me in my tracks as firmly as this one . my favourite songs on the album are " the only moment we were alone " and " six days at the bottom of the ocean " every time my ears are blessed with these artworks i 'm am fixated on nothing else but them . i literally cannot communicate with anyone or anything i just have to listen to them intently . this album is not as experimental as " those who tell the truth shall die those who tell the truth shall live forever " but i feel it is just as good and the songs are put together impeccably well , with no song being neither longer nor shorter than it has to be . i love the pure , clean sound of this album and see it as light as the wind . the trance that this album provides is indescribable ; i 'm not saying if you buy this album it will have this exact effect on you this description is merely from a personal note . either way i strongly recommend this band and album to anybody who is looking for a purchase , for you can have no doubt that this album is extremely well produced , written , recorded , thought out and sounding . buy it , you will not regret your choice one bit .

dvd neg 496.txt men of a certain age will remember how , when we were kids and this was played on tv in the early 80s , we thought it was so cool when a huge army of police officers fired so many shots into a house that it eventually collapsed , and when a bus was shot full of holes by an even larger army of cops . but those two over-the-top scenes are all this movie has going for it . the other action scenes are pretty silly and unbelievable , especially scenes involving a sniper in a helicopter , and atop a parking structure , both of whom were in " ca n't miss " positions and missed anyway . moreover , if you know anything about law the plot is beyond silly . it involves eastwood being sent from phoenix to las vegas to escort a witness being extradited back to arizona for a trial . the witness will testify about bad behavior on the part of the phoenix police commissioner , and a corrupt assistant district attorney is involved with the commissioner in a coverup . assuming a material witness can be extradited , which i doubt , the crime appears to have been committed in vegas , so it would tried in vegas , not phoenix . and if the ada prosecuting the case was corrupt and wanted to cover for the commissioner , he could just dismiss the case , and there would be no need to murder the witness . the idea that they would want to draw attention to the case by having 200 cops line up and try to assassinate the witness is beyond ridiculous . in sum , the plot and the action were both absurd , and the only interesting scenes were the crazy firepower overkill at the house and on the bus . but those two scenes probably ca n't carry the entire movie for the average viewer .

dvd pos 815.txt i previously wrote a review for this and only gave it 3 stars . but after watching it again , i realized i liked it better ( i do agree with the reviewer below me in that it does grow on you ) . i do not consider all of the performances goth . martiya possesion are more tribal than anything ( at least on this video ) and i really dislike the expression , or lack thereof , on their faces while they are dancing . they either look completely bored , pissed off , or smug . i skip right over it . i also did not care for asharah 's dance to the drum solo by solace ( " opaque " ) . the dance mood does not match the mood of the music at all . the music is saying " fast , big , upbeat " and she 's standing there doing taxim moves and small quick moves . and of course , we all love the s&m piece...excuse me , s&m is not part of the goth subculture , and has no place on a bellydance video . jehan may be a great and accomplished dancer , but she did n't dance much on this and i did n't want to see what was on her part . another thing i would have liked to see is more goth music . i like solace and all , but there were a lot of songs by them on this video and it would have been nice to see some more pieces done to music from the goth genre . there were a few , but not enough for my liking . my favorites on this video were tempest , ariellah , jeniviva and ayshe ( for wierdness factor ) . for all of its faults , this is a good video to be inspired by and i will use it for that purpose

music pos 757.txt this album was released in the summer of ' 86 when queen 's radio airplay was at a rather low point in the u.s. and at a very high point in europe.by now , the band had adventured into pop genres beyond rock , yet colouring their songs with their distinctive style of interpretation and playing.here we find the gorgeous ballad one year of love and the catchy friends will be friends.the ominous anthem who wants to live forever and the highlander themed princes of the universe are gems in this crown.the first two usa singles , the rocker one vision ( from iron eagle ) and the danceable a kind of magic barely cracked the us top 40 in a decade when alternative music was preferred and classics were often overlooke

dvd neg 359.txt this movie was quite honestly one of the worst movies i have ever seen . as a huge colin firth fan originally from a small town in vermont , i thought that no matter what i had heard about the film i would enjoy it . unfortunately , i was wrong . the main problem of the film was characterization . there were oftentimes no motivations or explanations whatsoever for the character 's actions . one minute , the small town girl played by heather graham is working at a nursing home , then she 's downing alcohol , then she 's jumping around naked for absolutely no apparent reason ( in fact , she does n't even seem drunk ) , and all this entices the character colin firth to jump into bed with her . i think the heather graham character is supposed to be quirky , but because of the script and the way the film is cut , she comes off as schitsophrenic and unlikable . then suddenly they are in a serious relationship which colin dives into wholeheartedly even though he is supposed to be recovering from a breakup with his fiance ( and this is no rebound relationship ) . basically , the movie continues along this vein , with minnie driver showing up as the dark-haired british ex-fiance who you ca n't see ever having had a relationship with colin ( both actors are better in the much superior movie circle of friends ) . in any case , there are many more unexplained actions and wierd breakups / get back togethers before the movie thankfully ends . additionally , the setting is completely misused , beginning with the sign that says more than 18 , 000 people live in hope . in new england , that does not classify as a small town . they could have used the autumn setting and american-ness of the people as restorative to the colin character . the suggestion of that is there , but it is never demonstrated - instead , they go to a spot that is supposed to be nice and the heather graham character downs a bottle of booze , and colin firth 's character has no real explanation or feeling in his portraits of the town 's people . although the hotel owners are fun , if unrealistic , the mayor has been written as if he were a cartoon character . finally , i do n't neccessarily blame the actors for this awful movie , with the wierd cutting , it may have seemed like a good idea at the time . i think colin firth does his best at being an ambigious , but still likeable guy . heather graham , aside from not coming off as a small town girl at all , has absolutely nothing to work with , so you ca n't even blame her for the horrendous character she has . and everyone else , including minnie driver , is a complete caricature , although minnie driver incites some of the few amusing moments in the film . i feel bad to judge this movie so harshly , but it is unneccessarily bad , and i had been hoping for something at least fun . these actors all have much better movies out there .

books pos 149.txt one of the things i like about this book for young readers is that the same vocabulary words are repeated throughout the series so that the kids can build on what they learned in one book while they 're reading the next . at first , i was disappointed with the series since i did n't think it did justice to the little house series that i treasured myself as a girl . after a few reads , however , i see that the magic of laura ingalls wilder 's stories shines through in this series with renee graef 's illustrations . how else do you explain to a four-year-old what a log cabin is really like ? i am surprised how many " how. .

camera pos 581.txt this is my first digital camera . prior to this i had a simple kodak point-and-click model which pretty much the quality of a disposible . i use much higher grade cameras at work both 35mm and digital . this camera gives you the 5.1 mp ability though most shots only require the 3mp . i like the 32mb internal memory though i 've also bought a 256mb card for traveling . the 5x zoom is n't as cool as i initially thought it would be and digital zoom works sometimes and not others but you must understand what digital zoom really is . the camera takes very clear and optimal pictures . better pictures then i 've taken on anything else i 've owned before ( and some of the work cameras as well ) . the size is small enough to put in your pocket but not too small for one with larger hands . the different flash options and shooting scenes can turn difficult pictures into what you want to capture . the panoramic shot sequence is an especially favorite feature especially for shoreline shots . i 've also bought the r-series dock and enjoy its ability to transfer my pictures faster and charge two batteries at once . this camera is worth the price you pay but i believe its a 2005 model so it may not be the most up to date but it does a great job .

music pos 578.txt this album is essentially a fusion of great musical minds . the legendary khan payes more attention to making this a better experience for the western audiences of the sufi music by playing more with his ( brilliant ) vocal skills then with the lyrics . micheal brooks ' music stands out and enhances the experience further . this is not to say that the mainstream indo-paki audience wo n't enjoy this album ( this is one of my all time favs ) . it is fabulous background listening while doing work which may need focus - for those who need music to do such things.. . : ) for those who have been thinking of testing out sufi music , this is the place to start . this is a fine introduction to the great nfak and sufi music .
books neg 456.txt am i the only one who did n't get a complete book ? at first i noticed there was some poor editing - lots of typos . but then after page 180 , where page 181 should be ( sleep chapter ) , it goes back to page 117 ( discipline chapter that i already read ) . it continues to repeat pages 117 to 180 ( a whole 63 pages duplicated ! ) , then picks up again on page 245 in the middle of the school days chapter that i do n't have the beginning of . i 'm completely missing pages 181-245 ( 67 pages ) . other than that , good for a few laughs and a handful of ideas
software neg 635.txt this program is terrible to deal with . i run a small business and bought quickbooks simple start . once loaded and you go to use the program there is a pop up requiring you have an administrator . when loading the software it does not tell you to select or bypass the administrator requirement . you only learn this when you first go to use the program . the url they give on the pop up for troubleshooting does not address this issue , either . you are just locked out of the program . now it gets fun . so , you have to speak to them for help . but this is where it gets to be no laughing matter . to get help you have to email them to ask for help . they then call you back at their convenience . if you are busy working when they call back you have to start all over . i have yet to be able to use this product since i bought it 3 weeks ago because they will not call back when it is convenient for me the customer and will not let me call in at my covenience . even worse , since they have bought out all their competitors quickbooks customer support no longer is available after regular hours when a small business owner has the time to handle such operations issues . i ca n't return this product for a refund because i have loaded it . my first clue to how not user friendly this product is should have been the title : simple start
camera neg 582.txt instead of this pick up a plextor convertor box . it takes the output of the camcorder ( composite / rca or s-video ) and compresses that to mpeg-2 ( dvd ) or mpeg-4 ( or divx ) and includes software which easily burns that to dvd or cd ( mpeg-1 or mini dvd ) . look for plextor 's m402u box . unless you really want to deal with 3.125 mb of data per second ( 25 mbps ) , or about 180 mb per minute , or about 11 gb per hour through the firewire link , get the m402u . your options will be greatly expanded , and you wo n't tell the difference by looking
software neg 358.txt i purchased the standard edition of x3 primarily for 3 reasons : 1 ) it claims to have the ability to convert pdf files into wp format , 2 ) it claims to be able to organize your e-mail files through the use of wp mail well beyond the capabilities of outlook express , and 3 ) it claims enhanced use of wp for word processing . what i found was a product that met only one out of three of its claims . in baseball , batting .333 will put you into the hall of fame . in business , fulfilling one of three claims will put you into bankruptcy ! while the pdf converter is a rather good tool , wp3 mail is unstable ( and this is from their tech support department ) . it destabilizes your use of e-mail to the point of making it virtually unusable in terms of reliability . i imported older e-mail from outlook express when i installed the wp x3 software , only to later find out that the system crashed regularly . i could not get at my older imported e-mail , and could not find a practical way to reverse the importing back into outlook express . what really irked me was that their tech support was worthless in rectifying the situation . they merely responded by saying they were aware of the problem and " may " release a patch to help sometime in the future . ahhhhh ! as to the alleged improved " word processing power " , i have experienced more bugs then appear in an animal planet channel special on insects in the amazon jungle . unwanted page formating changes occur when i click my mouse on the page i had just finish reformatting . undesired line spacing would appear on pages . the list goes on , but who has the time to be more detailed . do yourself a favor and avoid the product . if you need to upgrade , check out the latest version of ms word , you will be far more satisfied i 'm sure
books neg 671.txt talk about taking the joy out of an experience . i read this book prior to a week-long trip to venice . this book quite simply accomplished none of its objectives . it is a poor & quot ; guidebook&quot ; and is poorly written and uninteresting in terms of a travelogue . the history and art of venice are covered better in books from those genres . the only upside is that it is short . yuck , what a waste of time . my advice is : get a novel about venice if you like novels , a guidebook if you want that , an art book , or a history book . at least you 'll get something out of those- -this one tries all of these and fails . actually , in terms of a travelogue , & quot ; vendela in venice&quot ; far surpassess any other venice book i have seen . although i originally bought it because it is considered a children 's book , it is not dumbed down at all and adults will enjoy it.. .
music neg 586.txt if this had been the first album in the " hip-hop hits " series , it would not be a promising start . there are a few decent tunes on here , but as someone who admired the quality of the earlier source albums , i must express an intense dislike for " hip hop hits vol.8 " . there used to be a time when the source gathered the biggest and best tracks from the rap indusrty for their compilations , now benzino has turned the series into a shameless promotion for his own favorites ( how else do you explain ja rule being here ? ) . here is a song-by-song analysis of this disaster : ( 1 ) youngbloodz feat . lil jon " damn " c- . this song is perfect example of why people are getting bored with " sothern crunk " . it 's lame and boring , as it shows lil jon becoming a one-trick pony . not a good song to open an album with . ( 2 ) wyclef " the industry " b . wyclef is very talented , but this song was never a hit . it should be heard for its quality though , even if it only touchs topics breifly . it is clear that wyclef is above most of his peers in everyway ; sorta like 2pac . ( 3 ) chingy " right thurr " b+. not my favorite rap song , its better than average though , it kinda grows on you . he reminds me of juvenile . it 's content is not original , but chingy makes it his own with a relaxed flow and style . ( 4 ) young gunz " ca n't stop , wo n't stop " c . if this standard work is what roca-a-fella has in it 's post-jay-z future , the label is going to be in real trouble . they 're good , but they have to be better than good to stand on their own . ( 5 ) westside connection feat . nate dogg " gangsta nation " b+. it was nice to see westside together again . the style and talent cover up for the somewhat standard material . at the bare minimum , the song is stylistic and very enjoyable . ( 6 ) ja-rule " clap back " d . this anti-eminem dis is just border line pathetic and lame . any eminem song is a bigger hit and better than ja rule 's weak new stuff . if ja rule wants to return to his position " pain is love " brought him to , he must work much harder . ( 7 ) kanye west " through the wire " c . kanye west has enjoyed chart success through alot of hype , but i find this song to be very pedestrian for rap . the lyrics do n't define kanye as an original rapper , and the use chaka kahn 's " through the fire " does n't make a very appealing beat . ( 8 ) gang starr " skills " c . the group is n't that good to begin with , and this song has none of the fun that " militia " had . gang starr has a decent , hardcore sound that needs to be refined in order to define themselves . ( 9 ) j-kwon " tipsy " b- .this song is fun to listen to , but that still does not make it any better than average . it 's not really about anything and gets kinda tiresome towards the end ; you may be looking at your watch . he 's too overpraised . ( 10 ) e-40 feat . clipse " quarterbackin " c+. the track is enjoyable but was never that popular and is pretty forgetable . e-40 and clipse just are n't that talented . it almost feels as if it was made strictly for the " madden football " video games " . ( 11 ) fabolous feat . tamia " into you " a . just great , hip hop with style and substance . it 's so nice to hear a gentler , more positive hip-hop songs ; one that does n't hammer the listener , but brings out emotions lightly . he is one of the best rappers of 2003 ; with both his album and it 's singles . ( 12 ) t.i. " be easy " c- . he has been compared to jay-z and nelly ; despite the difference that he lacks the talent those artists have . plain , boring , generic rap from an artist who ofers nothing new to the game ; no more needs to be said . one must also wonder why this was chosen over his bigger ( not exactly better though ) hits " rubber band man " and " let 's get away " . ( 13 ) cassidy feat . r . kelly " hotel " b- . a sorta fun track , r . kelly does as much as possible , but he even he ca n't make cassidy sound original . to be honest , this was a huge top 10 hit though ; so it kinda does belong here . ( 14 ) ying yang twins feat . lil ' jon & the east side boyz " salt shaker " b+. surprisingly , the beat and production make this song rather entertaining . it 's much more fun than it has the right to be ; given the non-spectacular artists involved . ( 15 ) scarface " recognize " c- . scarface used to be an exceptional rapper , but now he 's trying to regain glory that is no longer his . why listen to this , when you could just buy his older albums ? ( 16 ) the untouchables featuring benzino " relationship with me & my gun " c- .just a standard benzino track tacked on for shameless self-promotion . i would n't mind so much if the songt had actually been worth listening to . atleast " bang ta dis " on " vol.5 " was a good song . bottom line : *1 / 2. benzino has ruined the once great source series in the blink of an eye . if you want to hear a great source album , buy " hip hop hits vol.4 " ; a source album with the biggest and best raps of 2000. a few good tracks are not enough to balance out all the mediocre ones . to put it in short terms : with so many good compilations out there , why spend money on a bad one ? i would not buy this album with a gift card .

dvd neg 348.txt patton oswalt is funny and my two stars is not because of his performance . it 's because of comedy central mangling the dvd version . the show was originally broadcast on comedy central , and as such it was cut down to about 40 minutes so it could fill a one-hour time slot with commercials . the dvd has the original show , and then in the bonus section , it has " deleted scenes , " which are the parts of the full-length concert that were cut for time . so , you can watch the time-edited show , or you can watch the out-of-context segments that were taken out . but what you ca n't do , and what i have to think any chimpanzee able to use sign language would know you would want to do , is see the original full-length show in its entirety . so , cheers for patton , boos for cc . i wo n't be buying the dvd and that 's why .

books pos 550.txt we have used this book as a text for discrete math courses in our undergraduate computing engineering and systems program ( university of los andes , colombia ) . there are a lot of advantages using this approach instead of the classical one ( e.g. , people really learn to prove and learn to write correct proofs ) . however , to grasp these ideas you have to be patient and open minded . when other reviewers give 1 star to the book it is clear for me that perhaps they were expecting something magical that did not occur . this presentation of logic and its applications to informatics provides an excellent way to learn and really use the knowledge in the praxis . in chapter 8 you go seamlessly from propositional to higher order logic . sums and logical quantifications are , for example , treated in an uniform way . maybe the type concept is not so fine explained , but one has to remember that this is an introductory book . 5 stars , of course
software neg 124.txt i trusted that this software would do what it claimed to do and was so let down by its lack of performance that i am dumbfounded and left speechless . during backup process i selected about 15gb of info to backup , spanning 4 dvds . everything looked fine , except for two ( 2 ) simple errors that i received , indicating that those related files may not have been copied / backed up properly . i figured no big deal , 2 files / errors out 15gb , i could handle that . based upon the false pretenses that my critical info was backed up properly ( simple pictures , videos , mp3 files and financial files to include previous years tax files ) , i then proceeded to slick my drive . remember , only 2 simple , benign and almost inconspicuous errors during the backup process . everything looked great . during the restore process , i then received numerous errors , each of them requiring me to click ' yes ' when asked if i wanted to proceed . i got tired of clicking yes around the 100 or so mark and decided to click no . when you click ' no ' , everything is undone ; there is no ' ignore all ' function so i had to sit through every prompt and got tired of it and decided that proceeding with 1000 files and answering yes would involve too much pain for me . i then selected a smaller group of files to have restored , only the ' my documents ' folder but ran into the same situation . eventually i ran a test on a small folder to have restored and still ran into the errors but pressed through . hardly any of the files were received error free and those that had issues were never restored . my guess is approximately 2 / 3 or 3 / 4 of my files were not restored and of course none that really mattered made it . i had the latest update applied to the program , so that should not be the cause . i would have done better to slick my entire hard drive without going through the backup process as i would have been at nearly the same place but without experiencing all the headaches , frustrations and an investment of hours , no days of my time . the program has been recently purchased by microsoft for inclusion in the vista os , i imagine . it will do well as a microsoft product , as it fails to deliver upon its promises

books pos 310.txt this is one of the best business books i 've ever read . mr. nocera says it took him six years to write this book , and i believe it . the amount of work that went into this book is obvious . this is an excellent piece of business journalism . the annotations and bibliography are thorough , and the overall writing and editing is top notch . mr. nocera covers a rich array of elements important to the development of the financial services industry over the last half of the 20th century : - automated teller machines ( atms ) - the bankamericard ( later visa ) - outdated banking regulations - black monday , october 19 , 1987 - jimmy carter 's futile attempts to wrestle runaway inflation in the late 1970 's - cash management accounts ( cmas ) - citibank ( later citicorp ) - deregulation of brokers ' commissions - growth of american consumer debt as a result of runaway inflation in the late 1970 's - america 's cultural adoption of the plastic credit card from the late 1950 's through 1993 - the direct marketing of credit cards to americans and its great success - america 's worship of star mutual fund managers like peter lynch during the 1980 's - the ineptitude of america 's elected officials to deregulate the banking industry in the face of dramatic changes in the financial services marketplace - the amazing impact money market mutual funds had on americans ' savings strategies given the inflexibility of the banking regulation q that capped savings deposit interest at around 5% while interest rates were as high as 16%+ in the early 1980 's - the significant growth and influence of fidelity investments and its leader ned johnson on the industry in the 1980 's - individual retirement accounts ( iras ) and their impact on the growing wealth of americans - the rise of nonbank banks and other non-financial companies getting into the financial services arena during the 1970 's and 1980 's - the pervasive impact and presence that andrew kahr had throughout the industry in creating new financial services products - the pollyana-ish impact of marshall loeb , editor of money magazine , had on " middle class " americans and their views of investing in securities - the amazing record of peter lynch despite the ever-growing size of the magellan fund - the slowness of merrill lynch to change along with the rest of the industry in de-emphasizing commission revenue versus asset management fees - the dramatic growth of mutual funds in the later half of the 20th century and all the billions the financial services industry makes from them each year - negotiable order of withdrawal ( now ) accounts - state laws on usury and how south dakota became the credit card capital of america - schwab 's onesource as the first ' mutual fund supermarket ' - the dramatic risks of writing naked put options in 1987 just before black monday and how it impacted charles schwab & co. - the impact of " reagonomics " on american wealth-building - the 1980 's bull market leading up to black monday - the wild success of first deposit 's first select card as designed by andrew kahr and the adverse reaction to it by consumers and watchdog groups - paul volcker 's anti-inflation policy of ratcheting up interest rates in the early 1980 's and his general resistance to deregulation of the banking industry - ted and nina wang 's amazing margin calls during and after black monday the author does a great job of depicting the very interesting characters that led the money revolution in the later half of the 20th century , including dee hock of visa , ned johnson of fidelity , peter lynch of fidelity , andrew kahr the product development consultant , roger lawson of fidelity , marshall loeb of money magazine , charles merrill of merrill lynch , president jimmy carter and his administration , donald regan of merrill lynch and the reagan administration , charles schwab , gerald tsai jr. of fidelity , paul volcker of the federal reserve , and walter wriston and john reed of citibank . the writing is crisp , clear , and easy to read . few books come out like this and mr. nocera is to be commended for this first rate work . if you are even mildly interested in any of the items listed above , you will enjoy this book . if you find the financial services industry fascinating and / or work in the industry , you will love this book . it 's a page turner ! the only drawback to this book is that it was published over a decade ago in 1994. so much has happened since then ! i encourage mr. nocera to pick up where he left off and put out a second edition that takes his readers up through 2005.

books neg 620.txt this book is trying too hard to emphasize in being funny . it is filled with mediocre ' funny ' patters that the readers are encouraged to use , but the quality of the actual magic effects demonstrated is poor . balancing two forks on the edge of a glass should not be considered magic . once you read a few samples , the reading becomes stifling , knowing that you are not going to learn anything new that other magic books cannot teach you . some areas are brighter : the photos are clear , and it blends magician bios and history within . but one can do better with other books around

dvd neg 144.txt it has been a long time since i read the novel upon which this book is based , but i do clearly remember it making sense . this movie does n't even make sense ( to quote a chicken i know ) . marlon brando somnambulizes his way through the film and , instead of coming off as sinister , menacing , and dominating , he makes dr. moreau into a joke . val kilmer 's portrayal is vacuous and silly . is the character supposed to be under the influence ? i guess he wanted it portrayed that way . the script ? is there one ? moreau talks about having almost reached his goal . where ? his one " son " and his " daughter " do have some fine traits , but both are also pretty ineffectual . several reviews have mentioned the special effects . i actually saw very few special effects . the rat-people on the boat were creepy and well-done , and some of the characters did make some superhuman moves , but mostly i saw people in very elaborate , well-done costumes , using well-distorted voices . the central character , played by david thewlis , should have been the focus of the movie , as he is the narrator . he kept getting lost in the shuffle , and i kept waiting for him to see things that i saw , and to ask the questions that i would have asked . i like him as an actor , but this is certainly not a memorably good performance . it is somewhat ironic that he is the witness to animal-human hybrid horror here , but is the werewolf in " harry potter and the prisoner of azkaban . " the film does create a sense of the nightmare . several of the characters do show glimpses of depth and genuineness , most notably ron perlman 's preacher , but then he 's well-practiced , from his " beauty and the beast " television series . that was what ( barely ) earned this film its second star . let 's vote them all off the island , and start over . robert duvall as moreau ? replace kilmer with matt damon ? casey affleck replacing david thewlis

dvd neg 153.txt if this movie was ever going to have a chance , it needed to be about 4 or 5 hours long , or never attempted in the first place . some books adapt well to being edited and condensed as a screenplay - possession just ca n't be dealt with that way . what you have as a result is another story entirely . there just was n't time enough , i guess , to develop the characters , or even to include half of them . the only character true to the book and left almost intact was sir george . the rest were stripped of their layers and everything that made them fascinating , and we are left with painful stereotypes and , in the case of roland michell , a character who seems to have wandered on to the wrong set during filming . my best advice is that if you 've read the book , skip the movie , but if you saw the movie , you should do yourself a favor and get the book

music neg 321.txt i can understand that robin felt a need to include some of the biggest bee gees hits to appease the fans , but the ones that were sung by barry are below wretched here . robin frequently disappears in the sound mix , becoming little more than one of a group singing harmony . that 's fine for a group concert , like the bee gees , but inexcusable for a solo effort . his stiff between song talk sounds like a bad lounge act . they should have kept this in the can . it seems like it is meant as little more than a money grab for robin . do n't do him the favor

books neg 543.txt i picked this book up a couple days ago with a few others , hoping to learn about america 's prison system . i think our prison system is horrible and i was hoping that this book would give me some more information on the topic . unfortunately , in the first twenty pages of the book , elsner claims that america imprisons 704 people per every 10 , 000 citizens . if you do the math , that equals 7% of our population . 7% of our population is greater than the population of the state of new york . according to this author , there are more people in prison in this country than live in the state of new york . before you get too worried , let me reassure you that this is not the case . america imprisons 736 people per *100 , 000* citizens ( as of 5 / 06 ) , or .736% of the population . this is the highest rate in the entire world , so there 's no need to move the decimal point to make it seem more dramatic . for comparison , stalin had .771% of his citizens imprisoned in the gulags during the height of the purges . again , there 's really no need to exaggerate america 's rate of incarceration . what disappoints me is that this error is not simply a typo on one page , but is repeated several times . apparently the author actually believes we imprison 7% of our population , and the editors at prentice hall think that makes sense as well , as do all the luminaries who glowingly endorsed this book on the back cover . personally , i ca n't take anything this author says seriously if there are errors so blatant a novice in the subject can them pick out , on the first twenty pages no less . if a subject as basic as prison population is exaggerated by a power of 10 , how do we know the rest of the book is n't off by a power of 10 ? elsner makes prison reform advocates look like the bunch of uninformed dreamers conservatives like to imagine . do n't buy this book

software pos 482.txt i 've used version 2003 and enjoyed it thoroughly . i primarily used it for school with different classes and notes for each . what was great is that is consolidates everything in a way that makes it easy to retrieve your notes . it also makes it easy to generate reports based on the tagging feature . the tags allow you to highlight and gather key points of information that make writing papers a breeze . when working with paper , this was not always an easy task to take on . several weeks ago , i downloaded the trial version of onenote 2007. the improvements are rather subtle , but powerful . it did n't take anything to get comfortable with the new features . after a short time with the trial version i just purchased it because it was so much fun . here are some of the beneficial features : -like a paper notebook you have sections , but with onenote 2007 you can have as many sections as you like . -you can easily link pages to outlook . i have linked appointments to a series of notes and support files for various projects and meetings . it makes being organized for a meeting a breeze . -also , it 's a great way to archive emails in a way that allows you to see them and organize them as you wish . you can empty your in box and at the same time keep a record of important emails . well worth your time . -it is also tablet friendly if you use a tablet pc like i do . i love it for that use . there is a fantastic text recognition feature that works extremely well . if you use a tablet , this is a great feature . -as was with the earlier version , you can add voice content to your notes . that 's right , voice recorded messages can be added to your notes . too cool . before you buy , you might want to go to the microsoft site and download the trial version . you 'll be able to assess for yourself . i think you 'll be pleased . i fond it to be one of the best products for ' electronic file keeping ' that i 've used . for the price , it 's not a bad deal .
dvd pos 222.txt barbershop is a rare event in african-american filmmaking . it 's one of the few that actually tells a fairly accurate story of what life is like for african-americans . i love the fact that the movie showed how diverse the african-american community is ; we see black people from different walks of life and different lifestyles shown onscreen . i really liked this movie . we definitely need more films like this calvin is the owner of a chicago barbershop passed on to him by his late father . mired in debt from the shop and his crazy business schemes , calvin is desperate to start something of his own and feels that the barbershop is a hindrance on his life . it 's not until he sells the barbershop to a loan shark that he realizes the value of the shop to the community and sees a role for himself in the neighborhood . there are a dozen other stories that link to this main one and they 're all easy to follow . one follows a stolen atm machine , one follows the quest for love of an african immigrant , another follows a female barber and her cheating boyfriend , another follows a guy desperate for a haircut to go to a job interview , and yet another follows a white barber 's quest for acceptance by the black barbers he works with . in a way , this film reminded me of those great ensemble movies like pulp fiction that follow many characters and their stories . each of the stories lead up to the ending where calvin saves the barbershop . director tim story does a great job of capturing life in chicago and the informal environment of the barbershop . i felt the spirit of the windy city and the informal environment of the barbershop . watching the conversations in the movie reminded me of the barbershop in harlem my father used to take me to when i was a boy . it also reminded me of the charged atmosphere of the old barbershop i used to go to get my flat-top trimmed ( both are closed now . ) : ( there are a ton of great performances in this movie ; i 'm probably going to miss mentioning a few people . ice cube is great as calvin . i liked his performance here . michael ealy stands out in his role as an ex-con trying to turn his life around by becoming a barber . ealy makes you feel his characters ' desperation . cedric the entertainer makes a breakthrough performance as an old barber . he 's funny and poignant . sean nelson is great as an educated man who works as a barber while going to college . anthony anderson and larenz tate are hilarious as two bumbling thieves who steal an atm with no money in it . watching them try to open will make you laugh . keith david is creepy as the loan shark . then again , keith david is always good in anything he does . i 'd pay money to watch him and sam jackson read listings in the yellow pages . i do n't know why movie critics and the rev . jesse jackson denounced barbershop , it 's one of the best movies ever made about african-american life . looking at the box office of barbershop and diary of a mad black woman , african-americans actually want more films like this . as a black moviegoer i want different black films that allow the world to see the whole community , not just one small part of it . i for one and tired of the " hood " movies like never die alone , and critically acclaimed movies like monster 's ball and hustle & flow that depict black life as something negative . ( thankfully , it seems the rest of the black community is tired of these types of movies too , the box office and dvd sales for them is declining while the box office for movies like barbershop and diary of a mad black woman are going up . ) end of rant , back to the review . a shawn james essential five star video . you must buy this movie . get some friends together put the dvd in the machine , pull up a chair and have a seat in front of the tv and hang out at the barbershop .
dvd pos 744.txt i have always been a fan of movies that mix special effect animation with live action and the mask is no exception . i would also have to say that the mask is one of a kind in terms of unique films . there are many good things about this film aside from the well written script and good acting but i think the one thing that shines the most about the mask is the special effects and the humor that goes along with it . for those of you who do n't know , a big portion of the effects and humor from this movie stem from the old tex avery cartoons such as droopy the dog and the lone wolf who lusts after the nightclub dancer in a red dress ( this feature is shown in the bonus section of the dvd ) . these kind of cartoons were always my favorite growing up aside from looney tunes . getting back on the subject , what i also found thrilling about the mask is how well the dog milo was trained to perform certain task . if you have seen this movie , you know what i 'm talking about . the training of the dog is also shown in the bonus section of the dvd . the movie itself was a take-off of the comic series of the mask . though not quite as dark as the comics , the film itself managed to portray enough adult humor and semi-violence so that the mask would not be deemed as a children 's film hence the pg-13 rating . a big plus to the mask was how jim carrey portrayed the different character traits of stanley ipkis and stanley ipkis wearing the mask . another big plus about this movie is the main villain getting hold of the mask . and of course , who can dislike ben stein 's typical character of a monotone man with sarcastic remarks ? oh , and cameron diaz is an absolute babe in this movie as well . as for the dvd , this re-release is an improvement from the previous . you get 5.1 surround sound along with a crisp widescreen picture . the added bonus features are also great and should be viewed to appreciate what was put in to making this movie

camera neg 516.txt i bought this almost exactly 2 years ago , and i turned it on the other day and went to take a picture indoors that required a flash , and the flash would not work . it was set to automatic flash . using the auto setting , i thought there used to be 3 flash settings ( auto , forced flash and no flash ) , but now there were only 2. i took it outside on a sunny day and used the auto flash , and the flash went off outside ! something is messed up and it has the light and dark confused . thinking i hit something and changed a setting , i reset it to the factory defaults and it still does n't work . it will probably be too expensive to get it fixed , and it 's weird but i just upgraded to a nikon d50. i must have known this camera was about to die . even when it worked , half the time pictures came out blurry . i either got fantastic crystal clear shots or blurry ones as if the auto focus missed . maybe the camera was defective the entire time i had it . no more canons for me
books neg 904.txt a gold sticker on this book 's cover reads & quot ; winner of the nobel prize for literature . &quot ; do n't be mislead . the sticker must refer to the author not the book . while he no doubt received the prize , after wading through the work i ca n't believe it was for this piece of work . i found the book exceedingly boring , a chore to read every step of the way . as the iberian peninsula physically separates from europe , several unengaging and underdeveloped characters ( the most interesting of which was a dog ) wander from one destination to another with meager purposes , certainly none i cared about . while the book may have been intended as an allegory for portugal 's relationship with the rest of europe and the european union , it failed to strike a chord . i 'll chalk this book up as something only a pulitzer prize judge would love
books pos 737.txt i should first confess my bias- -i have often been tickled and sometimes awed by mortimer 's way with english prose for 20 years . so , in picking up this book i had the high expectations one might have before meeting an old friend or beloved teacher . no disappointment . even if some of these essays are slightly less effervescent than others , all are at least wonderful , and several are both brilliant and touching . mortimer has given us a collection of short essays , conversational and often wryly funny , which he intends as a kind of spiritual bequeathal to his family and other heirs . the chapters range across a broad range of subjects , some perhaps outwardly frivolous , like the cooking of eggs . but in the main , mortimer touches on matters of great substance- -the nature of beauty , how to be happy , surprising ways in which our world has managed to be unjust , places and times for sex , how to dine sociably , the love of children , faith and reason , the terrors of the writer facing blank paper , and many more . i found these essays to be wise and absolutely delicious . i suspect that readers who have enjoyed rumpole , or mortimer 's other biographical essays like summer of a doormouse , or clinging to the wreckage , will be quite pleased with these sketches . mortimer may , sadly , be nearing the end of his life , but at present he seems to be on a literary tear . i , for one , wish him many more prolific years

books neg 194.txt i 'm not a cosmologist , but stephen hawking 's universe was so simply written it is essentially condescending . the language is akin to the level one would read in a newspaper . moreover , the pictures are second rate pre-contact lense hubble knock-offs ( despite being published in 1997 ) , and the book has very little to do with stephen hawking . sure , he wrote the foreward and did some editing , but it lacks the wit and wonder of a hawking work . naming the book after him and putting his picture on the front is misleading . i am a chemist , and despite this , filkin 's descriptions of chemical discoveries left even me guessing because he was attempting to dumb-down ideas that are n't dumb-downable , and did n't include diagrams which would be helpful for anyone trying to understand the concepts ( like neutrino capturing or particle acceleration ) . if you want to learn some cosmology , read & quot ; a brief history of time&quot ; or & quot ; a short history of the universe&quot ; . these are simply written but informative works that wo n't leave you waiting for substance

music pos 533.txt 1990. it dose n't seem like that lond ago . when a barley known mariah carey stuns the world with a powerful 5 octave voice that hase n't been heard since minnie ripperton . she made her appearance when she signed on to columbia records after the now forgotten brenda k . starr , whom mariah was a backup singer for at the time , gave tommy mottola a demo tape of her songs and the rest was history . now about the album . the album starts off with her first single " vision of love " a powerful song that spent weeks atop the charts and made mariah a star . you can feel the suspence as mariah builds up to the bridge and gives the world their first hearing of her beautiful 5 octave voice . truly to this day , still one of her best songs . " there 's got to be away " changes pace from love to world issues that are still relevent today . this was released as a single in the u.k. ( it was n't released in the u.s. for fear that it would break her string of four number one hits ) yet it failed to chart . " someday " is the next song and was the albums third single . it too hit number one in 1991. this song is great to hear after a breakup as mariah warns an ex-lover that " the one you gave away will be the only one your looking for . " this song may seem a little out dated now as it still has some heavy 80 's synth beats . " i do n't want to cry " was the albums fourth and , in the u.s. , the last release . it too hit number one in the summer of 1991 and within a year mariah had a whopping four number one hits under her belt . something that will not be accomplished for a long , long time . though mariah has declared her hatred for the song as she fought over the production of the song and was dissatisfied with the final product , the song still has all the work of a great mariah song and it is the only song that mariah does not hit her famous whistle register with . " vanishing " , though never becoming a single , is probably one of the best mariah recordings . a gospel like song with amazing vocals over a pounding piano is enough to make anyone think their in heaven . though the song is spookey enough at the chorus when she softly coos " swiftly you 're vanishing , drifting away . " it has also been called a " hidden treasure " by many reviewers . " all in your mind " is another song that realy showcase mariah 's vocal capabilities . though this is one of the few songs that sound dated , but definatly worth a listen . " alone in love " is a song that is soft and pleading would make anyone run back to mariah . truley a mariah great . the next two songs , " you need me " and " sent up from above , " really are the weakest tracks on the album and do bring down the feel of the album . they also sound dated and are not the style in which mariah is famous for . still , every mariah song is worth a listen , so go for it ! " prisoner " is a truley a great mariah tune . though this has a rock influence as well , she does a great job with the vocals and the lyrics stay insode your head . this almost became a single in the u.s. but mariah finished her new album quicker than originaly planned . " love takes time " truly will have a place in my heart . every time i hear this song it takes me back to 1990 , almost like a little time machine . putting this song on her first record almost did n't happen , as mariah har intended it to be on her next record . though tommy mottola and other executives persuaded her to . the style is not that different than " vision of love , " where it build untill the brige where mariah lets off her signature high note . this was also the second single of the album and became her second number one in late 1990. though music box , daydream , and the emancipation of mimi would go onto break records and are considered some of mariah 's best albums , there is no way you can leave this one out . this album truley is the one that started it all . to this date it has gone 9x platinum and made carey into a star and would be the start of years and years of great music from the voice of this generation . though this album was heavily criticized for being to similar and formulaic to paula abdul , janet jackson , and especially whitney houston , it still ranks as one of the best albums of the 90 's and of all time . for some people this album may be a time capsule of 1990 and for others who are now expiriencing this music for the first time one fact will always be true . this is one of the best debuts and albums ever and was the start of a simple long island girl named mariah carey , who became a superstar .

software pos 687.txt i 'm a pc mechanic . i have been using ad-aware with ad-watch ( now called ad-aware plus ) for the last 5 years . it 's pretty good at what it does , but there is newer technology that is going to replace it soon . i 've never had any problems with these program - it does not add any malware - it removes it . however , using ad-aware and ad-watch to their fullest does take some computer savvy - as it seems does any anti-malware on the market these days . all of the other runtime problems the other reviewers here have reported are " fixable " by using the controls and tweaks in the software , so that you are not overprotecting your system - one example , the pop-up blocker in ad-watch is adjustable as to its intensity . however , this requires changing two settings - one in ad-watch itself and one in ad-aware . and , yes , at times , i have had to turn ad-watch off to download a file or see a popup i wanted . soooo ? software these days is not as " automatic " as the companies would have you believe . if you 're not willing to take the time to learn ( which also means going to the company 's online user forums and asking questions ) , just stick with what windows offers , do n't use outlook or outlook express ( major source of malware on pcs ) and only look at websites you know are safe .

dvd neg 929.txt this movie has been done over and over again , with different actors and by different directors , but the plot is stale and has gotten extremely boring . do n't bother with another cookie cutter movie of this kind... . buy something original or save your money
dvd neg 953.txt this is a bad movie not only because it does n't fit chronologically in terms of feel and content . it 's like this film attempts to create turtles psychaitry 101. each turtle attempts to work on and / or completely vanquish their weaknesses . leo learns to be a better leader by being a better individual ninja , mikey learns to be caring and heroic in addition to his usual humorous banter , raphael learns to control his temper by doing peaceful things while befriending children , and i believe that donny falls in love . it 's been awhile since i 've seen this film so i may have that last thing wrong . more than ten years have passed since i saw this stinker and although i do n't remember every minute detail the problems that i had with it are enormous . first , the time travel plotline is a risky stretch for this series even though the conception of the turtles is vaguely sci-fi . the television series and films have n't really gleamed upon that aspect , instead relying on action , humor , and pseudo wisdom from splinter to pass off a complete and perfect product . in my opinion the separate storylines of the turtles is what ruines the movie and that is the result of the time travel plot . in particular , leo 's and raphael 's storylines simply drag the film down in an obvious way by placing them within contexts they should never be in . the pathos in these scenes is just too thick and is best in this series when it was dished out in moments . they just feel heavy handed . that 's not to say mikey 's plotline is n't just as bad , but he 's allowed to get away with some of it because the kids are pretty cute , but the scene with the house burning down is right out of a war movie and is not exhilarating at all . secondly , the action is just not there as it was before . sure , it 's still pretty bloodless , but the scenes are few and far between and boring . the turtles have been robbed of their seemingly invincible skills when they work together and the action has been in a more battlefield context so it loses a lot of it 's previous effects of catharsis . it felt like i was watching the history channel special about the history of the turtles war in japan and they lost . also , the explosion at the end inside the bell was straight out of a warner brothers cartoon and not in character with the turtles . having the bad guy killed off with the bomb would have been inappropriate too . i 'm just the kind of guy who likes ( in these kinds of movies ) the bad guys to get a death that you do n't have to see , or feel the impact of because you ca n't imagine when their end comes , like falling down a bottomless pit . to me , bombs are out of the question in terms of death . thirdly , the humor suffers as much as the action because they have little opportunity to do it and when they do it feels forced and is not funny . an example would be a moment when two of the turtles are following , or running from bad guys and they 're going up stairs , lots of stairs and mikey goes , " this is good for my calfs , " i was thinking , " what , is my mom supposed to laugh at that ? " as for the japanese men who take to american living all too well , none of it is very funny at all and reflecting on it now , it 's like saying that just being drunk is funny as opposed to actually doing something funny when drunk , painfully unfunny and pointless . equally as pointless was the use of casey jones . his character in the first movie almost steals the show at times , but in this movie he has nothing to do except watch over the japanese men . in a way this is also doing to him what the film is doing to the turtles , forcing him to work on things that would be better worked out as moments not plotlines . in this story the writers would have casey jones completely emasculated , possibly for laughs , possibly for moral . the former is definitely not the case , the latter is underdeveloped . it 's like he says early in film to the turtles asking where are more people to fight , that 's what we 're thinking for a majority of the film . in retrospect , the japanese men might be a parallel for the turtles showing an example of what the writers probably think the turtles would be like if they were completely worthless . so he has the turtles learning powerful life lessons away from splinter to show how meaningful and worthy they are to detractors of the series . i admit , it 's a good idea but way too heavy handed . the meaning is always better in small doses . finally , the song used in the film toward the end with the japanese men in the bar is such a good song and is very exciting . it was used to great effect in the tv spots for the film to make the audience believe going into the theatre that it was going to an exciting , funny , action-adventure and instead they gave us this stale role reversal film that tarnishes the turtles legacy and insured that there would never be another turtles film . oh well , at least found out the name of that song
camera neg 939.txt i purchase this instrument twice . the first time there were black specks in the lense , so it was returned . the second time was worst , i.e. same black specs but the thing did n't work at all . i have also checked this manufacturer 's other models out and most come with the disturbing black specks in the lense . this is n't a quality optical product
software neg 564.txt background - senior it professional . i have been a quicken user for well over a decade and have always been very happy with the product until the 2007 version . first , let me point out a couple of things to like about this version : - the interface ; seems to depend on the eye of the beholder , but i for one find it pleasing and useful . - the ability to append notes and check images to a transaction . i love this feature . - the cash flow dashboard and the calendar now for the caveat : if you depend a great deal on downloading transactions using webconnect , prepare for a great deal of frustration and disappointment . this feature used to work reliably in all other versions . in version 2007 it is prone to quit with a notice that there has been a " quicken server outage " that prevented the download from succeeding . these occurrences are sporadic . scores of users are reporting this on the support forums and elsewhere ; i have seen no hint of a response or explanation from intuit . horror stories about tech support at intuit have kept me away from that venue , though at some point i 'll call just to see what happens . i upgraded to 2007 from a very solid and dependable quicken 2006 , and this issue alone has made me wish that i hadn't . weighing the new features against the new bugs i would have to say that i do not recommend purchasing this version at this time
camera neg 998.txt this camcorder is terrible in just about every way : cons : - unacceptably blurry video ; the specs say it records at 640x480 , but it looks more like 320x240 ( if that ! ) blown up to vga . - noticeable aura around any dark shape on a lighter background . - awful light sensitivity ; forget about recording indoors- -no matter how brightly the room is lit , faces will come out too dark . the built-in led 's do n't help much ( and not at all at distances over 4 feet from the subject ) . - noisy zoom that gets picked up loud and clear by the microphone . - zooming goes in irregular steps- -completely useless while recording . - video lags noticeably behind camera movement ; when image stabilization is turned on , the lag becomes so atrocious that you ca n't tell when to stop panning- -utterly useless ! - when using av-in and av-out cables , the firmware has frozen on me a couple of times ; the only way to reset the camera was to remove the battery . - video encoding ( through the av-in cable ) produces an unacceptably noisy and undersaturated result . - the lcd display has a very narrow viewing angle ; anything more than about 10% and you ca n't make out a thing . - still photos taken at the native 5mp resolution come out strangely grainy and uneven- -something like a " sharpen " effect gone wrong . i can get better looking pictures with my 2mp canon powershot a40 camera . - the manual recommends keeping the camera motionless for 2-3 seconds after snapping a picture ( that 's on top of the 3-4 seconds it takes the thing to focus before it snaps ) ; but you ca n't keep the subject from moving , folks ! welcome to the psychedelic land of image trails.. . - flash photos come out with wildly different color balance depending on the color of the background . - the manual is a sorry affair- -only 17 pages long and does n't go much beyond identifying external controls and menu options . - i could go on and on , but i 'll stop now , as you probably get the picture.. . pros : - the camera body seems sturdily built ; the controls also have a sturdy feel to them , as do the battery and the usb port covers . hmm.. . it 's the only nice thing i can think to say about it . maybe a child ( think pre-teen ) could find this " camcorder " exciting as a toy , but i do n't see how it can be enough even for an undemanding person looking to capture occasional life 's moments on video
dvd pos 888.txt this is an imaginative take on the jack and the beanstalk story . while it was apparently made for kids , the story maintains enough complexity to keep adults interested ( i 'm 19 ) . plus as a female , i appreciate the fact that it 's one of the few stories where ( possible spoiler ) the damsel ( who 's in a different kind of distress than other fairy tale women ) rescues prince charming . well-acted , it features some great chemistry between sara and modine . but i still ca n't give it 5 stars . here 's why ( spoilers ahead ) : 1. i 'm no math person but why could n't the writers be consistent with when jack 's dad died ? one minute , they say he died 20 years ago but then they say he died when jack was 14. since jack is 37 , it shows that the writers ca n't do simple addition . could n't they just take two seconds to do the math ? 2. how the hell does siggy know about goose and harp ? i got the impression from wilhemina that jack 's dad did n't believe the story of the original jack . but apparently , jack 's dad told siggy not to tell him about the family 's dark secret until he was ready . i wish there was a more believable explanation for siggy knowing a lot more than he should . 3. if siggy is smart enough to know the all the robinson secrets , i think he should be able to catch on to the fact that jack is in love with ondine fairly quickly . i always wondered why he did n't try to kill ondine when he was so against jack having an heir . i understand that they had a time limit to the movie and maybe it would have been a bit scary for the little ones . do n't get me wrong , i do n't want ondine to die . i wanted nothing less than a happy ending for her and jack . but shooting her ( or at least threatening her ) would have been a great way to kick up the tension / suspense . 4. siggy 's accent and mannerisms were an attempt at comedy that completely fell flat . it was not funny and was a bit gratuitous . but if you 're a fan of romance , adventure , or just feel-good movies in general , those things should n't keep you from enjoying this film . do n't think too much about the plot holes - you 'll go insane if you do

books neg 121.txt no doubt about it . this book covers the history of the border patrol . however , it falls far short of what it ostensibly bills itself and ends up more as a " fluff piece " than anything else . as someone who has not only served as a senior border patrol agent ( 13 years ) but also a border patrol union president and outspoken critic of the agency , i have studied this agency inside and out without the affects of tunnel vision that typically accompany the job ( many say a necessity ) . pacheco , as an active agent ( when he wrote the book at least ) , appears headed in the right direction with the book and then suddenly veers off target . his somewhat ambiguous message that border security is a difficult task is obviously an attempt to straddle the line ( i apologize for the pun ) so as not to appear too contentious or controversial . did he need to seek agency approval for publication since he was actively employed ? if so , then the credibility issue leaps out and the book is worth the historical content alone if nothing else . if he did not need agency approval and was truly writing without restraint , then he failed to accurately convey the real state of the border patrol and border security . simply put , the border patrol , as with most of the homeland security subcomponents is disintegrating . remember the incompetence of fema ( a homeland security subcomponent ) ? well , multiply that incompetence times ten . heard about the poor morale of fema employees ? multiply that problem by one-hundred and you have an accurate picture of the border patrol . a border patrol in which the vast majority of otherwise employable agents spend ninety-percent of their time trying to get out . those that choose to stay in do so only because of the comparatively worse off agencies in dhs . the bottom line is that as a former agent , i lose sleep at night knowing what i know . pacheco did cover the rigorous training regimen accurately even if it bordered on propaganda . that alone may attract candidates to the difficult and completely unrewarding position of u.s. border patrol agent . the field stories are completely unappealing to anyone who served more than a week in a law enforcement position unless they are reading about their own exploits . read the book for enjoyment and homage . just do n't expect critical analysis . in fact , this book would be an enjoyable read at stewarts bridge ( for you ib agents in san diego ) .

software neg 43.txt do n't take my word for it that 's a quote from the title of a recent post excoriating this irritating and increasingly bloated product on slashdot . be warned : adobe has not learned its lesson , and despite the outcry that followed the release of version 6 , this latest release of acrobat continues adobe 's aggressive trend of intruding into your desktop environment , again , as in version 6 without providing an easy way to undo the damage once its done- -in fact , it 's now nearly impossible . like earlier releases , this version of acrobat adds startup macros and new toolbar buttons to your existing applications and adds menu entries to your desktop " right click " menus . adobe argues that these are conveniences , but they are entirely unnecessary ( for most of us " printing " to adobe pdf achieves the same result , is much more convenient , and a more natural model ) , and clutter what for most users is either a too-crowded user interface ( for those who do n't have the knowledge or patience to customize it ) or a carefully tuned one ( for those who do ) . unlike many well-behaved applications that provide obvious ways of avoiding this kind of intrusive and disruptive behavior ( e.g. through a simple checkbox option in a settings dialog ) , acrobat 's " option " for disabling this behavior , once deeply hidden in the setup process , is now almost completely absent . to disable the " convert to adobe pdf " button that mysteriously appears in the outlook mail editor , for example , one has to be sure to choose " this feature will not be available " from the " microsoft outlook " option under " acrobat pdfmaker " under " create adobe pdf " . simply deleting the button using outlook 's toolbar customization feature will not work : it comes right back when the editor is next opened . similar problems arise in word , excel , visio , project , and internet explorer . and there 's simply no way to get rid of the never-used " convert to adobe pdf " and " combine in acrobat.. . " entries in that appear in the desktop context menus for files ( even if one installs none of the acrobat pdfmaker features ) . for the technically inclined wishing to repair some of the damage that acrobat 7 does , there are complex but largely effective step by step instructions available on the web , but even the authors of these are driven to despair by version 7 : ( " adobe has really pushed the boat out with acrobat 7 and managed to screw word royally " ) . in short , acrobat will make a mess of your working environment , there 's no way to completely fix it , and even the partial fix is a pain ( and not well documented ) . ( this may seem a minor issue , but if every application followed adobe 's reckless example , our working environments would start to look like strip malls , crowded with features screaming for our attention to the point where it is hard to find what we need when we need it . one of the great strengths of the personal computer desktop is that users can configure it in ways that suit their needs ; no application should interfere with that . ) experienced acrobat users will also notice that this version continues another frustrating trend for acrobat ( and most other adobe applications ) : it is yet again slower to launch than the previous version . in fact , on my 2 ghz pentium 4 , it takes longer to launch than the entire visual studio .net development environment , and longer than the boot sequence for windows xp ! there are other minor problems as well ( arbitrary rearrangements of menu and tool bar items , etc. ) but these two major flaws are more than bad enough . unless you really need the latest acrobat features , you should probably avoid this upgrade . and if the " improvements " in this release are any indication of where adobe plans to go with future releases , it may be time to start looking elsewhere for a tool for digital document management . fortunately , there 's no reason at all to upgrade . version 7 offers no usefully new features , so you can ( and should ) avoid this one ( at all costs )

dvd neg 158.txt i 'm puzzled as to why anyone should pay $59.39 for these three dvds that currently retail on amazon for $11.24 ( signs ) , $14.99 ( unbreakable ) , and $26.99 ( sixth sense* ) totaling $53.22 ? *there is also a less expenseive " collector 's version " of the sixth sense that only costs $14.99 if you 'd rather not pay the $12.00 for the " vista series " extras . i 'm also skeptical as to whether the version of unbreakable sold here has as much content as the vista series edition sold seperately that contains 2 discs ( i assume this edition does not because this box set only includes 3 discs , 1 per movie ) . i love the movies , but where 's the price break on buying them all together when the package is $6.17- $18.17 more than purchasing these dvd 's seperately ? ? ?

books neg 965.txt after reading the trilogy , i was left wondering what the hell happened ? i have just read all 3 of the his dark materials trilogy and what was a strong start in book 1 and 2 is utterly demolished in this clunker . pullman allowed his eagerness to bash religion to completely destroy an engaging story - one of the most creative stories i 've come across in 20 years of reading fantasy . there is n't even a remote chance of a sequel to fix up this mess . if you look up ` anticlimax ' in the dictionary , you 'll see a picture of this book . from first page to last , time is wasted on boring characters , while all the good ones are either killed off , or just mia for the entire book . spoilers ahead . what about lyra and her parents ? somehow , she never knows what happened to them and after all she has been through is supposed to be content with going back to school like a good little girl ? she never even confronts them to try and understand their motivations . and will just goes back with mary malone to her apartment so they can figure out how to avoid the cops . over a cup of tea , naturally . and that 's it for him . in addition to all that , this book does n't even seem to be connected to the first two . none of the characters resonate they way they used to and instead of being good friends , will and lyra fall in love and have sex at the tender age of 11 or 12 . . . all in the last 30 pages . what happened to the story , for cripes sake ? ! and what happened to the ` temptation ' ? was choosing not to stay with will her way of not succumbing to it ? the whole premise is just so lame to start out with . as an earlier reviewer pointed out all the windows that were opened for centuries did n't endanger the universe , why not leave one open for 60 or 70 years to give lyra and will a chance to know each other . the flimsy reasoning behind this is just as contrived as their sudden and immediate love for one another . supposedly , they had more than gonads going for them , they survived death together ! pullman did n't feel like thinking it through , he just wanted a gut wrenching ending . in addition to that , he wanted to mock the reader by taunting us with the ` reality ' of knowing that nothing they did in the trilogy has any hope or meaning . all of will and lyra 's efforts are futile , kind of like - guess what ? religion for the rest of us morons . after having the reader go through endless pages on the mulefa-elephant aliens or whatever , ultimately the characters the reader wants to know about disappear with barely a whimper . iorek byrnison , lee scoresby - instead we get page after page about mary malone the disaffected former nun . pullman all but pants in his eagerness to give the finger to anyone of us who believes in him or anything for that matter ! this is not children 's literature , it 's a hate ridden manifesto that is more suitable for adults who at least have some way of maintaining some sort of perspective throughout this sloppy mess . it 's totally dishonest to sell this as a children 's book , or even as a competent work of fiction . all of the painstaking work of the first two books is undone with this one . we never get closure on lyra 's parents . we never really understand what dust is and where it comes from . we never see will reunited with his mother . we get a lame battle where ` god ' dies and no one even knows why or how . lyra and will fall in love , but have to ` sacrifice ' it so that all the windows to other worlds can be shut forever , with only flimsy reasoning behind it . the mulefa and mary malone 's work together amounts to nothing , everyone just goes home . presumably , will goes home , although we never see it . all that yearning after his mother and so forth . . .nothing . the major enemies are killed off too easily - and what about armageddon ? what happened to the fortress and all the rebel angels and . . .you get the idea . it all just sort of disovles . mary forgot to be the serpent , or else i missed that in one of the countless pages on the mulefa . another reader pointed out : " phillip pullman could have written a masterpiece with this series . instead , the story falls flat under the weight of the author 's own agendas and mockeries . what a waste of time . i ca n't believe this book actually won awards . it stopped being thought-provoking and started being inane and silly . " it would have been better if lyra had just awakened one morning and it was all a dream . instead , relearning how to read the alethiometer will somehow enable her to build the kingdom of heaven in the course of her lifetime . absurd . this was one of the most disappointing and infuriating reads of my life .

camera neg 598.txt got this camera for my wife - a digital novice - during christmas 2005. camera is easy to use and takes good pictures . easily interfaces with pc through usb . however , i also ( as did another reviewer ) started having problems after about 11 months . camera would not take pictures as the ccd went bad . luckily i had an extended service contract and it was repaired . unfortunately , it just quit working again ( april 2007 ) and the service contract company says they " ...wo n't bother fixing it again.. . " and is refunding my purchase price . gracious but a hassle doing without a camera for a second time . good camera but if you buy one make sure you get the service contract
software neg 614.txt i bought a new pc last week and maxed it out with a gig of ram and 512 video card...vista was preinstalled.. . these are the basic specs of the pc i have : athlon 64 x2 dual core processor 2 gig memory ddr 2 250 sata hdd not only did this thing run slow...i found out that a lot of my old software would n't work...what gives ? ? ? ? i ran company of heroes ( seemingly a surefire bet considering the upgrades ) and that crawles like i was trying to run this on a minimum spec'ed machine...and mind u i bought this new and did upgrades ( an extra 250 dollars worth ) so i wound up spending a nice part of saturday reformatting the hdd and putting xp back on my machine and viola ! i really get to see whta kind of power i am working with.. . for those of you thinking about going back to xp , do it and wait until vista gets figured out...it 's 250 dollar resource hog and it wo n't be on my machine for a little while...and while u are at it...please be sure to back up your drivers files.. .
music neg 650.txt vote this one off the island : 19 overproduced prog-tropical instrumentals consisting entirely of primitive thumping , chanting and grunting - sort of a new age tribal orgy with pygmy porn music composed by phil collins . it 's all supposed to convey the drama , intrigue and relevance of a tv show ( survivor yell , mud bath , chase race , tally the vote , i can see it , buzzed ) with no drama , intrigue and relevance . a desperate last ditch dig for one of the most unimportant moments in television
books neg 613.txt i thoroughly enjoyed the author 's earlier work on how the irish saved civilization . but this book was a disappointing compendium of greek myths , legends and history that never reveals a plan behind the book . taken in its subparts , many sections are engagingly informative in an elegant if sometimes pretentious prose . yet the author ambles from here to there in a disjointed narrative with interesting nuggets but little insight . where 's the big picture ? the author attempts to wrap it up at the end with a sentence about the greeks ' " variety of human response , lightening quick transmutations , resourcefulness , and inexhaustible creativity . " a subtitle like " a greek treasury of personal vignettes " might have been more descriptive and merited another star . but it falls short as a " hinge of history " with impoverished and even maladaptive connections ( fdr as solon - really ? ) to the modern world . i am sorry to not recommend it .

camera pos 923.txt this is a pretty good camera , loaded with lots of features . the pros include the 10x optical zoom , use of sd card , and battery consumption . also , with this camera you have the ability to buy add-ons such as zoom lenses and such - makes it nice for those that are just past beginner experience . there are a couple of cons that i 've found , the most important being the picture quality . although it does have the capability to take great photos , you have to make sure and wait several seconds between shots to ensure that they 'll come out looking great ( in my opinion , anyway ) . the size is okay , although it is kinda bulky for being so small . i prefer something that size to also be slim - it 's not so easy to carry around because of this . overall , this camera is very easy to use

dvd pos 481.txt & quot ; monkey business&quot ; looks pretty good on dvd 50 years later . the restoration comparison on the dvd shows the change the restoration brought , a bit darkly tinted , and more defined . the wild plot keeps you glued to the screen throughout . marilyn monroe who is the star on the dvd box has more of a supporting role here . she is great as the secretary lois laurel who shows up early because the boss does n't like her punctuation . cary grant as the addled professor barnaby fulton turns in a great journeyman performance , getting appropriately loony when experiencing the euphoria of youth . his driving sequence with monroe had me turning in my chair with laughter to avoid the trucks ! ginger rogers as wife edwina gets pretty wacky when returned to youth . if all youth were as lighthearted as these comedic versions , it 'd be a laugh and guffaw every time the school bell rings . hugh marlowe as the straight-laced attorney hank entwhistle does a nice job of standing stoic during the crazy indian game . oscar winner charles coburn ( 1943 , the more the merrier ) does a great job of appreciating monroe 's assets as oliver oxly , the ceo . kathleen freeman as mrs. brannigan gives a fine performance . the dvd offers perviews of many monroe films . this is a great little piece of cinematic history . turn back the clock & amp ; enjoy

music pos 248.txt i ca n't even begin to say how much i love these albums ( i just picked uyi 1 to write my review for both ) . everyone always says that appetite is guns best album...no way in hell . the illusion albums are so much richer . now do n't get me wrong , i love appetite but it is more of a party album with cool guitar work and catchy tunes . the illusion twins are just so much deeper lyrically and have many more styles woven in and out of a hard rock framework . i can identify with so many of axls lyrics , and the music just makes them stand out so much more . slash is basically the best hard rock guitar player ever , and he has more awesome solos and leads on these albums than most guitar players have in a career . and the best part about these albums is that the lesser known songs are usually the best , such as : locomotive , bad apples , dont damn me , the garden , pretty tied up , coma , civil war , get in the ring , breakdown , estranged ( kind of popular but still fairly unknown ) 14 years , bad obscession , dust n bones , dead horse , and more . then of course there are the hits , dont cry , november rain , knockin on heavens door , live and let die , you could be mine etc. the only songs i dont really like that much are my world ( wtf ? ) and shotgun blues , but everything else is just so gdamn good . do yourself a favor and go buy these albums if u consider yourself a hard rock fan . the illusion albums are art , plain and simple
books neg 837.txt it 's hard to imagine this book being of much value even for a true and complete novice to prospecting . written with blatant self promotion in mind for other garrett products there is little if any substantive information on panning that could not be reduced to 4 or 5 pages with a couple of diagrams added . would appear author may have been paid by the word given the tedious repetitions found throughout . truly basic and nothing new here - spend your money elsewhere
software pos 69.txt i have used this software from the very first as a paintshop product and it still delivers . it has improved with this version . i reckon i have tried all other albums and quick editors but this remains the best . for more detailed work a more expansive editor is needed but that is not the purpose of this program . what it claims to do , it does well . if only it had some way of adjusting the mid tones . a simple histogram would make this a top ranking program
music pos 64.txt one of the best doobie collections out there " greatest hits " lives up to its name focusing on the singles the band recorded and that charted in their long career . some of the songs here are the single versions ( meaning they were edited and are shorter than the album versions ) and this might be a problem for some fans as they may want the full length versions of songs . maybe it 's because they were trying to squeeze more music onto the cd . either way fans may want to be aware of that . in fact even on the boxed set we get " listen to the music " , " nobody " and " rockin ' down the highway " in their single incarnations . perhaps its because that was the way fans originally heard them on the radio . either way , fans looking for the full length versions of these songs would do well to pick up one of the import " greatest hits " collections or wait for the remastered cds coming out later this year . this set does have one track not on the boxed set- - " without you " a great rocker . the cd booklet is exactly like the larger booklet that comes with the boxed set just laid out a bit differently . this definitely covers the highlights of the band 's career whether it be the tom johnston rockin ' years , michael mcdonald 's blue-eyed soul stage or the band 's reunion phase this has a bit of it all . personally , i would love to see a two disc distillation of the band 's " greatest hits " with a second disc of album tracks such as " i cheat the hangman " , " losin ' end " , " the captain and me " and " how do the fools survive ? " . in the meantime this single disc compilation will have to do for most fans . the sound is terrific pulling from the remasters produced by bill inglot for the boxed set . detail and clarity is remarkable and puts the previously issued " best of " pair to shame . this is the only place to get their singles from their first in 1970 " nobody " to their last ( when this compilation was put togetherin 2001 ) " dangerous " released in 1991.
camera neg 937.txt i ordered this mic after having to return the ecmhs1 ( because it was , in reality , totally non-directional ) . well , this one actually is directional , but it is such a pain to use i wish i never bought it . 1st of all , you should know this mic does not work with the " smart shoe " available on most sony camcorders - this means it will not receive any power from or transfer sound data to the camcorder through the shoe . therefore it is battery powered . this may seem like a minor problem , but it means you need to remember to turn it on and off each time you video , otherwise you will have either a soundless video or a dead battery . believe me , at some point you will forget this . not being smart shoe compatible also means you have to plug the mic into a jack on the camcorder - this can be a real hassle if you have a small device and are trying to loop the cord around so it is n't in the way . ( in my case the jack is under a rather cheap plastic cover that threatens to break off with repeated use . ) ( as you might expect , i highly recommend you check whether a mic is smart shoe compatible . of course , that means the mic does n't need a battery or audio plug - not that it will simply fit into the shoe . it 's a great feature . ) finally , while the engineers at sony have done some amazing things over the years , they were n't able to do even a half-decent job designing the cap that covers this mic 's battery . this cap will fall off with even the slightest touch . this can be incredibly annoying . mine fell off several times - fortunately i always managed to find it . i finally put a piece of duct tape on to secure it ( does n't look great , but at least the color matches ) . considering the high cost , this mic is a really bad investment . while the non-directional mics in most camcorders are pretty pathetic , this is a very poor substitute .

( & i actually enjoyed the original santa clause , so i ca n't blame the boredom factor on the fact that this is supposed to be a kids ' movie ... ) fourth , i found the christmas council to be extremely offensive ( read : inappropriately pagan for a movie that is ostensibly about christmas ) . *****whoop ! whoop ! whoop ! *****spoiler alert ! spoiler alert ! *****read no farther if you have n't already seen the movie ! ***** fifth , i found jack frost 's conversion to be ... zzzzzzzzzzz whazzat ? oof . i must have dozed off for a minute . sorry . now what was i saying ? oh yeah . poor , pitiful , evil jack frost .

software neg 16.txt the only redeeming quality about this gps system is that it 's cheap . i used it on a 1 , 000 mile trip on the east coast the week after i got it . the navigation is poor . i found that i often had to look over to the laptop screen because i was " off route " so often due to the poor maps . the system repeated the same annoying problems that i see in other feedback . 1 ) the unit would show me being off the road even though i was on an interstate . in this case it would continually recalculate the route and diretc me to take exits to get off the highway and circle around . 2 ) it directed me to make turns onto one-way streets in the wrong direction . 3 ) it could not locate a poi that turned out to be a few hundred yards away 4 ) it often did not know the correct side of the road for my destination 5 ) it does n't provide a chime when it 's time for a turn . it will tell you the turn is a half-mile ahead , but that might be the last time you hear an instruction . 6 ) in one case , it got me to my destination ( at least close enough ) but could n't guide me back to my starting point . the gps receiver seemed to acquire and hold the satellite signal well . but the maps are poor , as is the verbal instruction - it sounds like a 1980 's computer generated voice . if you 're looking for a trustworthy guide in unfamiliar areas - this is n't it . this is going back asap .
dvd pos 241.txt " harry potter and the chamber of secrets " , the second harry potter film in the series , was the first bit of the harry potter phenomenon i was every exposed to . i 'd kind of avoided the boy wizard before then , but after seeing it those couple of years ago , even though i did n't entirely follow what was what and who was who , i realized it was pretty entertaining . after reading the second book recently , i picked up the dvd and watched it again . the series gets a little darker , like the books do , but unlike the book , i do n't think the jump is as large , which i reckon is a good thing . though i prefer the first film , it 's still good to watch . it 's harry 's ( daniel radcliffe 's ) second year at hogwart 's wizards school , and after a shaky summer , he returns to find himself in the midst of a sinister plot . it seems a certain heir of slytherin has opened the legendary chamber of secrets , loosing a monster that is wandering about petrifing students , literally ! many fingers point to harry , harry 's finger points to malfoy , and ron 's wand.. . well that does n't point at all , as its broken and backfiring . what 's this all got to do with the mysterious trails spiders , haunted toilets , a rogue quidditch bludger and a self-flagellating house elf ? can harry , ron and hermione figure things out ? all the kids are a little bit older and a little bit wiser in this film , plus the boys ' voices are breaking . in some scenes they 're kind of croaky sounding , in other scenes they have their child voice , and in others their voices broken through , not neccesarily in that order . there 's a couple of new kids , ( like colin creevey ) and they are just as well cast as the others . the new adults are well cast too . though not my favorite performance of his career , shakespearean actor kenneth branagh makes an interesting gilderoy lockhart , the vain second year dark arts teacher . he played it a lot more subtley than i expected him to . ex-fast show comedian mark williams plays mr weasley , which i reckon was a great choice . i missed some of the cast from the last film though . you hardly see warwick davis ( who plays professor flitwick ) , let alone hear him say anything , and john cleese 's nearly headless nick , who has a rather significant deathday party in the book , has hardly anything to do here except get petrified . there were other things cut out too , like the catching of the garden gnomes at the weasley's . the fans of the book will feel the absence more than the casual viewers though . personally , i like to think of the harry potter films as illustrations to the books put into motion , rather like the pictures in the world of hogwarts . they give an idea of what the book would look like , an impression . special features include an interview with author j.k. rowling and script writer steve kloves , as well as interviews with all the kids and all the main adult actors . there 's also slick virtual tours through diagon alley , dumbledore 's office and gilderoy lockhart 's classroom ( a tour that turns out to be just as pretentious as he is , complete with gushing praises from the narrator ) . there 's also a couple of games : you can visit the chamber of secrets after answering some harry potter trivia , you can drive the flying car through the forbidden forest ( which i found frustrating but addictive ) . there 's also a trivia game about what spell does what too . unlike the first dvd , you do n't have to beat any games to access the deleted scenes , you 're able to go to them straight from the main menu . just as well , there 's 19 of them , and some of them are pretty significant . notable scenes include harry 's close encounter with the malfoys in the dark magic shop , harry discovering that filch is taking wizard lessons by correspondence . i wish they 'd left some of these scenes in , particularly the ones where harry potter questions his nature , is he a good wizard or a bad wizard . that was some mighty fine character development cut there ! there 's also a gallery of design drawings and a section called " colin creevey 's darkroom " where you can select pictures of various characters , then play them in a slideshow of sorts . apparently there 's a whole stack of stuff in the dvd rom features , but i just could n't get them to work on my laptop 's dvd drive . using interactual player ( the player that many warner brothers films have you install to play their dvds ) , it says there is a script error , and when i tried windows media player 9 and cyberlink powerdvd 4.0 , though it ran the dvd and everything else with it fine , the dvd acted as if it was n't in a dvd rom drive , telling me that if i put the dvd into my pc 's drive i 'd get all these wonderful features . it was in my dvd drive ! aggh ! it is in a dvd drive . maybe its just my type of laptop ( benq dh5100u , 1.5 gigahertz ) . ah well , it looked like it would have been really fun , especially for fans of the series . all in all , its definitely worth a look for harry potter fans , but i would recommend you read the book first

books pos 94.txt one good knight ( 2006 ) is the second fantasy novel in the tales of the five hundred kingdoms series , following the fairy godmother . in the previous volume , alexander and elena organized resistance to the invasion of fleurberg by a dark magician . after the death of the katschei , alexander and elena were wedded , becoming godmother and consort . then an order of champions was established at glass mountain , with alexander as their master , and elena was given charge of fleurberg in addition to her other kingdoms . in this novel , princess andromeda of acadia is nineteen years old , but is still considered a child by her mother , queen cassiopeia , and chief advisor solon adacritus . she writes a report on the merchants for a trade conference and impresses both the queen and the chief advisor . after that , her mother orders redecoration of the princess wing , appoints two ladies to design her wardrobe and jewelry , and assigns a steward to handle her affairs . andromeda is quite overwhelmed by this attention and augments her studies to further impress her mother . she notices that income from wrecked ships has grown due to an increase in the number and severity of storms . her studies and inquiries suggest that this increase is probably due to the manipulations of a great wizard . she reports this matter to her mother . afterward , andromeda is resting high up in a tree within the palace garden when she notices a strange flying creature . as it comes toward her , she recognizes that it is a dragon . then it reaches the palace and she observes that it is a very large dragon . it flames some high architectural features , grabs a couple of animals and flies away . the panic within the palace is phenomenal and the subsequent meeting of the queen 's advisors is very lively . andromeda has quickly reviewed the literature on dragons - - consisting mainly of myths and legends - - and reports to the advisors that the only known method of managing a dragon is the sacrifice of virginal maidens . the ensuing discussion is even livelier , mostly concerning the means of choosing such sacrifices . queen cassiopeia states that the only fair way to select sacrifices is by a lottery . after the spate of crazy volunteers dies down , a lottery is organized . some women find ways to disqualify themselves , but others are taken by the dragon . rumors begin spreading that anyone who speaks out against the queen is more likely to have a family member selected for the sacrifice . but then andromeda is selected . this novel is mostly about the influence of the tradition within the five hundred kingdoms . andromeda 's knowledge of the tradition comes in handy at various points in this quest . the queen has sent to glass mountain for a champion to fight the dragon , but the good knight does n't come forward as expected . someone has erected a magical barrier at the border to keep out such warriors . however , andromeda is sort of saved by a champion at the sacrificial site . andromeda convinces the knight to take her along as a guide and finally proves to the champion that she can be a help rather than a hindrance . they travel cross-country in the same direction that the dragon had flown , stopping for supplies here and there , and finally enter the wyrding lands . they encounter unicorns and a fox along the way before meeting the dragon and his brother . then andromeda learns that all is not as it seems . andromeda is nineteen and naive . then she is faced with one of the most difficult of issues : does her mother love her . while many events occur in this plot , this one issue is the crux of the story . even her interspecies romance with the younger dragon is only a temporary relief from this main concern . highly recommended for lackey fans and for anyone else who enjoys tales of adventure , betrayal and romance . -arthur w . jordi

" ) and then complete the sentence with whatever comes to mind . for some unexplained reason each sentence requires its own sheet of paper ; and there are a lot of them , so be prepared to go through a lot of paper . sure , completing sentences technically counts as an " action " . but if you 're like me , " action-oriented " implies some sort of cognitive-behavioral therapy that gives you exercises to go out and do in the world , not sitting alone and writing out your thoughts . for someone with social anxiety the last thing i needed was more solitary introspection . branden gives examples of breakthroughs that his patients had doing sentence completion with him in therapy ; but alas , the practice helped me in no way . your mileage may vary , but i would n't recommend this book to anyone

camera pos 406.txt we canoe / kayak down various rivers and creeks . i wanted a way to take my $1500 camera on the water without fear of damaging it . the sports pack is completely water proof ( up to 7m ) . i 've submersed the case in a test and in a real-life situation and the camera stayed dry . the case does not cause any noticeable reduction in picture quality . it is relatively simple to operate and assemble . you have only the basic functions of the camera while in the case , so you need to change any setting for the camera before putting it in the case and advanced camera features are not able to be used . my only concern is the scratch resistance of the plastic over the lens area . so far i have n't had any problems but i 've only taken on the river for about 30 hrs . all told , i 'm very pleased and if you plan on filming in or near water i would recommend this case
dvd neg 297.txt whoever made this film is obviously trying to impress upon the viewer the idea that artists are deep complex people . but all i see in the film are low life drug addict losers who sit around ( few of them seem to have jobs ) and party all day . the main character ( sid ) is a pseudointellectual who claims she majored in critical theory in college ( ultra liberal nonsense which has the goal of undermining western culture to pave the pathway for marxism ) . the film appeals to naive youth
software neg 686.txt you can try this for free for up to 60 days by registering with microsoft and downloading an evaluation copy . when you 're sure you want it , permanently activate it with the product key you get in your amazon package . the new version of excel has two huge advantages : 1. it removes the old 256 column / 65 , 536 row limitation . you can now have 16 , 384 columns and more than a million rows . 2. excel 2007 can use all the cores / processors in your computer ( or you can restrict it to use only some , so huge background calculations do not tie up your machine ) . on my dual core computer , excel 2007 is **way** faster than 2003 at almost every task . i 've seen no crashes , hangs , or hiccups . but everything else about excel 2007 is frustrating . the new " ribbon " interface is unnecessary and awkward - - almost every operation takes more pointing and clicking than older releases . bypassing the ribbon with the new " quick access toolbar " is problematic because ( bizarrely ) microsoft has deleted many distinctive command icons , leaving them with identical green circles . right now excel 2003 costs more than excel 2007. if the two plusses do n't help you , you may think that 2003 is worth more

books pos 806.txt i first purchased this book when i was a freshman in college seven years ago . it is without a doubt the best and easiest reference guide to writing i have ever read . i love the plastic tabs that mark each section . this guide is easy to read and follow it is organized in basic steps that are categorized accourding to section . so for example if you need to find out how to cite a web page or a video tape , etc using the mla style you just flip to the section called doucmentation clearly marked with a plastic tab . i have since purchased an updated guide for myself and also bought one for my brother - a freshman in college . i really wish i had this book when i was in high school . i highly recommend this book to any high school , college , graduate student or writer . i especially recomend this book for students with learning disabilities , i myself have add and before i got this guide i could not understand how to write a paper in the mla style or in any style other than a book report . i promise this is the easiest reference guide to writing ever published

books pos 135.txt consisting entirely of descriptions of fantastical cities supposedly reported by marco polo to kublai khan , calvino 's fiction is sui generis , a completely original mixture of fable and philosophy that is even more imaginative than his more critical theory-oriented " if on a winter 's night a traveler .

books neg 900.txt the information contained within this book was extremely out of date with a strong emphasis on steroids . it is a shame there are not more current and useful books for pet owner out there on this widespread problem .
books neg 150.txt this book really was n't at all what i was expecting , or what the title would lead one to believe . the subtitle , " in search of grace o'malley and other legendary women of the sea , " makes it sound as if this will be a biographical account of the life of grace o'malley , with supplemental information on other historical female seafarers . not so . the first two chapters are devoted to the famous pirate queen herself , and sjoholm only provides the skimpiest bits of information . i knew almost nothing about grace o'malley going into the book , and i know little more than that now . the other women included are discussed in even sparer detail , and most of them are n't even real historical figures , but legendary story characters and mythological creatures like mermaids . she even talks about pippi longstocking ! not what i was expecting at all.. . " the pirate queen " is actually devoted far more to sjoholm 's travels in search of information on female women of the sea than it is to the information itself . i learned more about sjoholm and her own life than about the women she supposedly set out to study . she describes the inns she stayed at , the weather , the tourists she met , her own childhood , the abundance of " personal bath mats " in northern european hotels.. . almost everything but grace o'malley and her cohorts . in fact , the primary underlying theme in the book seems to be how the author came to the decision to change her last name from wilson to sjoholm ; a story which , to be quite honest , i really could n't care less about . i bought the book hoping to learn about interesting historical figures . it turned out to be a travel memoir , and a comparatively uninteresting one at that . this is a shame , really . sjoholm includes just enough information on the various historical women she mentions - grace o'malley herself , bessie millie , janet forsyth , christian robertson , eliza fraser , isobel gunn , betty mouat , freydis eiriksdottir , skipper thuridur , trouser-beret , alfhild , the " herring lassies , " and numerous mythological characters - to whet my appetite , but then fails to deliver a full , satisfying portrait of any of them . she raises more questions than she answers , and i 'd need to buy numerous additional books to find all the missing information . you may also notice , given the names , that nearly all the women mentioned are northern european in origin . sjoholm entirely omits women seafarers active in other parts of the world , such as the famous pirates anne bonney and mary read who , though from europe , sailed the caribbean . as for sjoholm 's writing style , the book is an easy read , but not a very enjoyable one . sjoholm 's writing is given to an abundance of nearly nauseating metaphors . for example : " the lava fields looked like vanilla cake batter poured over thick jumbles of dates , walnuts , and chocolate chips . in the sun the moss could also look like lemon yogurt spooned generously over granola " ( pg . 222 ) . flowery , gratuitous , and often ridiculous images like this are to be found in almost every paragraph.. . peppered throughout the book like poppyseeds in a muffin , you might say.. . it 's not the worst book i 've ever read , but i do wish i 'd spent my money on something else . it does n't deliver what it promises , and there are plenty of more interesting and informative books out there to pick up instead
dvd pos 254.txt sometimes i wonder how it is we do n't live in a vigilante society . people do such awful things and alot of times the system really ca n't / do n't do anything for the victims . well , in this film , this family was not going to just sit there and let the system dictate how their son 's killer would be dealt with . story takes place in a small town where the strout family is a big deal . you know the family that everyone in the community knows and basically the money makers . there is also the fowler family which also make their way in the town . she is a folk song teacher and the father is a doctor and they have 1 college age son , frank , that is dating an older woman ( marisa tomei ) and she has 2 sons . well , the strout family 's son is married to marisa tomei and is not dealing well with the fact that she is dating the college boy and they are n't even divorced yet . ca n't say that i blame him there , but it is inherent that he is a real prick and probably treated her and their sons poorly . moving along , the strout 's son kills frank and because of the strout 's clout and the fact that the ex wife did n't actually see him fire the shot , he is going to get off with manslaughter . this does not sit well with the fowler's . the fowler 's have a friend that has over 300 acres of land , so you can only imagine what happens . i certainly do n't condone vigilantism , however , i just loved the ending . the strout family put up property and funds to cover his bail , so since it appeared that he jumped bail , they will lose all of that . beautiful ! then , they were able to get some pleasure from the fact that they will never have to see that jerk again roaming the streets . i could n't help but get some satisfaction out of that myself . very real and very interesting . great movie

books neg 802.txt every once in a while i like to pick up a book that is outside the realm of usual reading , and look for a surprise , or spark to keep the fires of imagination from dying out - it is with this mindset i picked up " would n't take nothing for my journey now . " and what did i find as a result of my maverick literary exploration ? ehh.. . ms. angelou may not take anything for her journey , but based on the cover price she will take $17.00 to tell you a bit about it , and even this may not even seem like that bad a deal were it not for the fact that either her journey was bland , her insights wanting or her conclusions misguided - whatever the cause , this book is dreadful . if you are looking for the usual meaningless new age spiritual gobble-gook ; i.e. , about boundaries , respect , finding ones direction , learning what it means to be a women , etc. then this journey is for you - but if you see this nonsense as the nonsense it is , you will be best served my buckling up your shoes and journeying elsewhere
music neg 785.txt in many ways a relic of its era , " not of this earth " is the first widely distributed release by joe satriani ( a previous ep ended up being reissued as part of " time machine " , years later ) . the guitarist , supported by drummer jeff campitelli and percussionist john cuniberti came into public attention when steve vai , a former student of satriani , ended up singing his teacher 's praises in the music press . the result is that this album , more than likely to have been lost in the shuffle of instrumental rock music , received wider recognition and poised satriani to explode into a bonafide celebrity on his next record . the album itself is a bit uneven- - satriani is a flawlessly brilliant guitarist , but as a songwriter , he was n't quite ready . several pieces ( " not of this earth " , " hordes of locusts " ) seem to run out of steam before they end , and a couple ( " the snake " , " driving at night " ) feel like bad ' 80s metal . on the other hand , several pieces shine- - delicate and lovely " rubina " , reggaeish and emotionally soaked " memories " , and the overtly frippesque " new day " are all fine examples of what satriani is capable of . but my favorite is probably " brother john " , where satriani abandons all his effects and performs his delicate and bubbly melody cleantone . in the end , the album is ok , but satriani would go on to do so much more interesting in the future . come back to this one if you 've picked up a bunch of other stuff and are looking for more , but most should start with " surfing with the alien "

software neg 789.txt i have been a microsoft money user for many , many years . ( going back to money ' 98 ? i forget . ) i reluctantly upgraded to money 2007 premium earlier this year from money 2004 when i read somewhere that money 2004 was no longer going to be supported . ( i also read that money 2005 , money 2006 , and money 2007 had issues . hence my reluctance to upgrade . ) for years , i have sync'ed money with my online accounts on nearly a daily basis . i 'm that kind of focused on keeping my eye on my money , and money has historically served me very well in this habit . money 2007 does not . since installing it , i have : 1 ) battled with my prior bank for nearly two months to get them to figure out by money 2007 does not synchronize with their systems . 2 ) installed and reinstalled money 2007 on several different workstations to test the synchronization issue with my years-old money file and new , empty money files . always fails . 3 ) now i have *switched banks* thinking the syncing issue was my bank 's fault . it wasn't . it 's microsoft money 's fault . syncing fails *every* time with a helpful obres 22063 error . oh , yea , that one ! we all know just what that is . i have read every microsoft knowledge base article i can find . i have perused public.microsoft.money and other usenet groups . i have googled . i have read blogs . the only thing i find is that lots of people have this problem with lots of different financial institutions , and microsoft is doing nothing about it in money 2004 , this worked flawlessly nearly every time . why did it break ? ! ? ! ! so if you 're looking to have money synchronize with your accounts online , look elsewhere . but if you 're all about putting everything in manually , this product will serve you just fine . buy a copy of quicken instead !

dvd pos 347.txt this re-telling of the so-called " zoot suit riots " that rocked the los angeles homefront during world war ii gets the facts right , but tells them rather poorly . part of it is the super-stagey presentation , which basically is a filming of the play this was based on ( right down to the shaking props and backdrops ) and which takes little advantage of the possibilities of the film medium . plus , edward james olmos is absolutely insufferable as the uber-symbolic voice of the barrio , although daniel valdez and tyne daly ( ! ) are okay in their respective roles as a young man railroaded by the white establishment for a crime he did not commit , and as the commie agitator who comes to his defense . anyone interested in the time period and in chicano politics may benefit from watching this - - i rented it while doing some reseach on the " pachucho " r&b music scene - - but in dramatic and filmic terms , this is not a first-rate production . it 's hammy and ham-fisted . latter-day star spotting : el teatro campesion veteran robert beltran ( of future " star trek voyager " notoriety ) has a bit role as a modern-day audience member. .

dvd neg 160.txt this could have been one of the best films of the 80's . all of the components are there . ford gives the best acting of his career . the production is elegant and holds up as often breathtaking even by today 's standards . two things however really bring this movie down . the major negative here i believe is polanski 's insistence on starring emmanuelle seigner . this is one of the sexiest women i have ever seen grace a film , but it is the understatement of the year to say that she ca n't act at all . in fact , i think that she might have just about turned in the worst acting performance i have ever seen in this film and it totally destroys ford 's performance . when the film was over i thought about it and came to the conclusion that there is really two halves here . the first half is dynamite ; the second with seigner is a totally different beast , your average stupid kid thriller . watch this film and dare contradict my statement here . get beyond her obvious good looks and tell me she just was not meant for this part . it 's so bad that ford fades into the background in any scene that she was also in . ok , the second negative in this film are these two agents that keep popping up . there is no explanation ever given as to how they knew where ford and seigner would be time and time again . it really ruins what could have been a very nicely done and subtle plot . they were never needed and muddle an otherwise great story . i am really kind of mad with polanski here . he destroyed what could have been one of the better films he has made . and this statement comes from one who worships the ground polanski walks on .

books pos 466.txt seventeen-year-old catherine morland has always been preoccupied with three very important things : dancing , dressing , and reading sensational novels . but doing these things wo n't get you a husband , or acquaint you with other young ladies , such as yourself . so , upon request from a neighbor , catherine is invited to spend some time in bath - a fashionable town , where catherine will have the opportunity to interact with people of her own age and stature , who are not related to her . and that is where the naive catherine meets up with the thorpe family . quickly becoming friends with isabella thorpe , catherine begins spending much of her time with the illustrious , yet conniving family . and it is only when catherine is rescued by henry tilney , along with his charming sister , eleanor , and whisked off to their ancestral home , known only as northanger abbey . there , catherine 's choice of reading material - mysteries and ghost stories , that is - comes back to haunt her ; for northanger abbey is victim to terrible noises in the night - such as creaking , and frightening winds , that leave catherine feeling as if she is residing in a haunted place herself . the fact that the enormous house is filled with various locked doors , and a curious history only heightens young catherine 's suspicions , and makes her question what mystery and secrets are lurking within northanger abbey , and the tilney family , in general . jane austen has been a favorite of mine since i was very young , but it was not until this past weekend that i happened upon northanger abbey while browsing through the bookstore , and decided to purchase it . i will admit that , hands down , this has become one of my favorite austen books . catherine is an enchanting character , whose innocence , and naivete make her charming from beginning to end ; while her overactive imagination leaves the reader chuckling in delight at the many crazy notions she creates within that bright head of hers . catherine 's interactions with isabella thorpe , and the rest of the thorpe family are intrepid , and truly make you feel strong emotion towards those particular characters ; while the charming henry tilney - like mr. darcy - makes you root for a romance to blossom between our dashing businessman , and our young heroine . a wonderful , satirical piece of fiction , that should certainly be discovered by anyone who calls themselves an austen fan . erika sorocco book review columnist for the community bugle newspape

books pos 898.txt this book introduces us to the colorful world of a bygone era , that of border radio . brilliant technicians constructed gargantuan transmitters along the border towns of texas / mexico and beamed their signal into all of north america - one angry resident complained that was all he could get on his radio . these stations were distinguished by their call signs that began with an ' x' . this spawned an industry of singers , politicians , preachers and pitchman the type we now see on & quot ; infomercials&quot ; . mail was the barometer of the day - the more mail you & quot ; pulled&quot ; in from listeners the more clout you carried with stations - & quot ; keep those cards and letters coming ! & quot ; new federal regulations put an end to this wild world but not until the airwaves crackled with everyone from wolfman jack to the rev . ike - & quot ; get out of the ghetto and get into the get-mo ! & quot ; this is a marvelously written treasure trove that will be welcomed by anyone interested in radio , salesmanship , and american sub-cultures and the bizarre

health neg 802.txt i bought this item for my wife exactly four months ago ( 9-15-06 ) and she said it was working well for most of the four months . she had concerns because the electrical cord which attachs to the unit rotates and when it rotated to certain angles , the heat would turn off ( as indicated by the green light which is either off , flickers or solid ) . as she used it , the problem became more and more frequent . now , the unit will not work unless it is at one point and at a certain angle ( which i guess allows electricity to go to the unit ) . i tried taping it to that location but the cord also has to stay at that certain angle which is impossible to maintain when using the iron . this is not very good for such an expensive item which gets alot of twisting and turning use and should have the highest materials and workmanship to prevent electrical . my wife admits that like anyone the unit has been dropped , but that should not cause an electrical cord problem . dropping the iron risks breaking the two flat iron ceramic plates , which are still perfectly intact . the problem is that because of the cord , and the way a flat iron is used , there is alot of cord twisting . for what is advertised as a " professional " device and at a cost which only a professional would normally purchase , we cannot believe that this could be used in a " professional " environment . my wife only uses it six or seven times a week , not six or seven times a day like in a salon . we highly recommend that you stay away from this product .

books pos 874.txt whenever my eczema flared up , my friends would tell me i 'm too stressed out . i did n't feel that way , not much more stressed out than usual , so the timing of the flare ups and the stress level at that time was sometimes confusing . after reading this book , however , i recognized it 's much more than just the simple stress - more deeply rooted issues i 've apparently held for a long time . i had vaguely suspected this may be the case , but did n't know how / where to start . this book gave me the guidance to do that on my own . i agree with 3 other reviewers completely . i no longer feel helpless and scared when i can feel my skin starting to flare up . i am not yet free from eczema , but knowing what may be the underlying cause of it , and how to calm it down , i have much stronger sense of being in control of my skin , body and my life

books neg 451.txt this is definitely not one of my favorite books about stocks . the title of the book is a little deceiving , the author talks a lot about option instead of stocks and half the book is about stock splits . chapters 1-4 are about general info , such as you must buy and sell to make money , do n't hold for a long time . you must research the stock before purchase , eps must increase every year . i did n't find anything in those chapters that i did n't already know . chapters 5-10 is all about stock splits and when to purchase the stock as well as when to sell . once again , the author talks about the obvious ; buy when you hear that stock is splitting and sell after the split before the after split dip . chapter 11 gets into more advanced trading techniques , the bull put spread . this is not something that i use or will use in my trading . chapter 12 is the concluding chapter

ca n't wait for the next wave , and pluto volume 2 !

books neg 877.txt i found it to lean very heavily towards a hierarchal view of the relationship between men and women . men are to rule , and women are to submit to that rule . the authors appear to see women as perpetual children who need to be under the continual domination of men , rather than as adults who deal with men on an adult level . i suggest anyone who reads this books should also read " discovering biblical equality . " it gives another view of how the christians world see the role of women

dvd neg 126.txt the reviewer who called this a disney " bait & switch " hit the nail right on the head ! i , too , remember seeing all these episodes on tv as a kid , then later on disney channel , and was awaiting these to be released on dvd , as i have already purchased the davy crockett and tomorrowland sets and loved them both ; but imagine my overt disappointment when i read the actual details of this slapped together , third rate offering ! i never cared for the elfego baca story , i had been known to go to my room and voluntarily do my homework on sunday nights when these episodes played , but i would have gladly paid the price for this set if it had included all of the " swamp fox " episodes ! above and beyond the fact that i am proud to have francis marion as a distant relative , and that i hail from the same part of our great country as this hero of the revolutionary war , who , with his compatriots , probably contributed as much as george washington , thomas jefferson , or any of the other founding fathers to win us our freedom , i really loved this story just for itself ! not only have i decided not to waste my money on this incomplete set , i have even gone as far as removing it from my " wish list " to save the funds of my family and friends , as well ! i shall wait to see , hopefully , if disney will ever release the entire " swamp fox " story in a complete set , for which i would gladly pay their somewhat exorbitant price
music pos 929.txt this is a difficult album to review . people either embrace it or pass it off as an overproduced , overblown waste of their time . however , i can say that this is my favorite oasis album . why ? that 's a very good question...maybe because be here now was my introduction to oasis , and i could tell that this band had a lot to offer , even through the drug-addled , overproduced songs that seemed to last forever . each one is very catchy and has an overall feel-good quality to it , two characteristics of most oasis songs . it 's no use comparing be here now to morning glory or def . maybe , because it 's in a whole other ballpark . this is oasis going totally over the top and pushing their music to the limit . no doubt that all the coke helped with that . it 's my firm belief that morning glory and def . maybe were and still are great albums in their own rights . be here now is just something else , you either love it or hate it . it has it 's own little oasis category . i can see why it never really lived up to its two famous predecessors . there are some valid complaints about this album , though . one , it is very very overproduced , filled to the top with snarling buzzing guitars and who knows what else . unfortunately , this makes it hard to listen to with earphones for very long . two , the songs are astonishingly long at times . all around the world , while an excellent song , clocks in at around 9:20. i believe that the shortest song is i hope , i think , i know , coming in at 4:23. so you know you 're in for a long , wild ride . however , only oasis could pull this off - making ridiculously long songs that are almost ear-numbing to listen to - and every minute is made enjoyable . all the arrogance , coke , and swagger in these songs is perhaps what makes it so appealing to some people . and of course , there 's that small note on the upper left-hand corner of pages 7 and 8 in the booklet that proclaims : " the beatles are quite good , but oasis is much better . " and so a resounding yes to all of these : overproduced , arrogant , drug-induced , staggering , amazing , excellent . i do n't care about the negative things , though , because that 's what makes be here now a sucess in its own right .

software neg 869.txt do n't buy vista- -any version , yet . ms released it way too early . some examples why : * too many hardware drivers not yet available , i.e. , creative audigy sound cards ; nvidia graphics cards , and linksys wireless network components , just to mention a few . when i contacted product manufacturers , i sensed a ho-hum attitude . moreover , some peripherals are totally incompatible . example : my epson perfection 1650 scanner was rejected by vista , so i was forced to buy a newer model ( epson perfection 4990 photo ) . hmmmm. one wonders whether these sorts of incompatibilities result more by design ( purposely ? ) than from insurmountable technological deficiencies . * too many vista compatible application updates are not yet available . * the " upgrade " versions of ms vista ( versus the " full " versions ) seem to be full of bugs . soon after i installed vista ultimate , i encountered a major problem that ms tech support has been trying to resolve for over two weeks . it is so pervasive that ms outlook 2007 has been affected to the extent that some of its features are not available . it appears that during the installation process , something went awry with " windows event log " and the " event viewer . " furthermore , the latest version ( vista compatible ) of diskeeper 2007 pro will not launch , most likely for the same reason . * it appears ms went way overboard on security features to the extent of paranoia . every time you click on just about anything , a pop-up will appear asking your permission to " allow " it to launch . very annoying , and very unnecessary . it 's as though ms adopted an underlying assumption throughout the development process that the average end user has an iq of about 85. * ms tech support quality has deteriorated substantially . most of the time when you call you will reach someone in india . albeit these people are very polite , they cannot think " outside the box . " nor are they in touch sufficiently enough with the nuances of the english language , thus impairing expeditious understanding on both sides of the conversation . based upon my recent experience with these folks , i sense that a soccer mom could be trained as a ms tech support rep in very little time . what i mean by that is this : during my multiple contacts with them i developed the feeling they rely totally on reading from manuals , scripts , and on-line knowledge bases . in other words , they seem not to be able to analyze and troubleshoot problems independent of external references . * bottom line : do not purchase vista until after service pack 1 is released , or whatever they happen to name their first major fix-it update package . for now , stay with the more reliable xp versions . i truly regret that i had to discover all of this the hard way . it has been very costly in more ways than one .

software pos 830.txt i 've been working with punch as / 4000 since v10.0 was released ( about 12 months ago ) . although i agree in many respects with the positive reviews . for example , there are is a large feature list . however , there are issues with the software . for example : - hard coded limitations in the software design ( e.g. four possible scale options for printing , does not support grid snap smaller than 3 / 8 " or 10mm - which seriously complicates moving things around on a drawing with any degree of precision , very tiny dimension text on windows , etc. ) - inaccuracies : i printed a 1:100 scale drawing that came out at 1:94 approximately ; - i could n't fit a scale house drawing on 8.5 x 11 paper , no print preview ; - there are limitations and inconsistencies with dimensions ( i.e. placement , snap to geometry , etc. ) - the powertools seem to be a series of independently developed add on modules that do n't necessarily conform with the application interface ( e.g. precision , look and feel , functionality ) - the elevation editor is very limited . it basically provides a visual representation of the drawing with some editing and texture applications - ca n't differentiate exterior wall treatments independently from the wall surface ( e.g. brick and siding on the same floor ) . - object library is very limited for plumbing fixtures , furniture , windows , etc. common items are n't in the library nor are they easy to find . ( you can create them yourself though ) . - the 3d object editor is ok but not terribly intuitive . - multi-floor buildings get complicated to work with once you add floors or ceilings . - once you add objects , drawings get big and slow very quickly . - import / export is limited in short as / 4000 could use an overhaul , an updated object library , a major upgrade to scale and printing and an overall clean-up to create a more integrated and functional product . also , incorporate user feedback into future releases
dvd pos 144.txt this movie is high in my top 10 off all times list , and is probably the best ' mainstream hollywood ' movie i can think of . i watched it for the 3rd or 4th time and it is just as enjoying , thrilling and suspenseful as it was when i saw it first more than 10 years ago . my 12 years old daughter watched it with me for the first time and enjoyed it just as well . great performance by all cast but especially hanks , paxton and beacon . probably ron howard best film ever
music pos 958.txt ....and secured their musical legacy . the real thing was a solid rock / rap mixture with newly hired mike patton providing vocals . on angel dust , patton had a lot more creative input , providing his wonderful vocal stylings and schizophrenic persona to faith no more . it 's a joyous ride that after a less than stellar performance initially , has become something of a cult classic and favorite among many newer acts - and with good reason . this album is all over the board . land of sunshine reads like a list of fortune cookies ( which is the supposed inspiration ) , while caffeine is an anthem for patton 's drug of choice , and one of fnm 's most energetic recordings . then there is the occaisonal oddball track showing patton 's range and sense of fun , like rv , which is like a melancholic rant from the stereotypical figure you might find living in an rv . not exactly bilboard material , but fun . adding to the record were the internal tensions of the band . jim martin was having creative differences , yet pumps out some of his best work here . tensions may have fueld a more agressive record , and fnm would never sound better than they do on this album . it 's the bands chemistry - both good and bad - that make this album work . commercially , this might have not been the hit the record company wanted , but its legacy can still be heard today and it 's still a great record to crank up for a drive , barely showing its 15 year old age

software pos 803.txt i am a solo family medicine physician and have been using the quickbooks pro series since 2003. at first , i was a little upset with being forced to upgrade my qb pro 2003 , however once i installed the new premium 2006 , i must say i am very pleased . from the beginning , everything has changed just a small bit , however in a very good way . in my past version of qb pro 2003 , i had to toggle between different screens in order to move from deposits to writing checks , etc. in premium 2006 this is no longer the case . a very easy to use and intuitive home page shows everything you need to use . each different tool is one simple click away . i very much like the new enhanced payroll option in that i can now print out my state tax forms along with my federal forms . in the past , it would take an hour or two out of my family time in order to fill in those little boxes and double check each figure with my cpa . now i print out each form and am finished in less than 10 minutes . i would highly recommend this product to any solo or small group practice . the versatility and power found in quickbooks premium allows me to keep track of my finances personally . the added convenience of the payroll services just makes this product an even better buy . yes , there are enough subtle differences between the pro and premium version to justify spending a few extra dollars . i would definitely buy this software title again
music pos 148.txt having read some of the reviews here i just thought i should mention that for those who enjoy punk rock music rather than the sameness of most emo music these days they should definitely check out this band ! while the singer ( conor oberst ) does have that emo voice so familiar to many other bands , he utilises it well and his conviction can be heard throughout ( unlike a band like taking back sunday ) the music is uplifting without being soppy or sentimental , the lyrics are refreshingly different from most punk-politics band and do n't come across as just the singer throwing a badly worded hissy fit . if you want to feel sorry for youself go listen to bright eyes , if you want to do something about it listen to desaparecidos
health pos 41.txt at church today i came upon a man who had partially collapsed . since i 'm a physician , i stopped and offered aid . it turns out that he had a history of heart disease and was having some pretty concerning symptoms . to my dismay , we do not have an aed at our church ( yet ) . we notified 911 , and he was taken for medical care without any problems , but i was a bit worried there for a few minutes . while i 'm trained in bls , that is , at best , a temporizing measure . aeds have a proven ability to diagnose and treat fatal heart rhythms . in my opinion , places of public gathering should consider purchasing one of these devices . i 'll be working with our church to see if we can get one . i would have been a bit more relaxed waiting for ems if i had had one of these today . however , buying an aed is not a cure-all . i have been trained on these , and they are very simple to learn to use . however , i think it would be quite difficult for someone who had never used one use it correctly during the stress of a cardiac arrest . if you are considering buying an aed for home or public use , i strongly suggest reading the section on aeds at the american heart association website . it discusses some of the important preparations to consider before the purchase of such a device . so , while not for everyone , this is one of the few products available that can truly save lives . in the right situation , it is indispensable .

books neg 549.txt one tiresome , heavy-handed simile after another ; agonizing , descriptive detail that unnecessarily prolongs action ; simplistic , trite phrasing and dialogue - - characters constantly express vague but contradictory emotions in the same sentence , an obvious effort by the author to provoke interest or conflict which falls flat ; routine characterization ; a sentence or two slipped in during a scene or an unexpected circumstance placed at the end of a chapter meant to build plot and suspense read as forced and predictable ; proofreading errors ; fragmented , poor sentence structure - - this book is amateurish writing all the way around . i cannot fathom the reasoning for the quality of the professional reviews which this work received . i cannot understand the lack of proper editing . i am an avid reader and approached this book with much enthusiasm , so imagine my disappointment when i was ready to put the book down a couple of pages into the prologue ! in fairness to the author ( and with a hopeful attitude ) , i forced myself through the first 70 or so pages , however with each turning page i found myself reading along just for sport , my mind constantly drifting and more and more incredulous ( and annoyed ) with this juvenile effort . what could have been a fascinating read due to the intriguing premise is instead a colossal waste of time .

music neg 950.txt i had high hopes for this cd . i love norwegian metal , and i love viking stuff so i thought this would be great . i was at least hoping it would be good . what i heard was a bunch of uninspired , mediocre , a dime a dozen metal songs . i mean there is enough good to save it from being a total waste , but not enough to give it even 3 stars . the high points are the fate of norns , the persuit of vikings , and arson . these songs are bad @$$ and fun to listen too . an ancient sign of coming storm 5.5 just mediocre where death seems to dwell 5.5 very repetitive the fate of norns 7 this one is pretty good . it has a repetitive punchy opening riff that gets stuck in your head long after listening to it . the pursuit of vikings 7.5 this is my favorite song from this cd . pretty bad a$$. valkyries ride 5.5 tedious monotony the beheading of a king 5.5 same as valkryies arson 7.5 a bit of a slow starter but it picks up towards the end with some melodic guitar once sealed in blood 5.5 a bit faster than some but still a downer . all in all nothing horrible , and there is some good songs . the music is a little on the simple side which doesnt necasarily make it bad . i like a lot of simpler music like darkthrone and burzum . the problem is that when it comes to simpler stuff i like it to have some really good aptmosphere . that is precisly what is lacking here . i will still listen to it occasionally hoping that it will grow .

dvd neg 13.txt " con express " has lots of action in it , which is great because this hides the poor writing and uninteresting characters . unfortunately , the action is n't enough , and in between stunt pieces and shoot-outs , the audience is tempted to doze off . city heat productions is n't really known for producing films of the highest quality , so usually i go easy on them . if this were a big-budget company producing this , i 'd be inclined to pan it entirely . but i was n't expecting much and got a little more than i bargained for . the action is , for the most part , pretty good but nothing competitive with your usual dumb action movie . flanery and vosloo are perfectly casted , but everyone else seems to stiff to add any more flow to the movie . vosloo especially appears to be enjoying himself as an over-the-top bad guy hijacking a train containing deadly chemicals . the film moves fast and contains shades of better movies like under siege 2 , con air , spy game , and speed . if you liked those , you probably wo n't mind this one too much . just go easy on it

books pos 954.txt a commentary on a book of the bible will generally include the commentator 's outline of the structure of that book . a good outline can greatly enhance one 's understanding of a biblical book , so such outlines are important . rarely , though , do commentators say much about how their outlines are derived . this book , which is based on professor lee 's doctoral dissertation , describes and illustrates a method for outlining the structure of a large section of biblical text . this method , called " conceptual analysis " , is a modern version of form criticism developed by lee 's advisor , rolf knierim . lee describes conceptual analysis as an iterative process , where one begins by dividing a text into smaller units with coherent themes . one then takes a deeper look to determine how the units fit together into an overall structure for the text . finally , the outline is critically evaluated and the steps repeated as needed . lee demonstrates the method on num . 10:11-36:13 , a challenging section of text that has been outlined in several different ways . he divides this section into 36 units , discussing with each one the rationale for his choices . he then argues persuasively that the key unit for the organization of the section is num . 13:1-14:45 , the account of the exploration of the promised land by 12 scouts , the largely negative report the scouts present to the people , and israel 's subsequent rejection of god 's plan to bring them into the promised land . the pivotal events in this unit largely determine the form and content of the rest of the section . conceptual analysis is an attempt to make the outlining of a text into a " scientific " process , with the goal of deriving a structure from a text rather than imposing a structure upon a text . there is no way to completely mechanize such a process , however . some subjectivity is inevitable , and any outline will highlight some features of a text and deemphasize others . in my opinion , one good measure of the value of an outline is the amount of fruit it yields in insight into the text . by this criterion , i believe that lee 's outline of num . 10:11-36:13 earns high marks . his outline helps give satisfying answers to a number of questions about the text , as he explains in the latter stages of the book . it is rare that a dissertation on form critical issues would be interesting to more than a handful of specialists . this book is a notable exception , and i enthusiastically recommend it to all serious students of the book of numbers .

books pos 279.txt david baldacci has a knack for writing fiction that sucks you in and holds you no matter what the story . part of the talent is to introduce interesting characters . this book is no exception . sara evans is a clerk working for a supreme court justice . she is quite close to another clerk ( michael fiske ) who works for a different judge . michael asks sara to marry him but sara really loves michael 's brother john , who sara has only seen once and never officially met . michael comes across an appeal that intrigues him ( to say exactly why would be a spoiler and it is only revealed very late in the book as to exactly what intrigued him ) so much that he pulls it out before it is filed and goes to visit the requestor . that happens to be a rufus harms who is serving a life sentence in an army prison for murdering a girl . when michael goes to see harms , practically all hell breaks loose and harms realizes he is in danger himself and some mysterious evil guys from the prison murder michael . apparently there was some secrets in harms appeal that some powerful unknown men do not want known . michael 's murder is investigated by his brother john ( an ex-cop who is now a defense lawyer for the lowest of the low criminals ) and he enlists the aid of sara who was close to michael and knows some things about michael . sara is instantly in love with john and the more they start investigating the more they put their lives at risk from the unknown powerful men . additionally , the police start to suspect john of the murder of his brother especially when he is named as the sole beneficiary of michael 's life insurance . meanwhile rufus harms has escaped prison from some of those men that tried to kill him . so we have tension throughout to see if rufus will survive as well as john and sara before the evil guys get them . there is a lot of good information about what goes on behind the scenes at the supreme court . a good rea
software pos 633.txt a couple of years ago , we completed the transition over to the mac platform in our household . both my wife and myself have a desktop and a laptop , so leveraging the .mac service to keep our personal configuration settings synchronized across computers has been fantastic . further , with the sharing features that are available , we each have access to view the other person 's address book or calendar . one of the great features of the .mac service is how it is tightly integrated into the operating system . in addition , since the synch services capabilities in the operating system are documented and open , third party programs can write plug-ins that can leverage .mac to propagate settings to different machines . my favorite feature ( and the catalyst for my initial subscription ) is the backup application . as someone who has suffered the inconvenience of crashed hard disk drives far too many times , i wanted a simple , comprehensive , easy-to-use solution that i could use to backup my data to an external hard disk drive on a daily basis . i 've used other mac-specific programs before and none are as easy to use as the backup you get with .mac . the only real critique i have for the .mac service is the amount of space available on the idisk . when services like google mail can offer 2.7gb of space for free ( granted it is supported by advertising ) , it makes the .mac the space available with .mac seem meager . of course , considering a full backup of my data / settings takes up about 8gb of space , i may be outside of the demographic that the .mac service is targeting . however , in this age of digital media ( pictures and movies ) , the amount of disk space people need for their " memories " is only going to go up . but i guess that is why they have external drives and dvd burners

dvd neg 533.txt interestingly , this pro-apartheid film was produced and written by jack abramoff , now famous for pleading guilty to fraud and tax evasion in the course of orchestating the biggest american congressional corruption scandal in a generation . yes the same man who bribed over 60 congressmen and senators , robbed several native american tribes blind , tried to take out life insurance policies on tribal elders with himself as the beneficiary , and called the choctaw tribal council " monkeys " and " troglodytes " , had an interesting earlier career . he was disqualified from the student government election in his beverly hills elementary school for exceeding spending limits . he took over the young republican movement in college with his schoolmates including ralph reed of the christian coalition , and longtime republican insider grover norquist . but more relevant to this movie , well into the 1990 's while actively working in the hollywood film industry he worked both covertly and overtly to support the racist whites only apartheid goverment of the old south africa , and to oppose and discredit nelson mandela and the anc 's struggle for majority rule and racial equality . during this period , he conceived this piece of bizarre propoganda , paid for by the apartheid government in the old south africa , equating the struggle for black liberation in south africa with communism and the soviet union , and openly placing his sympathies with the racist minority afrikkaner government . the hero of the film is based on the many mercenaries , or so called soldiers of fortune , as they are called in their trade magazine which like the makers of this film , were also enthusiastic about private killers being hired to murder activists fighting against apartheid . an amazing historical anomoly , this piece has even more significance in the wake of the currently unfolding scandal which promises to be one of the largest in history , involving bribery , favors , protection of sweatshops ( in us colonies where women are forced into having abortions ) , fraud , the chritian coalition , pitting one tribe against another to essentially steal money from native america , and possibly the gangland style murder of his former business partner , the owner of sun cruises , when he complained about being defrauded in the sale of his cruise line . my advice , buy it used for historical purposes , not new . this guy has made more than enough money off the backs of the american people . let 's not forget how fear of communism was used to justify murder , racial segregation , perversion of the constitution , police state style abuses of civil rights , and many other crimes against humanity . let 's learn the lessons of history and preserve what is good about the usa . let this movie be a record of the power of hollywood to either perpetuate lies that are used to kill and abuse people , or to turn away from evil and tell the truth . let 's make a different legacy this time around

dvd neg 990.txt shekhar kapur 's vision of a.e.w. mason 's the four feathers is well done visually , but unfortunately much of the original story is lost to create a more fast-paced and action-packed plot . while the basic story is kept , many small details seem to have been needlessly changed . for those who do n't know , the four feathers is supposedly about harry feversham , a man enlisted in the army . when harry is informed he will be sent to war in the sudan , he hides this information and quietly resigns from the army to be with his fiancé , ethne . however , life with ethne is soon changed when he receives three white feathers from his army colleagues . explaining to ethne what he has done and that the feathers are a symbol of cowardice do not help harry ; in fact , she tears a feather out of her fan to make four feathers . harry then sets out to regain the lost respect of his friends through helping them , in an ultimate goal to regain the respect of ethne . for the most part , only minor details are changed from the novel to the movie ; for example , the way that harry 's friend , jack durrance goes blind , or the fact that harry disguised himself as a greek , not as an arab . the change that seems most prominent , however , is the fact that in the film , jack durrance knows of harry 's resignation from the beginning . this subverts the whole quest that jack undertakes to find out the truth in the novel . in addition , the entire ` battle ' between the warden of the house of stone of omdurman and harry and abou fatma was created solely for action value in the film . however , despite this addition of action , the movie still seems to drag at points . films are almost never completely accurate when following a novel ; that is why they are only based on them . however , as i 've said , a lot of the changes made seem senseless . i would recommend this film to someone who has not read the book or who does not mind liberal film interpretations of novels , if they have an hour or two to waste . those looking for a movie to keep them on the edge of their seats would be advised to find something else .
software neg 801.txt i bought a new desktop pc installed with vista . it came preinstalled with mcafee 2007. i have been using norton products for years , so i bought a 3 user package of north internet security 2007. for the 60 days of the trial , my computer ran flawlessly . but it was time to install norton as mcafee had run its course . i installed the program last night , which took 45 minutes with the vista update from symantec , required updates , restarts and the full system scan . after this time my computer , which as i said ran flawlessly for 60 days , well now every 60 minutes i get the blue screen of death and a forced restart . i contacted symantec 's customer support only to be greeted with an hour and forty five minutes wait to chat with an analysts ( seems that i was not the only one with norton troubles ) . after all this time , the advice i was given was....uninstall and reinstall ! ! ! ! gee , einstein , i would have never done that already before i wasted my time contacting you . but the symantec analyst was firm that this was the problem . so i took my morning and uninstalled and reinstalled and...the same blue screen of death but now in under an hour of use ! ! ! i 'm uninstalling this virus and buying a mcafee package asap . oh also , during the time my computer was not crashing , it ran slow ! ! it is a 2.8 gig processor with 2 gigs of ram but it ran as if it were a 386 processor with 32 megs of ram . and everything you run , norton needs you to approve its connection...everything . you can allow norton to decide what can and cannot connect so you do not have to click every five second , but then you will not be able to user 1 / 2 of your programs as the geniuses at norton did not include them in their ` safe ' list . i regret buying this and only wish i could give it zero stars ! ! !
software neg 285.txt used norton antivirus the last 3 years . getting product in tax software promotions . no problems until i installed 2007 6 days ago , when my system became really slow and then i was unable to access the internet . since their customer service phone number is not in the user guide but buried in their website , i was thankful my husband 's laptop was available . the first rep became exasperated when his scripted suggestions did not resolve my problem after 1.25 hours and tersely told me he was sending me an email file that would solve my problems . i had identified it was the worm protection causing the problem so i turned that off , accessed the file and ran it . my computer updated twice with no change - if the worm protection was on , i was n't going to be able to access the internet . worked up my patience and called that evening , only to hold for 48 minutes . finally got another native of india who spoke english worse than the first guy . at one point , we were waiting on a restart and i asked her a question about the computer being slower with the 2007 version and she responded , " ok , yes " . long story short , i hung up an hour later with a link for an update to the 2007 product which i was assured would solve the problem and an email address for her manager . during these two calls , the software was uninstalled , reinstalled , and tested and i spent several hours using the online support . i updated the product and it worked for a couple hours . then i was right back where i began , unable to access the internet unless i turned off the worm protection . i started the day with 360 days remaining on my subscription but once i updated , the protection center now says my subscription is expired . when i check my norton account online , it shows i have almost a year remaining before expiration and all their tips to update the proection center have pathetically failed . sent an email to the management address i was given , but of course , have n't heard anything . i am uninstalling this product and will never use norton again .
camera neg 845.txt there is a serious design flaw with this camera and it is even acknowledged on the faq section of the sony website . " if there are dust particles floating in the air , they can be illuminated by the strong light of the flash and sometimes appear in a recorded image as white , round glare spots . this symptom tends to occur in low-light environments when using a compact digital camera due to the close proximity of the flash to the lens assembly . however , this is not a malfunction . " read : your low-light pictures will have spots all over them ! sony does not think this is a problem . it is a design flaw . if you are only going to use this camera in full sun , then it is fantastic but seriously , there are many other cameras out there that do a much better job !

music neg 355.txt cheap trick 's second album is very disappointing to me after the good , but raw , " live in the studio " , 1977-76 recorded cheap trick . almost all of the material here is so watered down that it really comes off way better on the later many live disks they did . after a good start w / " hello there " , a concert favorite for many years , is the only thing here to write home about when one considers how great all the tunes from this overproduced album sounded on the budokan and other live recordings later . tom werman and rick niesen were on a show in 1991 that i had recorded on a tape once and werman , noce a friend of tom petersson 's said , quote : " my three albums with cheap trick got better and better.. . " , to which the ever sarcastic rick nielsen said , " selling , maybe . " not realizing that brother rick was slamming him , werman then continued , " exactly " ... oh boy . we now see why producing cheap trick albums through the years has become like playing russian roulette . it 's not hard to get better than this and five months later the solid , but somewhat oeverrated ' heaven tonight ' came out.. . ( and the guys even bought werman back for dream police . things turned out better when pete comita , then later jon brant joined the band . yep - the best was yet to come - in the ' 80 '

software neg 246.txt i have used ms streets and trips 2005 and 2006 for over a year . it has some map errors that i wish were updated . i read that the delorme street atlas was far superior , so i bought it . it only took one day for me to find a mountain of problems . not only is the mapping way out of date ( many years ) microsoft streets and trips 2006 maps are far more up to date . on many occasions told me to turn the wrong direction on roads even when the road does n't exist in that direction . it does n't even know the name of some very old roads displays.. .

music pos 390.txt with all the recent praise heaped on smile , orange crate art still remains largely under-recognized and under-appreciated . sure , smile was supposed to be this grand copelandesque landscape of america , from plymouth rock to the grand cooley dam . but for my money brian and van dyke parks did it so much better with orange crate art. having written , what everyone unanimously agrees to be the most california of all anthems , fun fun fun , i get around and california girls , brian turns his attention to a california not of hot rods and surf , but of sun drenched valleys rich with citrus and vine . here wilson and parks celebrate and pay homage to the likes of jack london and john steinbeck . and if all this were not enough , we 're treated to my hobo heart , a latter day van dyke parks / michael hazelwood masterpiece . there 's also the lovely palm tree & moon , a dreamy little ode to a moonlit beach , territory not unfamiliar to brian . and summer in monteray is so unabashedly nostalgic it would even make clint eastwood blush . if you have n't become familiar with this so very underated collection yet , you really ca n't call yourself a brian wilson / van dyke parks fan until you give this one a fair shot . you might even find yourself humming sail away or hold back time while in the shower . i know i did
dvd neg 291.txt " rip it off " is not an easy film to watch . in short , it is dull and meanders from plot line to plot line , leaving only the most attentive viewer ( read : myself ) to guess at what was going to happen next . but not in a good way . judging from its drab look and unimaginatively shot scenes , not to mention a script whose dialogue borders on the absurd , it never ceases to amaze me how it managed to attract such well-known and talented personalities as alyson hannigan and jennifer esposito . it begs the question : why did you do this film ? or , on a personal note , why did i buy this film , especially at $22 and change ? frankly , i bought it because of alyson hannigan : she 's gorgeous , obviously intelligent , and the girl can act . individually speaking , she does not disappoint here . it 's obvious that she really did n't want to sleep walk through her role as lexi , and she gives the other actors a lot of material to work with . although the silly musical leitmotifs seem deliberately crafted to undermine her scenes , she is a singularly interesting actor to watch , and her performance simply wants me to see her do more , preferably a more mature and fully fleshed out character in a serious film ( see jennifer aniston in her brave performance in " the good girl . " ) but enough gushing : if ms. hannigan had not been as engaged , i would have trashed her soundly . most everyone else in " rip it off " ( with the possible exception of the fellow who plays sergei with operatic relish ) is more or less " phoning it in " when they do their scenes . this made me lack any kind of sympathy for them in addition to making me sleepy . also , films of such low production value should come with a printed warning of some sort : beware ! do not adjust your screen ; the appearance of the film is inherently bad . " rip it off " and films of its ilk give independent filmmaking a black eye . i 've seen black and white student films with greater intrigue and atmosphere than this turkey . and , contrary to the technical description of the dvd , it is presented in the horror that is full screen , and not widescreen . can you believe people invest money in these films ? ( ahem .
camera neg 760.txt this is the 7th olympus camera i 've owned over the years , from film to digital . i have always been very pleased with olympus cameras and their usual superior optics . this camera , though , is a major disappointment , mainly because even though it can shoot in raw , there is no compatible conversion available yet , leaving you unable to process raw images . this renders the camera worthless at this time for serious pictures as you have no choice but to shoot in jpeg . olympus should have ensured that vendors such as adobe had the necessary information to make the compatible raw conversion plug-ins available before this camera hit the market . there 's no excuse for olympus to not have made sure this was the case , indeed it 's downright irresponsible . having said the above , the camera lens is quite nice , the camera itself operates well . you can take quite good pictures . however , the camera is not suitable for flash pictures in medium to low-light situations as there is significant lag time from the time you press the shutter to the picture actually being taken- -- -if you 're taking pictures of people , they will have moved by the time the picture is taken . the battery life is very good . the camera fits nicely in your palm . and , having a 28 - 500 mm lens is great . if you do n't shoot in raw and you do n't depend on flash photography , the camera is worth a look . otherwise , look at other products at this time

books pos 582.txt why read a book from 1857 which flopped so badly as commercial literature that melville stopped writing and ended his career as a customs official ? because this book masterfully explores the entire nature of trust , confidence and cons . though the setting is a riverboat on the mississippi river just before the u.s. exploded into civil war , its insights cross cultural boundaries . this is not an easy book to read for several reasons . first , it is undoubtedly one of the first " post-modern " novels which breaks from traditional narrative storytelling . ( another example : dostoevsky 's notes from the underground . ) the confidence-man is a collection of 45 conversations between various people on the riverboat- -beggars , absurdly dressed frontiersmen , sickly misers , shysters , patent medicine hucksters , veterans ( of the mexican-american war ) and the " hero " in the latter part of the book , the cosmopolitan . in typical melville fashion , you also get asides- -directly to the reader , in several cases , as if melville felt the need to address issues of fiction outside the actual form of his novel . the lack of structure , action and conclusion make this a post-modern type book , but if you read each conversation as a separate story , then it starts to make more sense . for what ties the book together is not a story but a theme : the nature of trust and confidence . in a very sly way , melville shows how a variety of cons are worked , as the absolutely distrustful are slowly but surely convinced to do exactly what they vowed not to do : buy the " herbal " patent medicine , buy shares in a bogus stock venture , or donate cash to a suspect " charity . " in other chapters , it seems like the con artist is either stopped in his tracks or is conned himself . since the book is mostly conversations , we are left to our own conclusions ; there is no authorial voice wrapping up each chapter with a neatly stated ending . this elliptical structure conveys the ambiguous nature of trust ; we do n't want to be taken , but confidence is also necessary for any business to be transacted . to trust no one is to be entirely isolated . melville also raises the question : is it always a bad thing to be conned ? the sickly man seems to be improved by his purchase of the worthless herbal remedy , and the donor conned out of his cash for the bogus charity also seems to feel better about himself and life . the ornery frontiersman who 's been conned by lazy helpers softens up enough to trust the smooth-talking employment agency owner . is that a terrible thing , to trust despite a history of being burned ? the ambuiguous nature of the bonds of trust is also explored . we think the cosmopolitan is a con-man , but when he convinces a fellow passenger to part with a heavy sum , he returns it , just to prove a point . is that a continuance of the con , or is he actually trustworthy ? the book is also an exploration of a peculiarly american task : sorting out who to trust in a multicultural non-traditional society of highly diverse and highly mobile citizens . in a traditional society , things operate in rote ways ; young people follow in their parents ' traditional roles , money is made and lent according to unchanging standards , and faith / tradition guides transactions such as marriage and business along well-worn pathways . but in america , none of this structure is available . even in melville 's day , america was a polyglot culture on the move ; you had to decide who to trust based on their dress , manner and speech / pitch . the con , of course , works on precisely this necessity to rely on one 's senses and rationality rather than a traditional network of trusted people and methods . so the con man dresses well and has a good story , and an answer for every doubt . the second reason why melville is hard to read is his long , leisurely , clause upon clause sentences . but the book is also peppered with his sly humor , which sneaks up on you.. . well , just like a good con .

books neg 553.txt ok , i know i 'm going to get hammered for this ; once again , there goes my reviewer rating . but i just have to be honest : this is a terrible story . ok , being that it 's shakespeare , it 's prettily told , but it 's still a horrible story , and i ca n't imagine why otherwise sensible people like it . perhaps they feel that shakespeare is telling it tongue-in-cheek ( it is a comedy , after all ) and poking fun at the system of fathers marrying off their daughters without any concern for whether they want it or not ; that would almost make it tolerable , if i could believe it . but given that it is a shakespearean comedy , we must assume that the ending is supposed to be a " happy " one , and the situation at the end is far from pleasant . or perhaps people believe ( i 've heard this claimed in all seriousness ) that kate has actually " triumphed " at the end , having figured out how to manipulate petruchio so as to get her way subtly and underhandedly . even if this were true , i 'd hardly consider it a " happy " anding , and personally , i see little evidence of it . no , what we actually have here is a story of a strong woman ( some people seem to like it simply because there is a strong woman to be found in it ) being married against her will to a scheming golddigger who " tames " her by blatent if indirect spousal abuse ( he does n't beat her , simply starves her and sleep-deprives her , as well as forcing her to wear muddy rags until she behaves exactly as he wants , up to and including winning him a bet by lecturing her contemporaries on their duties as obedient wives . her spirit may or may not be broken , depending on how the part is played , but the fact remains that she 's forced to behave as if it is , and that 's not a message that should be bruited about in a " comedy " . this is absolutely the worst of shakespeare 's plays

software pos 851.txt i bought this package because i wanted good , high-compression universally accessible documents and images for my personal web page . ( google werbos ) . finally , after zillions of googles on compression technology and trying many other things ( see my other reviews ) , i found something that really , really works well , in a highly flexible and controllable way ! what a relief ! much better than acrobat 6.0 , and other packages i have tried and reviewed . the key capability lies in the " save as " command , which includes " optimized pdf " as one of the file types . the " settings " there gives you the power to choose jbig2 and jpeg2000 compression , the very best formats for black and white or color scanned images or papers . and of course , as pdf , they are easy for anyone to read . an example : two weeks ago , the world 's top empirical nuclear physicist , in japan , sent me a set of 24 1-meg jpegs for a 24-page paper . nothing i had would read it , except microsoft digital image , which let me fix the pages and crop them ; in adobe 6.0 , they ended up being a readable 14 meg document . no better . i printed it out at work , and scanned in the result at 400 dpi to a good modern copier / scanner . it ended up 5 megabytes . ( the copier was modern and " intelligent " . ) then , at home , in adobe 6 , it would optimize it to pdf version 6 , a nice 2.6 megabyte file . today , i got it to 940 k ( and better quality , to the eye ) in acrobat 8.0 , in a controllable predictable way . i had previously tried many , many other options ( including lots of microsoft programs , all options ) . if i understand what i have seen.. . i could have used acrobat 8.0 directly , without all that printout and scan nonsense ! the direct control in the " save as " command gets rid of the need to do all that . what 's more , i just reduced a 3.5 meg file ( from the best previous material ) to 1.02 megs . ( as best i recall , i used cvision before and only got that file to 1.5-2 megs . acrobat 8.0 seems to be doing much better . ) if you google a lot on compression and comparisons , you will see some small advantage of cvision over older versions of adobe image capture and acrobat . but that 's misleading . in acrobat 6.0 , i could n't get to that better compression . ( maybe if i had a phd in adobe , i could , but i tried hard. . ) . with 8.0 , it was easy . and the results are better than cvision now , so far as i can tell . i certainly see no value at all in the new xps formats microsoft is touting , with vista , now that something so much better is available . one caveat : published benchmarks say that the djvu format may be better yet . i did not consider it , partly because of cost , but more because everyone knows how to get the latest pdf reader but djvu might stop people going to my web page . but if google books popularizes it , i might reconsider djvu . but then again.. . knowing what lies behind djvu. . we might figure out something even better.. . eventually.. . and maybe the future pdf standards will open to that !

camera neg 399.txt bought this as an xmas present to myself - to bring along family photos while on business travel . i 'm now on the 2nd unit ( exchanged directly w / phillips ) , and am still having the same issue with it not reliably working with external ( in my case , sony memory sticks ) . the internal memory is pitiful , and unless you want to resize all the photos you put in it , you are not going to be able to hold very many internally . i 've yet to get the auto on / off feature to work , and while it is perhaps a pc friendly device , it 's certainly not always mac friendly - the controls are cumbersome to work with , and the directions meager . i wanted to be able to carry this in a backpack or carryon bag , the fact that the support stand ca n't be folded tight against the unit makes it difficult to do this - of course , no mention of this in the product description . also no mention that it only supports older memory sticks - no support for the new , ms produo sticks ( and no mention of that in the product descriptions either ) i thought i would get a quality product from phillips , and this certainly looked like it had potential - unfortunately , it 's turned out to be a piece of junk , one i 've been screwing around with for so long that it 's probably not returnable . do n't waste your time and dollars...................... .
dvd pos 113.txt until sam raimi made spider-man , i think we all regarded tim burton 's batman as the best superhero movie ( even though i actually do n't consider batman to be a " superhero " because he has no superpowers ) . burton directed this movie , and did a great job - this movie looks like it takes place in the 1920s , except that society is a lot more technologically advanced than it really was back then . michael keaton is batman / bruce wayne . needless to say , batman is wayne 's alter ego . keaton is magnificent at playing the character 's alter ego . keaton also does a good job playing the character when he 's not in costume . keaton 's bruce wayne is n't as gloomy as christian bale 's was in batman begins , which is n't necessarily a bad thing . but i would say bruce wayne was a little too cheerful for my liking in the schumacher movies . but overall , bale 's bruce wayne is superior to keaton 's because bale has a much more developed character to play . however , keaton plays a better costumed batman than bale . the problem with this movie is that the joker ( jack nicholson ) steals the show - the whole movie revolves around him , so this is n't batman 's movie . this movie should have been called " the joker . " so if you ever wondered why nicholson got a higher billing than keaton , now you know . the thing is , the writers never bothered to give bruce wayne a personality , and they barely scratch the surface of the character 's background - we know practically nothing about wayne . you 'd think the guy that 's batman would n't be so uninteresting , but we 're bored to tears everytime wayne 's onscreen ( and out of costume ) . but when keaton is onscreen in the batman costume , batman seems so menacing and captivating that you enjoy all of his scenes . he plays an even more menacing batman than bale - so i say that keaton does a better batman than bale , but that bale does a better bruce wayne than keaton . but keaton did n't have anything to work with , so it 's not his fault his bruce wayne is so weak . but one of the strengths of keaton 's performance is that if you ever met wayne , he 'd seem like the last guy in the world that could be batman . that 's something kilmer and clooney failed to accomplish , but thankfully bale was able to do it . michael gough is a delight as the old butler alfred . it 's hard to believe gough was a villain in so many horror movies over the years . i assumed michael caine 's alfred would n't compare to gough 's , but i was wrong - they 're both great . pat hingle was really good ( as commissioner gordon ) in this movie . hingle and gough were in all four movies of the original series , and i enjoyed them both in batman returns . but in batman forever i did n't like them nearly as much , and in batman & robin i found their characters annoying as hell . vicki vale 's ( kim basinger ) investigation into bruce wayne 's background is completely uninteresting . but i already knew what she would find out , so maybe that 's why i did n't like those scenes . i also found the vicki character annoying , screaming in terror every three seconds she was onscreen . there 's lots of little things i love in this movie . the sight of batman rising off the ground after the two muggers shoot him , ( and the terrified expression of the gunmen ) with elfman 's dramatic music blaring . the look on napier 's face when he sees the emptied safe . when the guy got fried by the joker 's joy-buzzer ( one of the worst deaths i 've ever seen in a movie ) . when the mimes close in on the press conference and unleash a surprise , and the joker 's speech right before a mob boss dies . the first action news report of the movie . the way " urgent " is written in messy crayon on the parcel . when batman jumps through the skylight ( accompanied by elfman 's music ) . the design of the batmobile - minor changes make the car even cooler in batman returns . when the batmobile speeds toward the batcave ( again , elfman 's music is awesome ) . the grin on the young jack napier . the batmobile attacking the chemical factory . the joker 's facial expressions when he speaks in the microphone right after throwing lots of money to the crowd . when the bat signal is lit - but it 's not as awesome as the first time it 's lit in batman returns , or when it 's lit at the end of mask of the phantasm . and now a few complaints . this movie featured too many songs by prince . after a while , they get unbearably annoying . there were lots of other great ` 80s pop songs that could have ( and should have ) been used in this movie . another thing is the joker seems completely helpless without his goons to back him up . so i found the final showdown at the bell tower a little boring . by the way , you can tell that nicholson 's make-up job would look a lot more realistic in this day and age of filmmaking . burton 's batwing is cooler than schumacher 's batwing ( but not as cool as the one in mask of the phantasm ) . anyway , the targeting system of burton 's batwing seems a little screwed up - batman has a big red target locked on the joker , but the plane 's missiles and machine guns miss their target . and the joker did n't even try to get out of the way ! looks like batman paid the price of designing his own weapon systems . i always overlooked this movie 's flaws ( until i saw batman begins ) for two reasons . first of all , i found keaton 's batman to be so cool and the joker to be so entertaining that i absolutely loved this movie . second of all , the poor quality of the sequels make this movie seem a lot better than it really is . pretty much everytime the joker or the batman are n't onscreen , the movie is boring . but i must say that batman was even cooler in batman returns than he was in this movie - and nastier .

books neg 611.txt as i sat here writting this review my rating dropped from a three star rating to a two star rating , and i now realize that all of my malice and discontent could have easily been diverted if the book were titled " drawing people : a technical guide for beginners " and mentioned nary a word about the clothed figure . then if i had of stumbled upon this book it would have been an added bonus that the author took the time to outline some basics on clothing and drappery , instead of a full out disappointment . not that i blame the author solely , most of the blame lies at my door . i was so overjoyed in finding a book that proclaimed it was specifically about drawing the clothed figure , brune hogath 's book aside ( another devastating disappointment ) , and that it was written by a professor from the academy of art , a school that i am still deciding on attending , that instead of going my normal route ( ordering the book through the store , checking it out in person , and then ordering it online so i could get a fatty discount ) i impulsively bought the book , only reading the book synopsis and barely glancing over the customer reviews ( which all looked favorable ) . now i realise my folly , and am yet determining whether i 'll pay for it ( i.e. keep the book ) . i guess what all of my harping boils down to is the lack of content instead of the quality , for i can easily discern bradley is an excellent artist with years of knowledge garnered from experience , and i 'd say that experience shows equally in all areas , not just clothing but in setting up a composition and following through . the problem is , at least in my opinion , that this book is supposed to specifically address clothing , and it does n't for the most part . roughly one fourth of the book pertains to clothing , the other three fourths talk about : how to properly hold your drawing implement , how to properly position yourself if you are drawing from a live modle , maintaing a daily sketchbook , researching your subject matter , the relationships between the head neck and shoulders , drawing hands , drawing feet , drawing eyes , and a whole slew of other . . .i would n't say irrelavent , because they are relavent , but not neccessarily the most important topics pertaining to drawing the clothed figure . a refernce guide on clothing should discuss a plethora of clothing materials , and bradley does on one page with chicken scratch detailing . it should outline some of the rules when dealing with how clothes tend to fit people of varying body tips , again something bradley discusses on one single page . the differnce between water logged clothing and dry clothing , she did n't bother mentioning that . how pants typically bunch up while you 're walking seen from the head on , profile , three quaters , and back view , another topic she failed to mention . some examples of evening / formal attire vs. day clothes , how clothing reacts when the subject is in motion , how jackets restrain your actions and bunch up , the effect of wearing multiple layers at once , achieving that perfect windswept look , and all manner of other topics that should appear in an artistic clothing refernce guide . maybe i 'm being too harsh on bradley , after all she does mention in her preface that there are n't a whole lot of books pertain to drawing the clothed figure , and compared to the standard " how to . . . " books she 's leaps and bounds ahead of the rest . oh yeah , that 's another thing , she does n't outline any steps on how to achieve a realistic rendering like - first start out with a cone pointing upward then draw a sphere at the bottom / base . the sphere represents the weight of the gathered cloth so the stress lines originate from the tip of the cone and travel down the length eventually enveloping the sphere . note the ripples . -or some junk like that . back to me not being to harsh on bradley , i guess in reading she is / was a professor in the arts i thought she would have some understanding of the common impediments modern day artist face when depicting clothing . for all who have read this drawn out rant , two maybe three people , and think i 'm all talk , trust me if i had the skills i 'd come up with my own series of " how to draw . . . " books and address all of my issues . as is i 'm pretty good at drawing dynamic figures , but the second i add clothing they become flat , lifeless caricatures and i do n't see this book as alleviating my shortcomings much . as is my own artistic habits ( drawing from magazines , online pics , and occasionally stepping outside of my cave to draw people in motion ) are a match for the few helpful hints in this book . you 're better off doing what you 've always done plus artistically drapping to a wall or over a piece of furniture from time to time then buying this book . if you do know of a book that addresses even half of the afore mentioned topics , if you could write a review mentioning them , somehow recommend them to me or whatever i 'd be eternally in your debt

dvd neg 713.txt compared to argento , i must say that mario bava is for me entirely overrated . he might be a pioneer , but as a stylist he is sadly lacking . his seventies work is more often than not tiresome and tawdry , even if you like horror films . argento fans seeking out ' shock ' on the strength of daria nicolodi 's starring role , music by two members of goblin ( under the nom-de-plume ' a.libra ) and srgento 's supposed giallio-based debt to bava should buy ' shock ' with caution . although it is an authentic slice of eurohorror and better than the contemporary garbage horror hollywood churns out , it is still a fairly dreary , dull , repetitive flick with few high points and many annoyances . finally , the sound and picture quality are fairly poor even when compared to some of jess franco 's rubbish ( and that 's saying something ) - my dvd of the silly ' she killed in ecstasy ' , filmed years before this looks and sounds far far better . shame daria never made films without argento that are better than this. .

dvd neg 410.txt this movie would get 5 stars if it were not carressing with one hand - portraying the gospel of john beautifully through the movie - and slapping yahushua / jesus and serious scholars in the face with the other hand . the so-called " scholarly " comments , for example about how the gospel was written 200 years after the events , are by and large intellectually dishonest and quite simply inaccurate . even the lowliest of bible scholars , if honest , will realize this . it is very sad to see people making a buck off the bible , while trying to tear it down at the same time . the worst examples of scripture put downs are in the 3rd dvd . i gave the movie to a relative without that add on

dvd pos 935.txt this dvd is a great complement to the dvd 's offered by vce ( trinity and beyond , nukes in space , etc ) . by itself , it is a highly technical look at the process of testing materials , military equipment , and building materials during three atomic test series covered on the dvd set . the quality of the film varies between the three discs . the last civil defense video on disc 2 suffers a lot of audio warble , unfortunately . but , it is nice to see these important historical documents preserved in a digital format . i 've owned trinity and beyond for several years , and i really enjoy the way it is presented . but , it has to cover so many tests in a short amount of time that it skims over a lot of information about testing procedures , etc. you begin to get the impression that the military was doing these tests for their own amusement . after watching this dvd , i have a much better understanding of the entire process . it 's easy to see why the military was eager to do so many tests in the early days of the atomic weapons program . the science of the atomic bomb was a moving target , and this dvd outlines the research they made . though i would never like to see anyone use atomic weapons ever again , their sheer power is fascinating , beautiful , and frightening at the same time . if you are interested in the science of atomic testing , you should really take a look at this set

books pos 147.txt ` the savory way ' is an early ( 1990 ) book from leading vegetarian cookbook author , deborah madison so , as ms. madison has a new book on the way , i thought it was high time for me to catch up with her body of work so i can give an informed review of how her new volume fits into her other books . ms. madison is a former colleague of alice waters and lindsey shere at chez panisse who specializes in a very general way , like mollie katzen and madhur jaffrey , on dishes that fit into a vegetarian lifestyle . note that the term ` vegetarian ' , especially as used by these three authors , is extremely misleading , as it is much more appropriate to say that they construct meals of everything under the sun except meat , fowl , fin fish and shell fish . both madison and jaffrey make extensive use of milk , cheese , yoghurt , and eggs . madison 's objective in this book is , in fact , to cover as broad as possible a survey of what can be done without using animal flesh . the book 's title may be a bit misleading to some foodies in that ` savory ' is often one of the words used to divide dishes in two great groups of ` savory ' and ` sweet' . this book in fact includes two rather long chapters on sweets . a first look at this book shows lots of headnotes to the many recipes . the first thing you need to know if you are put off by ` chatty ' recipe books is that these notes are almost exclusively devoted to an understanding of the cooking involved with the recipe and how to get the best results from your ingredients . while little stories about the historical provenance of a recipe may interest many , including myself , that is not what this book is about . on top of this , i firmly agree with the blurbed opinion from mollie katzen who compliments both her cuisine and her writing . almost all professional culinary writers are pretty good , or have an excellent copy editor at work on their prose , but ms. madison is a food service professional who writes very well . i often wish the soon to be beknighted jamie oliver had a bit more talent with words , as i find his books so comforting in spite of the heavy contribution from his editors . the very first attraction of the book is its table of contents , which lists every single recipe title in the front of the book . this is doubly useful in that this relatively long book divides recipes into chapters covering eleven different types of dishes suitable for just about any time of the day , including a good selection of recipes very good for breakfast . the eleven recipe chapters are : quick bites with 40 pages of recipes for sandwiches , toasts , and spreads . salads to start or make a meal with 42 pages soups and stews with 50 pages of thick , thin , and pureed soups , including a new one with my favorite fall ingredient , chestnuts . eighteen quick pasta dishes for five and company , 32 pages stovetop vegetables , 27 pages of sautes and braises . baked and roasted vegetables , 25 pages with ratatouille , gratins , tians , and other goodies . grilled vegetables and their sauces , 11 pages with two to six sauces per grilled dish . down to earth , 26 pages on rice , potatoes and beans ( although beans appear throughout all chapters ! ) morning foods for day and night , 26 pages of eggs and cheese and cereals and breads . finishing touches , 31 pages of sauces , salsas , condiments , dressings , pastes , and you name it . desserts , 45 pages on fruit dishes , cream cheeses , pastries , and custards sweetmeats , 12 pages on sweet pastes , peels , syrups , dried fruits , and other dessert dressings . every recipe i examined is relatively simple to prepare with fewer expensive or rare ingredients than you may find with jaffrey or jack bishop , and great tips on understanding the recipes and the ingredients . the appendix is just right for the occasional home cook who is lost in the forest of equipment you can find in a first rate kitchen supply store such as the second floor at zabars . ms. madison puts it all in perspective by highlighting all my favorite tools such as gratin and tian pots , the mortar and pestle , a few good knives , the food mill and the pizza stone and peel . the chapter on the pantry has lots for the novice and a few good tips for the foodie , such as the fact that mexican olive oils can be very spicy . possibly the best items in the appendix are the lists of dishes for special purposes such as entertaining , feeding large groups , and fitting into a low fat diet ( note that for the number of recipes in this book , this low fat list is surprisingly short ) . the list of sources is short with no internet sites provided , but i recognize that virtually all of these vendors are still in business . the bibliography is also brief , but hits all the right titles , especially joy larkcom 's excellent ` the salad garden' . this book is a great resource for ` liberal ' vegetarians who simply eschew meat . i would add this to madhur jaffrey 's ` world vegetarian ' , peter berley 's ` the modern vegetarian kitchen ' , and jack bishop 's ` the complete italian vegetarian ' to create a great core vegetarian library . i cannot at this time compare this to ms. madison 's other books , as this is the first i have read , although i sense many of her more recent books have a narrower scope , focusing on vegetable dishes . i plan to review her other books in the next few days . highly recommended for both vegetarians and foodies in general .

software neg 193.txt acrobat 5 was so buggy that i thought i 'd give adobe a couple of product cycles before upgrading . should have waited longer . there have been improvements in v7 : a better look , better commenting , the ability to add text that actually prints , and far better ocr functionality . but other basic functions are way worse than in v5 : some word documents that were easy to convert to pdf in v5 will not convert in v7 , seems to be something to do with font license issues . installation is a nightmare and repeated re-installation was required to get past system hangs , clashes with standard security software , and endless errors in the automatic update feature . the new product activation makes this even more of a pain because too many re-installations force you to activate by phone . despite my already low expectations of adobe , this product is a disappointment . with acrobat 7 , adobe is , as usual , charging top $ for what any decent company would consider an embarrassing mess even as a beta version .

camera pos 422.txt for years now i have been buying " bargain " cameras with the foolish notion that i did not need a nice one . finally , i got sick of it and bought the exilim ex-z600. this camera is awesome . the screen is huge , the picture quality is great , it is easy to use and is sooo small . overall , a great buy . the one downside is that i can only connect it to my computer using the dock . luckily , i have an sd card reader , so i normally just use that to download my pictures
camera pos 52.txt i already have 2 of the smaller versions for other lenses but wanted to be sure my efs 17-85-mm would be snug as a bug in its own pouch instead of a cheap felt sling thing . well , canon came through again with another of its soft felt line the lp1116. this pouch is thick and has the same firm bottom made of naugahide that protects the inside lens . the cord is strong and silky and does n't open accidently the way a silky cord would . obviously we ca n't throw the pouch around and we have to be careful but it really does the trick and feels good in your hand . the moment i buy another lens , i shall have to buy its matching pouch
music neg 304.txt i never really noticed the soundtrack when watching this show on television but i love the show so was a little surprised when purchasing the album that all the non sound bite tracks are american country music songs . ca n't say i 'm much of a fan of american country music so was just a bit disappointed . i think a great inclusion on this album though is the sound bites from all the leading housewife characters on this show and this alone is worth the price of the cd . was also disappointed that danny elfman 's desperate housewives theme is not a separate track and ridiculously has some hidden track attached to it . the desperate housewives theme goes for 0:44 seconds then you have a break of silence for a while but still on the same track before at 1:01 a terribly sung summary of the tv show mentioning wisteria lane over and over again follows for a minute and twenty seconds . what ligic was there in not making this a separate track ? you would then be able to memory it out on your stereo . i like listening to tv themes and i find this just ruins that track because you need to be near your stereo to press skip after 0:44 seconds . this cd is worth purchasing for the sound bites alone but i guess if you 're just buying it for the theme song you 'll have to wait for some other new tv theme compilation album to get the theme song on its own . this album also comes with an excellent cover insert booklet with lots of great pictures of characters and scenes from the show .

dvd neg 97.txt let me just preface my review with the fact that some of my favorite movies are incredibly slow and even " boring " to my friends . so it is n't the glacial pace of this movie that so bothered me . it is n't the unresolved ending that bothered me . it was n't the violence ( in short bursts . ) it was n't the acting ( the acting was pretty good actually ) . but as a whole this movie was simply a tremendous failure . i did n't care who was sending the tapes and i did n't care what would happen with the main characters . they were unrelatable on just about any level . this movie is the kind where you will see a remotely interesting twist in the plot about 3 / 4 's of the way in and you 'll think , " wow i wonder where the story will go next " . and then it doesn't . that was it . very disappointing . i do n't mind excruciatingly slow films as long as there 's some kinda payoff in the end . i really do n't understand all the acclaim that this movie got . as a " suspense " movie or as an " art " film it fails pretty miserably . the premise was a good idea that went nowhere...slowly . viewer beware .

camera pos 985.txt after reading the reviews here and at [...] on this baby , i was a little cocerned about its low-light and indoor performance . let me be the first to say that my fears were largely unfounded . yes , if you film in very low light , it will darken many colors . but we 're talking 60 lux , which is the roughly equivalent to the light put off from the candles of a birthday cake . just keep the lights on when your kid blows out the candles , and viola ! seriously , i have had absolutely no problems with it filming too dark indoors , outdoors , or even when i film local bands playing in dark bars . the reason i wanted to try this camera was because it is the only flash-based camera that is receiving even mildly positive reviews . i do not want a tape mechanism that will break , nor a fragile hard drive that cannot be used in many film-worthy conditions ( think snow skiing , as the drive mechanism will freeze up on you in very cold weather ) . as i said , i was skeptical when i purchased it , but no more . the videos are far better than any other camcorder i 've owned . my last was a canon zr 50 mini dv , and this camera takes vastly superior videos than that one . the four stars is only because of the mpeg2 format this records to . i have a mac , so editting requires that i convert to dv with streamclip so that imovie can import the movies . mainly , i just do n't edit my home videos so that has n't been a problem . but if would have been nice for it to be an easier option , and it could have been if they encoded to mpeg4 with h264 and mp3 / aac , which appears to be the next standard . if that concerns you , or if you want hd , you might wait until the panasonic sd1 is available because it records in avhdc which is a form of mpeg4. of course , imovie does n't yet support that either , so you may have to wait until ilife 07 to really use it . in parting , i will also mention that the size of this unit is absolutely fabulous . i no longer dread lugging around even my smallish mini dv camera . this thing literally fits in my jacket pocket , so i end up filming a lot more than i did with previous cameras . if you 're looking for small , flash-based , and good quality video , get this camera , you 'll love it

camera pos 202.txt i am thrilled with this lens 's capabilities and the pictures it does . i test shot a corner of a window to determine if it would be good for my insect shots that i like so well . well , it did great as it came but i found that i wanted to have the 1 / 1 capability so i bought the add-on converter and am thrilled to have added both of these necessary items for my set-up . i like nature photography the best and like to use my off summer days for hiking and finding photographs to take in perhaps well-known places but finding unique angles and subjects is what i like to specialize in . this lens will greatly enhance your experience in that ' little world ' we commonly trod over or weed-ate away . i built a diffuser using a ping-pong ball over the flash so the lighting would work better . ( works great , btw ) . as usual , it 's great canon glass that does the trick
camera neg 856.txt if you 're looking to capture " the decisive moment " with the nikon coolpix 8400 , stop- --do not buy this camera ! ! ! for that matter , carefully check any digicam or other camera with which you want to capture " action , " because what you think you see , may not be what the camera has the ability to capture as an image . let me briefly explain where i 'm coming from : i made my living as a field photojournalist for 40 years . by the time i retired out of the business i had probably created something like a million color and b&w film images . i owned and used mostly nikon equipment all those years ( although i sure liked working with leica rangefinder cameras and short focal length lenses ) , starting with the original nikon f slr ( which i still have ) and finishing up with the n90s and probably ten different lenses of varying focal lengths . i like nikon equipment a lot . i decided to begin working with digital images last year . i was attracted to the coolpix 8400 because the " spread " on the zoom lens was the 35mm camera equivalent of 24mm- -85mm . when i worked with film i probably used my 24mm and 105mm nikkors more than any others in my bag , so this little coolpix beauty had just about what i was looking for in one package . let me say that while the problems with the viewfinder and shutter lag make this camera absolutely useless for editorial photojournalism , it is , nevertheless , a marvel of human ingenuity . for many other uses- --such as taking pictures of fire hydrants or cows standing in a pasture ( put another way , things that do n't move ) , it works wonderfully well . seriously , i shot an assignment here in tucson that was essentially architectual in nature . the images can only be described as superb ( if i do say so myself ) . i worked only with the camera and a tripod on the shoot . working inside i simply changed the light balance within the menu on the 8400 ( which you can pretty much do on any digital camera these days ) , did not have to check the scene with a separate exposure meter , etc. point being that with film i often carried a bunch of light balancing filters and sometimes a separate gossen exposure meter and all sorts of lights to shoot an assignment . even then , i 'd sweat blood until i could get the processed film on a light table . of course with digital , i ( you ) do n't have to worry about any of that stuff . one can check the image immediately and know instantly if you 're good to go . alas , the shutter lag on this , and many other digital cameras made these days , is the " downcheck " which makes me unable to recommend the 8400. there is also the delay in the electronic viewfinder to deal with . the combination of shutter and viewfinder lag make it absolutely impossible to capture an image , the precise composition of which lasts only a split-second . i have taken many good pictures of people working , " action " shots and the like , but it was only by taking large numbers of images of any given activity and then retaining the one or two that said what i intended that i achieved my purpose . essentially , my shooting eye ( which is pretty damned good ) had nothing to with it . it 's like a soldier trying to kill an enemy with a machine-gun- --if he fires enough rounds , one of them is going to hit the other guy . marksmanship has nothing to do with it . same-same shooting with electronic viewfinders and shutter lag . if you shoot enough images , statistically you 're probably going to get a good one . but it 's not a very good way to do things . so if you 're looking to capture what henri cartier-bresson ( i 'm not sure i 've spelled his name correctly ) so artfully described as " the decisive moment , " look at a digital single-lens reflexes , or wait for improvements in digicams .
camera neg 609.txt i got this camera when it was rather new . i am not extremely pleased with it . it is not acting this way because it is 2 years old...it was like this when i bought it . -first of all...it has no lens cover so you have to keep it in a camera bag . incase you touch the lens without relizing...all your pictures will be ruined . -it takes for ever to take a picture . you have to wait for like 2 seconds for the picture to be taken . -it eats up batteries like crazy -it takes forever to turn on -if you have the flash setting on autoflash , the camera will still flash in bright sunlight -the pictures are extremly blurry when you print at home -it has no optical zoom ( but the zoom is really the customer 's choice .

books neg 32.txt i 've been following the alex cross series from its beginning , and after reading cat & mouse , i 'm wondering if patterson has taken these characters as far as they can go.. . given the fact that there are 7 or 8 more cross books written subsequently to this one , i can only hope that the series gets better . my complains are similar to those of other reviewers : 1. i 'm getting sick of the perfection of alex cross . the man 's a saintly father , saintly grandson , saintly lover , saintly charity worker , and saintly detective . these traits hooked the reader and made cross an intriguing character , but he 's fast becoming too one-dimensional . 2. the cross / sampson relationship . as if we were n't sick enough of this already . every few chapters , we 're reminded of the man-crush cross and sampson have on each other . sampson is so perfect in cross 's eyes that it becomes tiresome to hear about it every time sampson enters a scene . 3. the cross / christine johnson relationship moves way too fast . one moment christine is still mourning the loss of her husband ( who was viciously murdered 6 months prior in jack & jill ) and freaks out over an innocent dinner date , and the next she and cross are madly in love . no development whatsoever , no line from point a to point b . 4. i 'm not sure patterson could have written the dialogue between cross and his children any more unrealistically . are n't these 7 - and 9-year-old children ? he has more intelligent conversations with his kids than he does with sampson or kyle craig . 5. the entire novel is a series of pseudo-climaxes which are ultimately resolved by plot twists that seemingly arrive from left field . the soneji resolution was anti-climactic at best , and the mr. smith conclusion was unfulfilling

software neg 348.txt i have the same problem that xrayman does . i was wondering if i had a faulty unit since it was an " opened " item and slightly discounted in the store where i bought it . i guess i 'm not the only one who has this problem . my tv is a plasma , for whatever that 's worth . and i too found that the spydertv did not set things correctly . color was much too saturated , and contrast and brightness were not correct . the only thing it did do was correctly choose the color temperature , which i do think is better than what i had it set to , so i 'm now using spydertv 's recommended color temp . but i reset everything else back to the settings i had already achieved by eye . i am going to try it out on an old crt television and see if it works any better on that . my plasma is n't new , and i would recommend that people do not use this product on a new plasma . it requires you to put a bright white square up on your screen for far too long . i had to run through 15 color temperature settings , letting spydertv take a reading on each one , while leaving the bright square up . took at least 7 minutes . that will temporarily burn the square into a new plasma screen . ...and might throw off the remaining measurements that have to be taken

software neg 449.txt having just paid [...] for this product , i expected the word processing component to have at least the basics . wrong . to me , the ability to easily format a business or legal document with " page x of y " at the bottom of the page seems pretty fundamental . well , works 8.5- --unlike other microsoft word processor versions or programs- --does not provide that choice . without this basic a " feature " , you might as well simply use wordpad . i cannot comment on other abilities this program has or does n't have , or , on the spreadsheet or database modules , because i simply do n't want to spend any more time on this . recommendation : go to openoffice.org and get open office for free
software neg 463.txt i bought this product based on independent reviews by consumer and pc magazines . the product 's performance was ok , but customer service was a headache . the serial number on the cd that was shipped to me came up as " invalid " when i tried to install the software . i had to call customer service , who gave me two more serial numbers before the software would accept one as valid . now , one year later i want to upgrade my software to the current version ( to save $$ over a new purchase ) and guess what ? my serial number is invalid and in order to upgrade via the trend site i will have to pay more than what amazon would charge me for a brand new cd . i will most likely switch to zonealarm because of the hassles involved in registering and upgrading this product

software pos 155.txt i have been using microsoft operating systems for a very long time , and , i still say that this is the best system out there , for many reasons . an increasing amount of linux and mac users have made the claim that they are more compatible with programs , and are less vulnerable to virus and hacks . in response to linux users - stay away from linux , linux is free for a reason . it is compatible with very very few programs as it is , and that number will only decrease . for gamers - rarley do i see a linux compatible game . just stay away from this system . for mac users - mac 's also have a lesser amount of compatible programs . fewer and fewer programs can run on them , and like linux , that number will only decrease . the only thing keeping macintosh alive is itunes . which is compatible with windows . besides , when direct x 10 comes out , it will only be available for windows , making macintosh 's un-usable for new games when the next windows os comes out ( microsoft vista ) . the computers are also generally more expensive than windows . btw - you can get viruses on mac 's
software neg 700.txt conceptually this is a great game , especially for a child with visions of being a vet . you ( can theoretically ) learn about animals , their care and health issues . those 2 stars for overall are basically for the concept and little else . unfortunately the general usability of this game , vis- à-vis lousy controls , is quite low . it 's nearly impossible to move the character at times , which results in stressful failure in the game . it crashes . it ca n't remember simple settings like , leave the terribly loud and obnoxious music off . playing this multiple times with my 6 year old always goes from excitement to frustration ( bordering on tears more than once as a bunny gets woefully ill while your character is comically stuck bouncing between the sofa and ottoman ) . once going you can engage your child by " studying " the books you 've bought . also , as you analyze the patients you learn about ailments as well as the treatments . that is all good stuff , but on whole the game is too frustrating to enjoy . one final note , this is the first time i 've ever bothered to review any product .

books neg 656.txt for the most part , the author seems to have pretty good information for the time of the book 's printing , but for anyone who wants to read this book on purely scientific terms , be warned ; there are several places where the book goes awry , for example : the author states that tracks of tyrranosaurus indicate that it was a solitary animal , occasionally hunting in pairs . problem : no tracks of a t . rex have been discovered to date , a decade and a half after the writing . aside from that and a few other points , though , the book is good reading

software pos 158.txt honestly , i do n't know how much more they can improve adobe acrobat . it is an excellent product , and a god-send for electronic file management . i upgraded from version 6.0. the only problem i had with 6.0 is that it seemed terribly slow . this new version seems much brisker . it loads quickly , and files seem to " print " to it much more quickly than version 6.0. i do not utilize the " one-button " feature it provides in ms office and other programs . i try to keep all my programs as non-integrated as possible , because my previous experiences showed that they really , really bog each other down , no matter how much their makers claim they won't . i do n't come close to using all the features of acrobat , but for my needs , it far surpasses anything else i 've tried ( or researched ) . if you 're having problems with version 6.0 , or have an older version that you just want upgraded , i strongly recommend this . however , i do n't foresee ever needing to upgrade acrobat again

music neg 34.txt mcmurtrys new album really disappoints . i am a longtime fan and found the subject matter of the new album slipping out of character with james past work ( as well as somewhat inappropriate and overly cynical ) . while mcmurtry has had past hits that either hearken back to childhood extravaganza ( see the elephant ) or that provide an echo to the way we americans spend our time ( holiday ) , his attempts on childish things came across as an unfortunate mix of trite and depressing . in past attempts mcmurtry was able to find the nuances of the positive and the negative of americana , yet all the remains in the stinging lyrics of this album is the over-used and overheard downside . the thoughtfulness evaporated on this work . like many aging musicians , mcmurtry could not resist the tempation to jump into personal politics to replace the vacuum of meaningful verse . the cliche and empty " we cant make it here " is a meaningless mix of 70s era socialism and the ills of modern era entitlement policies that displays an ignorance of both democracy and personal responsibility . mcmurtry , previously able to frame an issue , seems oblivious that those of different political persuasions could easily fit the same song title to a wholly opposed set of social ills . criticism is not intelligence , and we can only hope that mcmurtry can get on track going forward . perhaps he should shun the " pc crowd " and seek his own space and more thoughtful views of the complex but substantial american scene for his next album
software neg 208.txt i just bought this cd because i am learning haitian creole , and that 's one of the languages that is supposed to be on this cd . when i installed it , i was unable to find anything on the cd in haitian creole , even though it is listed as one of the languages on the case . so it has been a complete waste of money for me , perhaps if i was interested in the other languages i could give it more stars . it also says in the blurb that u can use any of the 16 languages as the source language , but that is not possible either , u can only chooose a few of the languages as your source . i am very disappointed in the false advertising for this product . if anyone can find creole on this cd i would be happy to stand corrected . ps i contacted imsi and they say the cd 's were mislabelled , there is no haitian creole on the cd , despite the fact that it is listed on the cover

books pos 189.txt reinventing the bazaar used real-life examples to make markets understandable to any reader . from pharmaceutical companies to the tokyo fish market , mcmillan brings markets alive right in front of the readers ' eyes . he attempts to demystify the mystery behind markets , and in my opinion , he succeeds . each chapter presents a new market setting which mcmillan uses to illustrate his various points . while the book has an economic undertone , the level of writing is not above the understanding of even a high school student . all terminology is explained not only with words , but with examples , as well . the book was enjoyable , especially if you have little familiarity with various market settings . however , i would encourage anyone to read this book because even the experts on markets will have their knowledge enriched by this book
software pos 318.txt i remember the first time i used wordperfect , and the first time i used microsoft word . i could n't imagine why anyone would choose the vastly inferior word over wordperfect . years passed , and now i find myself using ms word every day . i 'd been ground down by the thousands of word users who 'd picked it up along with powerpoint and excel , and who did n't have enough savvy to know how to convert documents from one format to another . wordperfect _always_ converted msword docs . msword never reciprocated . should n't that have told them which program had a mandate to make the customer 's life that much easier ? with each successive iteration , wordperfect introduced some new innovation , and in the next incarnation , microsoft aped it . it got to the point where users would nod appreciatively at the innovation , then wait the inevitable year-long interval for microsoft to catch up , and then they 'd buy that . well , due to an outrageously fair price point and multiuser license , i tried wordperfect x3 , and it was like coming home . it 's nothing short of amazing . i went out and bought a copy for my parents , and they love it , too . now my brother , an attorney , has asked me to buy him a copy , since so many of the federal prosecutors he works with have wordperfect only , and ca n't seem to open his word files . the more things change , the more they stay the same

books pos 994.txt horror master arthur machen 's crowning achievement , a still shocking compendium of interwoven short horror tales . in late 19th century london , a scientist and an unpublished writer join forces as amateur detectives in an attempt to solve a minor but puzzling mystery which ultimately leads to the discovery of a truly diabolical conspiracy . in the course of their investigations , the two men find themselves repeatedly surrendering their attention to a series of seemingly outlandish tales spun by an assortment of eccentric story tellers . the stories , which all deal with imposture of some kind , are only tangentially related to each other , yet offer the somewhat bumbling sleuths important clues to the mystery at hand . machen builds suspense slowly and methodically , masterfully leading the reader on to a completely unexpected , gruesome climax . comical , tragic , sophisticated , violent , horrific , and even downright disgusting , the three impostors is a classic horror novel of sly deception and wit . the 1995 everyman paperback is the only critical edition of this remarkably rich book released to date , offering a scholarly introduction ( by editor david trotter ) that carefully details machen 's main influences ( chiefly robert louis stevenson ) and themes ( imposture of various kinds , also derived from stevenson ) . a short text summary nicely encapsulates the narrative 's various twists and turns . finally , a section entitled " machen and his critics " provides a welcome offering of mostly contemporaneous critical responses to this remarkable book ; while many of these reviews were laudatory , quite a few passionately outraged quotes reveal just how shocking the three impostors must truly have been in its time

software pos 910.txt my kids ( 6 and 8 ) are learning so much from fritz and chesster 2 ! ! in fact , my 6 year old daughter started winning a few games at their local chess club after graduating to this game ( from fritz and chesster 1 ) . today i decided to play with them ( since they do n't like to play against each other - they 're still working on that " good sportsmanship " thing ) , and i let them team up against me . i was viewing this as an opportunity to help them think ahead , predict moves , and protect their pieces . however , i was the one who learned ! ! they surprised me again and again by reciting strategies ( move your bishops and knights out , save your queen for the real battle , do n't move your pawns willy nilly , break your oponnent 's wall , etc.. . ) they had learned from this game . they also knew the relative value of the pieces , but could see advantages to making uneven swaps sometimes . for example , they shocked me by sacrificing a bishop for a pawn in order to open a hole in my wall , which they later exploited to checkmate my king . this was a strategy that even 1 month ago would have been unthinkable to them . anyway , i defer to other more experienced chess players and computer users who have made specific comments about graphics , dialogue , and strategies . i am sure that at some point , my kids will move beyond this game and what it has to offer . but for now i could n't be happier with the chesster and fritz games ! my kids absolutely love playing the computer games and are really learning to play chess - and not just " computer chess " , but chess that lets them beat other kids at chess club - not to mention me . i think i 'm going to go demand a rematch : )

health pos 991.txt after 3 months use , i 'm buying two more of these for my daughters . the unit is compact , very sturdy , virtually silent , and puts out plenty of mist even on the low setting . the small tank is light and easy to fill , even in a bathroom sink ( many people really have to wrestle with those one gallon tanks ) yet it easilly lasts through an 8 hour work day or nights sleep . the key feature is that it is small and quiet . that means it can be near you on a desk top or night table . having the mist nearer to you and less in the ambient air means less will condense on cold windows ( and cause mildew ) . it also means you can use the low setting which makes the small tank last longer and reduces any risk of vapor droplets settling to the table top . if you want to use the high setting , put the unit on top of a book shelf , dresser or file cabnit to allow a longer path for the mist to settle . this is small and light enough to take on the road to dry hotel rooms . one daughter wants one for her dorm room , which is overheated . the unit is easily moved from bedroom to den or wherever you locate during the day . you would not find this convenient with large ( gallon ) humidifiers . this unit is also inexpensive , at around $30 which is half the cost of many larger models ( so you can get two ) . after using several evaporative humidifiers , i love not spending $6 - $9 a month for paper replacement wicks . overall , i am delighted with the unit . the only criticsm is the blue led is too bright in a dark room . this is easily dimmed by putting a piece of masking or adhesive tape over it . the light is helpful to avoid bumping the unit if you reach for the phone or a tissue in the dark of night . it also lights up the mist so you know there is still water in the chamber . highly recommended .
health neg 63.txt i am a 20 year user of several remington products , but i must admit they missed the mark in improving this shaver . the remington es-1000 utra smooth bump control shaver was designed to replace the original ( bms ) black man 's shaver which was discountinued several years ago . i recently purchased and used the es-1000 and was quite disappointed with its performance . the es-1000 performed so poorly that i had to use my bms that i had purchase 20 years ago to remove facial hair the es-1000 shaver could not and did not remove . the product should be called " ultra poor with a sandpaper finish .

books neg 1000.txt " the burning " was a big letdown after reading bentley little 's masterful book , " dispatch " . i seriously considered that this book might be written by someone else while bentley was ill and could n't write . who knows . i love this guy and ca n't tell you how disappointed i was . while one of the top 5 horror writers working today , bentley little seems to be hit or miss with his stories . i simply just did not enjoy reading this new release . it seemed that he was throwing way too much random horror at the reader and hoping some of it would stick . and , with everything he was trying to do , none of it - not one moment - was scary ! shadow creatures performing random oral sex , creeping fungus , talking voices in the microwave , deformed goblins peering in windows , skeletons climbing out of mud pits , tunnels filled with moving corpses , and a runaway ghost train crashing into the white house was just too silly . it reminded me of his previous work , " the return " , another disappointment containing silly , bizarre , and unrealistic situations . the scenes of horror during the first third of the book were described during the daytime hours and lost its scare value , suspense , and atmospheric quality . the book had many problems that pulled me out of the story . one of those problems was how ridiculous it was that the police would allow a field trip to a tunnel of bodies that had just been discovered earlier that same day . bentley needs to do what he does best , which is to come up with a gimmick , focus everything on that single idea , and continue to build suspense around it using his original and obsessed style of storytelling . it worked with " the store " , " the association " , " the policy " , and " dispatch " , just to name a few . let 's hope he gets back on track with his next book .
music neg 193.txt a lot of people are saying that this album is better than their 1st one . that 's not saying much because their 1st album was terrible . there was only one direction they could go - - up . it 's hard to imagine them doing worse than their first lp . i said this about the young , fly , & flashy album , and the same applies here , so i 'll say it again : when the hottest line on your entire album comes from bow wow , your album is in serious trouble . but let me balance that statement though . this is n't exactly one of those album you buy when you want lyrical gymnastics . this is simple , bass heavy , crunk music . it 's effective in it 's purpose , but it 's totally generic ( the recipe for most party songs ) . and some of these songs are just flat out horrible . " stop callin ' me " is n't only horrible , but it is n't about anything if you 're paying attention to the wack lyrics dfb put on it ( and whoever wrote the hook should be slapped ) . and who 's idea was it to let dame dash ( yeah , that dame dash ) scream all over a song ( bricks 4 the high ) ? i want to know who the guy was that said " yeah , that 's a good idea " . dame is doing what he does best , so he 's not at fault.....i blame the idiot that put him on the song . " suckas come and try me " is probably the worst song to come out of the south since drama dropped his album . and if you ask me , the " white tee " remix was a step backward from the original . it would help if they could talk about something other than " haters " , postin ' up on the block ( i swear they say that on the album at least 100 times ) , rims , jewelry , and weed . but expecting them to change up their sound would be silly on my part i guess . besides , if people buy this , why should they change ? that 's another story though . in short , the album fails to seperate dfb from the pack . the beats are generic and the rhymes are terrible ( " i 'll make you 1 2 step like ciara " ? come on , i could write that in my sleep ) and it 's hard to tell if there are four rappers or just one because they all sound similar . once you understand the purpose of this album though , then you can find a few decent tracks , but do n't go getting your hopes up just yet . there are only 3 or 4 songs worth hearing . " my music " is listenable and dfbs put down some decent lyrics that are helped out by bun b 's good appearance . the best beats on the album are on " do n't play with me " feat . three six mafia and " freaky as she wanna be " . " do n't play with me " features production from dj paul & juicy j , so you know it 's tight . i love three six , so that 's my favorite song on the album . and " freaky as she wanna be " will be the second single off the album if they 're smart . on top of our game is good for what it 's supposed to be good for ( partying and....well , that 's it ) , but not much else . jermaine dupri is trying his best to keep his label relevant , but i do n't know if this approach is gonna help him any . this album is better than their debut , but that 's not really saying much . this should be pretty obvious , but i 'll say it anyway . if you 're into lyrics , then this is n't for you . if you want crunk beats to bounce to , then this is right up your alley . it depends on your preference , but this listener has heard better crunk music and recommends passing on this one . standout tracks : freaky as she wanna be , i think they like me ( remix ) feat . jd , da brat , & bow wow , do n't play wit me feat . three six mafia ( my favorite ) , and my music feat . bun b .

camera neg 64.txt after reading the many good reviews here , i too bought the lenmar battery to act as a second battery for my canon digital camera . i was totally pleased with the excellent performance as many others have noted . the only difference i noticed between the lenmar and oem battery was that with lengthy continuous shooting with the lcd screen on the camera case got significantly hotter with the lenmar battery that with the oem . this was not a problem until i was shooting on a 101 degree day ( with the lenmar battery in ) and suddenly the screen went black . i could view previously taken pictures ( lcd ok ) but any new photo i tried to take was black . i read later in the manual the upper operating temperature of the camera is 104 degrees . once the camera cooled it worked again for a while , but the black photo problem continued intermittenly for a few weeks then the camera completely stopped taking photos , no matter what . so , was it the lenmar battery 's extra heat generation pushing the camera over its temperature limit and damaging the circuitry ? would it have happened if the cooler running oem battery was installed on the hot day ? i ca n't say for sure , but if you use a lenmar battery i would be careful about operating it on a very hot 100 degree day ( e.g. use the viewfinder , not the lcd since that generates heat , or turn the camera off a lot to cool down between shots ) .

dvd neg 54.txt i would n't recommend this movie , unless you have nothing else to do for the night and want to watch it alone . due to a high content of bad words , screaming and violence , it 's kind of embarrassing watching it with someone else . some people really enjoyed it , and that 's not me , and that 's not the other two people i know who watched it . some violent parts are a bit hard to believe , but i guess that 's what the story is about . this movie is a bit of a hollywood-style suspense , with rather cheesy college scenes that are common to comedies . there 's one good idea in this movie and that 's how life develops as it goes along , and one action or inaction changes how life plays out . but this is no where near original , even the simpsons had an episode like that . so , this movie is definitely not on my best movies list .
camera neg 602.txt after doing a bunch of research , i bought two of these for my teenage kids since they were said not to have the defective sony ccd that late model 2005 point-and-shoots all seem to have had . the first zamera lasted six months before the lcd display began to worsening exhibit dark striations . after a few days of that , the camera dies completely . the second camera made it another two months before falling prey to the same disease . one camera . . . a fluke maybe . but two ? that suggests a real problem so beware .

camera neg 464.txt this scope is not a good starter scope for anyone interested in astronomy . here 's why : 1. the objective is too small , only 60 mm , 2.36 inches , so it is too small to bring in the light necessary for even a beginning look at the universe . i suppose it is adequate for the moon , but that is it . the planets will appear as very small disks . one will be able to see saturn 's rings , but the image will be very small . forget it for deep sky objects , clusters , galaxies , etc. 2. the mount is an altazimuth , which will not follow the celestial object in the sky . the earth is rotating , and anyone focusing on a star or moon will quickly find the object drifting out of the field of vision . a better mount is an equatorial mount which makes it much easier to track objects . 3. the 4mm eyepiece is too powerful for this scope . the observer will find it hard to look through ( very small eye opening ) , and will in most cases cause blurred images . the 20 mm eyepiece is the only functional eyepiece . the barlow is a 3x , which again is too poweerful for this scope . 4. the mount will vibrate when touched , which will cause the image in the eyepiece to " shiver " , which is very frustrating . even for the low price , do n't be enticed by this scope ; it has too many flaws . save your money for a larger scope with a better mount . jim " konedog " koenig , astronomy buf
dvd pos 750.txt let 's face it , tinseltown has run out of original story lines . that 's usually when they turn to remakes . i 've seen several remakes over the years , both tv and movie , but this is one of the best remakes i 've seen in quite some time . i really enjoyed how they expanded on the original story line . what a lot of people need to understand is that this movie had nothing to do with the tv show and pulled all of it 's story from the comic book . if you were never into comics to begin with then you ca n't appreciate the story line . another thing that i feel is under appreciated about this movie is the cgi . people have to understand that if they got some body builder and slapped green paint on him than the movie would have been a complete waste of time ! the amount of man hours that went in to creating the cgi is something to be applauded and appreciated , not mocked and thrown out with the trash . you have to appreciate the movie for the story line and its artistic value . most people were upset with this movie because they thought it was too slow and it should have been more fun and had a lot more action in it . the story of the hulk is a sad , depressing , dramatic story ! there is n't anything funny about being zapped with radiation and transforming into a mindless brute evertime you get ticked off about something . the hulk was n't meant to be campy , it was meant to be serious . my only gripe about this movie is that they could have picked a better actress to play banner 's love interest . the little amount of screen time she was given was completely wasted

dvd neg 192.txt as the other reviewers make clear , this is a disturbing film in that the college girl forced into prostitution ends up by developing feelings for the man who " ruined " her . so you may immediately assume that the director has a deeper comment to make beyond this trite observation . problem is , having just watched the movie , i am not convinced there is anything below the surface . prostitution is a fact of life in asian cities , the theme of women overcome by their desires and in thrall to strong men a common one , and i searched in vain for any subversion of or challenge to that fantasy ( as fantasy it is ) . is this any more than a homage to the inutility of futility ? not that i can see

dvd neg 639.txt is larry an actual redneck , or is it all really a joke inside " larry 's " mind ? i sometimes think that dan whitney ( larry 's real name ) knows what he 's doing . i think he is actually making a huge joke out of the rednecks who are totally in love with him . he is openly mocking them , and when they might get a tad uncomfortable , but then he 'll drop a politically incorrect joke into the routine , and they love him again . dan / larry started out as a " normal " comedian ( there 's footage of him on youtube before his larry incarnation ) , and was n't really getting anywhere with that . so he became a redneck , and is a multi-millionare now . but all his redneck fans think of larry as a " regular guy " , despite the fact that larry lives in one of those fancy houses that rednecks think only nycers live in ( for the record , nycers do n't all live in fancy houses . there 's a lot of working class people in nyc who live in regular houses and regular apartments ) . so larry is taking advantage of illiterate , easily amused rednecks . just put on a flannel shirt , fart , wear a confederate flag , and say you hate liberals , then fleece the rednecks ! i do n't think larry really has a redneck mentality ( even though he 's originally from nebraska , so he has some hillbilly cred , so to speak ) . i think he 's just making a ton of money off of easily amused people .

dvd neg 674.txt the film seems to focus on 70 's punk exclusively . anything post-1980 is glossed over , clumped together and generally viewed with dissapointment by this " documentary " . i think the film does well documenting the roots of punk , seeing as how letts was steeped in the scene at that time ( although the misfits were n't mentioned , which i found odd ) . the interviews with henry rollins and jello biafra were great as well . however , in order to claim to be a documentary , the evolution of punk rock is just as integral ( perhaps more so ) as its origins . i think , basically , letts based the film on his own opinions , likes and dislikes instead of actually documenting punk . i was disapointed .
camera pos 84.txt i bought this hood after reading elsewhere that it fits the 50mm f / 1.8 mark i ( the version with the metal mount and distance scale ) that i purchased recently . canon specs the discontinued es-65 hood for this lens . the great thing about this et-65iii is that it is longer , so it blocks more stray light without vignetting on full-frame or 1 / 6-frame slrs . the interior on this mark iii version is also flocked , providing a bit more light absorption . i 've used those collapsible rubber hoods before while in college , but this hood is definitely worth the investment : well built , fits backward on the lens for storage ( but too long while the lens is on the camera ) , and provides good protection for the front of the lens ( it 's quite deep ) . note that this will not fit the newer 50mm f / 1.8 mark ii version ( all plastic mount with no distance scale )
books neg 693.txt ernest hemingway dies on page 161 of this 300-page book and so does author valerie hemingway 's story . for that reason this book merits only two stars . early in her story of meeting hemingway in spain in 1959 at age 19 , valerie is aware of the author 's magnetic and dominant personality , " around him everything came to life....there was an urgency and vitality that...did not ebb . " when she stays focused on the story of ernest hemingway , this is an endearing look at the older , struggling hemingway finding temporary renewal in the freshness of an innocent irish girl who entered his life during the final drafts of " a moveable feast . " but the youthful time spent with the famous writer works against this memoir since she was clearly neither as dedicated a correspondent or note taker as her subject . as a result , her recollections are thin and easily available in other sources such as a . e . hotchner 's " papa hemingway . " the two years she spent living and traveling with hemingway through spain , paris , key west , cuba , and america , share as much space as her weird marriage with hemingway 's strange son , gregory ( apparently the other " bull " referred to in the title ) . it shows the continuing vitality of ernest hemingway - even in death and over 40 years later - that a valerie hemingway can find a book deal for her meager remembrances of such a great man

music neg 940.txt i bought this cd for " hole in the earth " , a very dynamic , driving and quasi-psychedelic rocker , and mostly got what i expected - more of the same along a continuum , sometimes pushing their envelope in either direction , as i expected . and then i came upon " pink cellphone " , a rotten apple if there ever was one . this vile little stinker is as if one of the band 's groupies wandered into the control room in a methamphetamine haze , defecated on the mixing board , and then described her experience , in no uncertain terms , into an answering machine . if there was ever a reason to switch from buying an artist 's complete cds to just purchasing individual tracks off of the web , this is it . congratulations , guys , you have not only lodged a very descriptive and literally filthy image into my head , but convinced me , and i 'd wager , many listeners , that our faith is ill placed with the musical choices that pop musicians make when assembling their " b " sides . to say nothing of the bad taste and lack of respect for your audience that this demonstrates . someone should wash the deftones ' mouths out with a bar of soap - maybe a few bars .

dvd pos 577.txt although tomorrow is yesterday is an okay episode , it is not one to rave about.it is certainly not one of the original series ' best . however , return of the archons is one of the best and one of my favourites.kirk , spock and mccoy investigate a planet where the inhabitants appear to be in a drug-induced state then rapidly change from walking peacefully and amiably along the streets into violent and looting maniacs that seem to lose all inhibitions . a mob attacks kirk and crew and they are forced to defend themselves with their phasers . it seems the planet is run by a man named landru , who advocates peace and tranquility to the extent that you get " absorbed " .a kind of brainwash conditioning into thinking only of harmony and serenity.later it is discovered that landru is a computor projection ; the edict of landru who died 5 , 000 years ago has been continued by a computer i just read a review saying the solution to the landru mystery wo n't surprise anyone , it sure surprised me . i did n't see that one coming
health pos 528.txt i have seen these in catalogs before & did n't give them a second thought . then one day when i was cleaning under & around all of my shampoo bottles , etc in the shower , it hit me that one of these might just consolidate all the shampoos / conditions & body wash that i have collected in my shower . so , i ordered one a higher price & i am so thrilled that i am ordering one for the kids ' bathroom where i had hubby put in an extra shelf just to hold all the shampoos etc. now it will all be in one place , not messy & out of the reach of my toddler ! the other thing that i have noticed is that i do n't use nearly as much shampoo as i did before - i get a few squirts & if that is n't enough , i get more - no more dumping a handfull of shampoo in my hand . i know i use far less shampoo than i did before i had this so i am no longer wasting it ! this is just the greatest concept & this product is very easy to keep clean & it works & looks great in the shower . i would recommend this product to anyone ! & if you do n't think you will fill up all four sections - get a smaller one but i found the 4 section one is just what i needed ; one for clarifying shampoo , one for conditioning shampoo , one for conditioner & one for body wash . no more bars or shampoos cluttering my bathroom
dvd pos 408.txt ohm.. . ohm.. . ohm.. . back in 2000 , ellipsis arts released ohm : the early gurus of electronic music , a fantastic and essential three cd set tracing the evolution of " electronica " from messiaen , cage , and xenakis to schulze , eno , and hassell . this set was recently reissued ( as ohm+ ) along with a bonus dvd , which is thankfully now available separately for those of us who already have the cds . the ohm+ dvd is jam-packed with over two hours of archival and more recent footage that runs the gamut from engrossing to mildly interesting to unwatchably dull . if seemingly endless " talking head " interviews with milton babbitt and bebe barron are your idea of video entertainment , you 've come to the right place . an interview with john cage digitally altered beyond all recognition ? check . swirling psychadelic colored dyes right out of a saucerful of secrets-era pink floyd concert ? no problem . there are some tastier goodies to be found on this dvd , however.. . the segments with clara rockmore and leon theremin have an appealingly amateurish home movie quality to them . it 's also a real treat to see the 1978 footage of underappreciated minimalist guru david borden and mother mallard 's portable masterpiece company " on the road " hauling around their truckload of big old analog synthesizer equipment . laurie spiegel is fun to watch as she tinkers with a big grey metal box called a " concerto generator " with an extremely serious expression on her face . and alvin lucier 's " music for solo performer , " where he hooks up wires to his head and produces sounds using his brainwaves and two tympani , simply must be seen to be believed . the pixar-ish computer animation accompanying paul lansky 's " the dust bunny " is sort of cute , but it goes on for about 10 minutes too long . surely most of the ohm target audience already has the dvd of steve reich 's three tales , but it 's nice that they included the best part - the ominous yet goofy " dolly " segment . many have also probably seen hans fjellestad 's documentary moog before , but the six minute excerpt provided here is really about all you need . it 's too bad there is n't a more interesting john cage segment , and regrettable that there are n't any stockhausen videos ( those would certainly be a riot ! ) overall , though , while the ohm+ dvd is not as consistently engaging as the cd set of the same name , it is a worthy companion to it . and if you do n't have either of them yet , the complete ohm+ 3-cd & dvd " special edition " box set is a no-brainer

" this makes me want to go back and listen to those albums i have missed . one song in particular , " the seedling " ( i believe ) has a different sound than the rest of the album . it has a harsher sound , but is still a good song . this is a great introduction if you are new to oldham or if you are returning listener .
books neg 218.txt this book is very disappointing , as is most of gunaratna 's work on islamist terrorism . it 's the sort of stuff governments and many of the public want to hear , ie . bin laden and aq are everywhere , responsible for every terrorism attack and all regional terorist groups ( such as ji ) are aq franchises - total bollocks . the book lacks solid and verifiable reserach and is written by a " scholar " who spends most of his time doing alarmist media commentary

health neg 11.txt i am a 20 year user of several remington products , but i must admit they missed the mark in improving this shaver . the remington es-1000 utra smooth bump control shaver was designed to replace the original ( bms ) black man 's shaver which was discountinued several years ago . i recently purchased and used the es-1000 and was quite disappointed with its performance . the es-1000 performed so poorly that i had to use my bms that i had purchase 20 years ago to remove facial hair the es-1000 shaver could not and did not remove . the product should be called " ultra poor with a sandpaper finish . " the product needs to be put to death by using an ultra smooth bullet . for anyone with curly hair problems , you may want to consider comparing this product against the wahl 5-star series , model # 8061. i think you will find there is a major difference in the products
health neg 550.txt in my experience with this product , i had no significant hair growth . very disappointing for the amount of money you spend on it , and the amount of pills you have to take daily ( ugh ! ) . however , i gave it a two because while it did n't grow my hair , it did change the texture of it . my natural hair is very coarse , and while using the hf37 it became really soft , silky and manageable . nice , if that 's what you 're looking for a hair vitamin to do . but as far as hair growth...absolutely not recommending hf37 for that
dvd neg 898.txt clearly this movie was never intended as high art , or even a zombie gore fest , although hyped as such , so it ` s probably a bit unfair and easy to take shots at it , however i think it fails on it own terms . *** many spoilers to follow *** stop here if you plan to view the entire film . the premise : a group of stupid eco terrorists raid a research facility in london , even though warned by a researcher , release some highly agitated but otherwise normal looking chimps who then attack and infect them with a fast acting ( within seconds ) virus that transforms them into insane , red-eyed murderous really fast creatures who attack and infect other normal humans through bites and even scratches . one drop of their saliva or blood can infect you . the plague is let lose ... the hero : cut to a skinny kid of about 110 pounds with a dopey beard laying naked on a hospital bed , it ` s 28 days later and he wakes up , but no one 's there . he then wanders around an empty london , in hospital scrubs , looking confused , yelling " hello ! ! " , " hello ! ! " there are no bodies outside , and nothing that looks like the remains of one . there are almost 15 million people in metropolitan london . where did they go i asked myself ? the supporting cast : he then wanders into a church , and finds it full of what looks like sleeping people , he yells " hello ! ! " at which time some start screaming and rush at him , in the close-up it ` s clear they have turned and he slugs the creature-priest thing with his bag of coke cans . he gets out , more stuff happens , eventually he meets smart and tough selena ( naomie harris ) armed with a matchete and mark ( noah huntley ) , armed with a steel bar , who have avoided infection and explain the situation to the dim whitted hero , who turns out to be a bicycle messager boy who lives with mum and dad . seems the creatures come out mostly at night . mostly . hero insists on going home , mark & selena tag along . we find his very middle class mum & dad peacefully dead in bed from an overdose of booze and pills . guess they could not live in a world without telly.. . more talk and moaning and tears from hero who very unwisely lights a candle at night which naturally draws an attack by some nasties , more fighting , bad guys are killed by selena and mark while hero cowers on floor . mark gets infected , denies it , but is chopped by selena who " can see it in his eyes " . damm girl ! if i ` m ever in a zombie movie i want you along ! day 2 comes , the pair then wander aimlessly though london chatting away about everything but how to deal with the threat and survival and at this point i start thinking ; wouldn ` t it be a good idea to get some guns ? preferably full auto , with a lot of ammo . i mean , although the creatures are fast , they are stupid , don ` t run in packs and make a lot of noise and can be killed and stay dead . police stations and military bases are all over london , probably deserted , and filled with guns....but this doesn ` t seem to occur to our wandering charactors who trust to a baseball bat & machette which you must get close to use....emmmm . i start squirming a bit in the seat , and for the first time look at my watch , but it ` s still kind of ok . so far , it ` s still a tight , well made interesting film , with the bloody action well filmed and important to the story line , and mostly believeable in it ` s own low buget post apocolypitcal setting with taut dialoge that holds my interest . maybe there a reason the hero is cast as stupid , or will he grow and learn through experience ? , maybe , but it better be soon because we are almost 30 minitues into the film , and it ` s getting real hard to identify with him . or care . the suporting cast 2 : night falls . our pair see flashing lights on the top of a high rise , much action ensues , they find more survivors , just a average working type dad taxi driver and his young daughter . more talk , seems they are out of water and there is a radio broadcast giving direction to go north where the army ( who usually have guns ) has set up a secure area . works for me . after some debate on whether it better to stay where they are , isolated , in fact trapped on top of a building , with no water or power or food or real weapons until overrun by zombies , or travel north to safety , in daylight and safety ( remember , the monsters don ` t operate in daylight ) this group of dopes reluctantaly decide to go north , in a taxi , with no guns. . ( remember rule # 3 of zombie films : gun are good ) ..and at this point in time this heretofore good film starts to move rapidly downhill in believablity . the journey of the dumb : piling into dad ` s hack , loaded with junk as if going on a brighton holiday , with all , even tough selena giggling and laughing , off they go . when faced with the choice of driving through a dark tunnel , where it is obvious that they could be trapped and killed , or another safer route , they naturally chose the tunnel . stuff happens . stopping to get gas , the hero wanders alone into a dark , confined space for no real reason , armed only with a baseball bat . more stuff happens . stopping for the night , they decide that a picturesque , open field with a few low stones is a great spot and preceed to ......you guessed it ! start a really big fire and go to sleep with no one on guard . i ` m not making this up folks. . ! ! nothing happens . however they do get to see a family of white and black horses running free , and it ` s clear that we are no longer watching a horror / action film , with some internal logic but a trite " message film " . they reach the army blockade , but no one is there , in spite of dead everywhere , they proceed to split up and wander around this perfect ambush site for a look see . more stuff happens . after this , the stupid illogical stuff comes fast so this is a good stopping point . at the end we learn from the crazy and sadistic army major ( aren ` t they all though ) that the goon ` s can ` t farm or feed and will likely starve because of it . think about that one . we also learn that the virus is contact borne , not airborne , think hard about that one dudes ! since it started in one local it ` s very unlikly to have spread thoughout england in 28 days....big plot holes , dumb ending , 110 pound stupid hero becomes arnold the terminator in 10 mintues . girls decide it ` s far better to die a gruesom death then put out and lose their honor to what looks like a bunch of boy scouts in cammos , who are their only protection.. . really dumb stuff after an excellent start . sad....this was a really superior film for the first 20 mintues .

camera neg 806.txt if i could , i would give this camcorder a 0 of 5. since i now have to search for a new camcorder , from reading other panasonic model reviews , i am convinced i did not just get a lemon , but the panasonic brand is bad . we bought this camcorder 18 months ago at the birth of our son . it has had problems from the beginning . first , i could not finalize the disk . i called panasonic support , who basically told me the problems we were having were because the camera was not being held still while recording . this is ridiculous since i often set the camera down on a countertop so i can be in the video . then i finally got someone to tell me that i needed to be recording on panasonic mini-dvds . the best it has worked have been on the panasonic dvds which are some of the most expensive , and even that is no guarantee that you will be able to watch the dvd after finalization . i still have freezing of the picture and sparatic playback when trying to watch . it has skipped over whole sections . i have 3 dvd players in my home ( all different brands ) and the disk works on none of them . i finally got an address to send it in for repairs . i was not happy to be without my camcorder for an extended period of time . i was told they would look at the camcorder , see if there was a problem and call me . i waited a week after i knew it was in the shop to check the status . panasonic failed to mention that i would need to pay $207.50 up front for them to look at it , then if any repairs were needed , this cost would cover them as well . so , i have been without a camcorder for 3 weeks while waiting to see if it needed fixing , and the company i sent it to has not even looked at it because i have not paid them ! this is crazy since i can get a brand new minidv camcorder for $225. the only reason it has taken me so long to take drastic action is because we are military living overseas and bought it at best buy . so you see why i could n't just take it back to the store ( or i would have a long time ago ) ! also after spending over $500 on this piece of junk , i could not afford to just replace it . sending it in was not an option when my son was a newborn , because i did n't want to miss any precious memories ( which i ened up missing anyway ! ) . so now the holidays are upon us , and i will be forced to purchase another camcorder , since i do n't know if they will send it back to me in time for christmas . i will not pay the $207.50 for a camera that has n't worked well out of the box . i also had to pay shipping both ways for nothing ! plus another thing , the still picture is bad quality . very grainy and you can actually see pixels when you print it . we only used that function once . i have lost so many disks , and have so many others that only play part of the dvd that when i think of it i cry . i have also wasted so much time trying to figure out how to fix the problem with a customer support that is useless . i wish i would have never bought this camcorder ! if you are buying this camcorder to capture memories , buy another ! i will not buy panasonic products again !
dvd pos 857.txt if you 're looking to hear robert johnson 's songs , you should probably buy one of the awesome collections availible . as this legend and musical genius has now been dead for 65 years , i 'm not sure what the other reviewers were looking for besides other people covering his songs , and talk about his life.. . that 's all we have now . and of course the covers do not outdo him ; that would be impossible . but there is some very thoughtful discussion on the life of robert johnson and the world he lived in . the discussion with a former classmate is touching , and the covers of his songs by those who knew him ( robert lockwood jr. , honeyboy edwards ) and by some of the new delta-blues talent such as guy davis , roy rogers and especially alvin youngblood heart blew me away . gov't mule and sonny landreth do some awesome electric renditions of his work . the major let downs are the cuts into interviews and pointless displays of the rock n ' roll hall of fame gathering , and also bob weir 's performance , which is just plain bad . all in all , it is a good film , and it 's nice to actually be able to watch people play his music , as we will never be able to see the real thing

books neg 924.txt the author is a sociologist and tells of testing the opinions of two groups as to oj 's guilt . [there was no test as to the extent of their actual knowledge ! ] you wo n't learn anything new from this book . it has a long list of books on the subject , but the author gave no ratings or summaries on them . were they all equal in quality ? the oj case received more publicity than the oklahoma city bombing or the clinton impeachment . the national association of editors and publishers has never told of the reasons for its play in the news . could it have been intended as a distraction from other news ? in may 1994 the newspapers carried stories on how north korea was ready to attack and start a war ; this was repeated weekly . in 1999 i read that president carter had been sent on a diplomatic mission to north korea ( must have been a success , since the propaganda stopped ) . could the double murders in brentwood have been well-publicized as a distraction ? is n't two murders a day the usual la statistics ? how many other waiters ( just from mezzaluna ) were murdered each year ? are murders by organized crime often solved ? the book " killing time " noted that restaurants and health clubs ( in la and elsewhere ) were often used a fronts for drug dealing and prostitution . if this explains the murders , you wo n't find much in this book . [my experience is that most white americans made up their minds in june 1994 and never let the new facts interfere with their prejudgment.]
books pos 870.txt the snow goose is a beautifully written book that lingers in the memory long after the hour or so that it takes to read . set on the coast of england at the time of dunkirk , it is less about the strife of wwii itself than about its three main characters - one of whom is the snow goose - and what binds them . it is a story about nature , love , and nobility of spirit . to say more would be to give too much away . but it has had a place on my bookshelf for decades , and i reread it when i need to be reminded what is important in life
books neg 932.txt the book i am going to talk about is the book arms and the man by bernard shaw . i really did not like this book because it was hard for me to understand . the reason i did n't like it was because it was challenging for me . the english was hard to understand . i liked how the writer wrote the book and i would probably look for another one of his books . this book was more like an opera with out music . if i could have and known to i probably would not have this enthusiastic about the book . one reason i picked the book was because it was dealing with war and i thought it would have been cool to read about war , but when i got more in to the book it was really not about war it was more about a love at war . if you 're an older audience it would be a good book , or if you 're looking for a good love-war story .

music neg 184.txt ok , first off , this is the first corrs release i 've listenend to . i 'm offering my opinion without knowing anything else they may have done . i 've listened to the cd 10 times or so , on random occasions when i need a break from my normal diet of punk and garage rock . it sounds good . a little too good . i agree that it 's overproduced , does n't sound even remotely spontaneous . the studio work is well done , but overdone . i 'd like to hear something else to see what they really sound like . the content of the songs is what bothers me . aside from being sappy , sentimental drivvel ( this is pop music , after all - i was n't expecting anything else ) , everything sounds like a commercial ditty or a part of a movie soundtrack . mmm-hmm . track 1 - i see a not-so overweight soccermom smiling on a treadmill at curves ( tm ) , then hopping in the ford expedition ( tm ) , and cheering on the kids at their soccer game with a sunnyd ( tm ) in each hand . track 2 - helicopter pans out as mid-20 's girl drives curvy mountain road in vw cabrio ( tm ) ( r ) with top down , thinking about handsome lover.. . " lmn " ( r ) watermark in lower-right corner of screen.. . track 3 - sad animals . images of puppys in cages . track 4 - actually , i like this one . mellow , laid back . track 5 - ugh. track 6 - this one is the most clever ! i see the band members - 3 girls , 1 guy - on one side of a table under a hanging lamp in an otherwise black room , while 3 gentlemen in suits open a breifcase full of money , push it towards them and say , " as you 're aware , the radio has lost it 's credibility . the kids are figuring out that there are other bands out there , beside what we pump across the airwaves at them . we need to entice them back . if you want a single , and this pile of cash says you do , then you 'll do what you can to save this dying medium . hell , you work in the word " radio " and we 'll double what we 're giving you . " come on , the song even sounds like a psa for the international radio marketing council.. . track 7 - sounds like a pepsi commercial . track 8 - ugh. wait , was n't this track 5 ? track 9 - sappy , but ok . sounds like they actually put effort into the lyrics . thumbs up . track 10 - not remotely original , but alright . track 11 - interesting sound . good beat . correct me if i 'm worng , but was that a semi-pagan reference there ? that would be a bold move , for which i 'd applaud them , if in fact it is . not that i 'm pagan or anything , but hey , its a religiously positive , non-christian reference that does n't involve marilyn manson , and that takes guts . especially for radio-loving girls bands . track 12 - laid back . almost has a jazzy , lounge feel . track 13 - produced by former ace of base member ? bubbly , upbeat , not too bad . track 14 - written and produced by avril lavigne.. . track 15 - wow ! a relatively celtic-sounding song from a relatively celtic band ! ! and instrumental , too - big thumbs up ! in fact , maybe that 's the key . whatever . long-winded , i know , but fair . this album did n't turn me off to the corrs completely , but i do n't have very high hopes now . flame away , kiddies .
books neg 751.txt this book can be very damaging if you approach it with the idea that it is absolute truth . as some readers have complained , this is not really a " christian " book because the focus is n't on christ , it 's on you . a biblically centered way of dating would put the focus on loving other people unconditionally , the way jesus would , and not on trying to " find the perfect spouse . " the whole premise of the book is rather un-christlike : making yourself enticing enough to the opposite gender that someone would want to marry you . it 's rather selfish , really , when you consider the words of john the baptist : " christ must become more , i must become less , " as well as the warning in song of solomon " do not awaken love until it so desires . " should n't our primary goal be to glorify christ and not search for earthly shortcuts to fulfilling our desires ? finding a spouse is not like science nor business which have clear procedures or even guidelines . hearts can be broken , and therefore authentic , christlike love must take precedence . i do n't mean to sound accusing , but this book borders close to the type of manipulation that the world cleverly calls " seduction . " my brother humorously commented that the book also tries to turn you into a " poser . " this happens when ' forcing yourself ' to be more masculine or feminine in order to entice the opposite sex . you have to ask : what kind of people are you trying to attract...people who are enticed by your masculinity / femininity or people who are excited about you for who truly are ? i personally would rather a lady be attracted to me for my fruits of the spirit than my looks or personality . it is a combination of both action and faith that is important . faith to set the situations up . action to knock em down

books pos 723.txt this is the second novel in the mystery series featuring marcus didius falco , an informer and sleuth . a series of books that have become hugely popular , so much so that the author is now at the forefront of historical mystery writers . it was probably a stroke of genius on her part to have novels that are extremely well researched and contain all the elements that would be and should be found in rome in ad70 , but to have a lead character who has the vocabulary of a present day new york cop . in this novel the hero marcus didius falco has returned from the remote island of britannia , a god forsaken place whose people are morose and surly and the weather , well the weather is best left to its own devices . marcus has lost his heart to senator 's daughter helena but is not sure that the passion he feels is reciprocated . why is that women he is not interested in , fall over themselves to get to him , but the one that he has lost his heart to , treats him with a cool disdain ? he has not long returned to the welcoming arms of rome before a series of fatal accidents and things that go bump in the night convince falco and the emperor that there are traitors still conspiring and they must be brought to book . falco is not happy , it seems he must leave his beloved rome yet again , but the conspirators are serious about their plans and will not let anyone stand in their way . will falco ever return . .

books neg 225.txt i have no personal experience with 12-step programs nor do i have dominant addictions ( other than book and dvd buying ! ) but i am a psychologist who has seen a lot of people and their stories and regularly deals with smoking , over-eating and love addictions in particular . i was hoping for some new ideas to assist clients . this book takes a rational-emotive type approach to conquering addiction and on that level is fine for those wanting to look at that approach . i also found some of his reference to research of how people recover also quite useful but he seems to have quite a personal , and often over-generalised , attacking crusade against 12-step programs . some of his concerns about possible problems and misunderstandings many people can have with 12-step programs were valid and useful . similarly i welcomed his questioning of the disease model that has people always defining themselves as an addict and powerless . however he has to keep coming back in every chapter to go over and over the evils he sees in 12-step programs - and in very derogatory judgmental language . he often even implies they are all deliberately manipulating and exploiting people . i got very uncomfortable with his imputing these motives to everyone . there appear to be many genuine people of good intention in these movements ( and many who clearly seems to get a lot out of them and have recovered ) . i would have rather he had used his own rational methods rather than resort to such abusive language . he could have suggested modified views and tools , and alternatives to consider . i ca n't imagine that he would lure anyone away from the 12-step programs he criticises by attacking everything they have been standing for . however a gentler exploration of limitations and evidence and suggestions for alternatives may have opened up a welcomed middle ground

camera neg 386.txt there is a serious design flaw with this camera and it is even acknowledged on the faq section of the sony website . " if there are dust particles floating in the air , they can be illuminated by the strong light of the flash and sometimes appear in a recorded image as white , round glare spots . this symptom tends to occur in low-light environments when using a compact digital camera due to the close proximity of the flash to the lens assembly . however , this is not a malfunction . " read : your low-light pictures will have spots all over them ! sony does not think this is a problem . it is a design flaw . if you are only going to use this camera in full sun , then it is fantastic but seriously , there are many other cameras out there that do a much better job !

music neg 345.txt this band is getting alot of critical acclaim right now , but i 'm just not feeling it . the single " wolf like me " is the only song that stands out to me on the whole album . it is a great song , but everything else is just blah . i think the band could use a different singer , the guy they got does n't sing very well or very " soulful " . the music is good , very original and the only reason i have n't sold the cd yet . i really think ppl need to hear this one for themselves before they buy . do n't be fooled by these 5 star reviews . just listen to the cd before you buy it . that 's my advice
books pos 598.txt a pathbreaking work in women 's history and the history of deviancy , this book argues ( if not entirely convincingly ) for a new interpretation of the history and relationship of girl delinquents and women reformers . odem traces the history of middle class women reformers towards sexual delinquency by young girls through the particularly rich case history of los angeles county . noting the diverse cultures in l.a. ( white , working class , hispanic , african-american ) odem argues that many girls who became labeled & quot ; wayward&quot ; were acting out against oppressive and repressive families who held old-fashioned and patriarchal views of girls ' sexuality . odem also explores the eventually oppressive route that reformers took in & quot ; retraining&quot ; wayward girls
music pos 188.txt hayley westenra , at only 18 years old , is an enchanting voice we should be hearing from for many years to come . this is an uplifting and at times , spiritual album that shows shades of greatness . throughout , westenra 's voice is captivating , though the musical scores are at times , sub-par and do not equal the vocal talent . there was an advertising tag on this cd that stated " the female josh grobin " , but i think a more accurate sentiment would be " a young sarah brightman " . odyssey is a fine mix of spiritual and operatic tunes , all of which match up well with westenra 's abilities . bocelli fans will also appreciate the duet , dell amore non si sa . they pair up for that one song , but the rest is all westenra . this is smooth , soothing and easy listening . if you like brightman , you will truly appreciate the voice of westenra .

software pos 405.txt i do n't know what other people are complaining about . i just installed vista ultimate a few days ago and i absolutely love it . no interface lag or any other lag at all . maybe the people complaining have weak or outdated hardware . those people need to turn down their settings if their not going to keep their computers on the cutting edge or at least near it . i 'm glad microsoft is n't waiting for people to catch up and are on the cutting edge . i 'd rather be the one catching up than the other way around . i have a core 2 duo e6300 overclocked to 2.5ghz , 2 gigs of ram , a geforce 7600gt and a western digital raptor 150g hd and vista ultimate works flawlessly on my computer . it 's not the best computer but it runs flawlessly , i built it myself and all the parts cost me about $850 off the net . i play world of warcraft among some other games and i have n't seen any problems yet with any games or any of the major software i use as of yet . i 've only encountered one problem and that was with my old soundblaster live ! 5.1 sound card which has discontinued support . no big deal , it was about time to get a better one anyway . vista is awesome , i love everything about it . it 's very futuristic and it is not a simple interface makeover at all like some clueless dummies proclaim . by the way , i only paid $110 for vista ultimate upgrade off ebay , check there first if you already have an existing os and want to save some dough
camera neg 597.txt the noise problem with this camera is horrendous . do not buy it ! if you take a close-up picture of an eye you will not be able to see the eyelashes clearly.. . never . no matter how hard you try . my 3-year old 5mpx sony is much better than this panasonic camera . i am sorry i bought it . i would return this product if i could and buy a good camera instead . the lumix dmc-lx2 camera cannot focus one bit , many pictures are out of focus and made worse by the noise problem . even with the motion smother function turned on many pictures come out blurred . noise is very noticeable with graininess appearing very readily . you can tweak the quality enhancing features for sharpness , noise reduction , contrast and saturation all you want but these are worthless to reduce the noice and sharpness problem . the amazon website says you can use standard sd memory which is untrue ( perhaps this has been corrected now ) . the camera only accepts more expensive sdhc ( high capacity ) cards . these sdhc cards cannot be read by standard memory stick readers so i have to use the usb port which takes forever to download even a handful of pictures to my computer .
camera neg 823.txt i recommend not to purchase this item . look for another one . the lens itself seems ok , although i ca n't really say , but the adapter which is built in to the lens is shoddy and cumbersome and ruins the the whole deal . the adapter is a quick release type where one end attaches to the camera and the lens simply snaps in , or is quickly released . this would be great , except for two very important things . one , the lens fits very loosely in the quick release adapter . this causes some major distortion , especially when moving . two , the housing is made of thin plastic which does not seem very durable . in fact it is so cheaply thin that i am afraid to leave it in my car because the heat may distort the plastic . one drop , even a small one , and it is done for

books pos 257.txt his basic thesis is that a liberal empire can be a greatly positive force in the world , and that the united states is already an empire , but that our inablility to acknowledge the fact leads us to waste our opportunities to be the afore mentioned positive force . ferguson writes that america is plagued by an attention deficit disorder and too much love of the good life . thus , we get distracted too easily from important events overseas , and when we do try to intervene , we want quick fixes and low costs . i could n't agree more with most of these points . as an american , i 'm greatly ashamed of our collective ignorance . i hate feeling like a foreigner in my our country because i watch the news or can find sumatra on a map . also , the book strikes a chord with me because of my frustration with half measures in foreign interventions . countless times , i believe america has done more harm than good by , if you will , talking the talk but not walking the walk . if we commit to something , we need to follow through . this is as true in iraq today as it has been in the past . we 've claimed to support democracy in latin america , but then turned bannana republics into bannana autocracies . we greatly prolonged and increased vietnam 's suffering without changing the end result at all . with all this commonality , however , there are a few leaps of logic that ferguson makes that i ca n't bring myself to agree with . basically , he did n't sell me on the thought that the imperial model is the best way to develop the world . how are we supposed to know what is best for everyone ? wo n't our own biases and self interests inevitably distort even our most altruistic efforts ? when ferguson hold 's up the british empire as a model of success , i ca n't help but notice that the best results came only to those places of british colonization , with horrendous consequences for each of the native populations there . and the two greatest examples of beneficial american imperialism - japan and germany - were already highly developed before world war ii , so it probably was n't that much of a wonder that we were able to help them return to such a state . even if the positive power of empire is conceded , there are important differences between the state of world during the british empire and the state of the world now . it 's a concern of immunity from repercussions . in the golden age of imperialism , europe was in a kind of splendid isolation from its empires . not to say that there were no reprercussions , but , with the only modern navies in the world , europe was immune to any very serious threats . on the other hand , in today 's world , as an effect of globalization , power has become more decentralized in some respects . think wmds , terrorists , and foreign investments in the u.s. economy , for example . can america as easily afford to make enemies in the developing world as the british could ? in the end " colossus " did n't settle any agruments for me , but raised new and interesting questions . it is a book that makes you think , and that in and of itself is worth four stars .
camera neg 538.txt i have one word for the argus quick clix , horrible . i bought two of these cameras to give to my daughters for christmas . the camera lists numerous features and that is what enticed me to buy them . i was looking for an inexpensive camera for general use . this camera takes horrible pictures . all of the photos had a blue tinge to them and were fuzzy . when the flash was used it was so strong that there was nothing but white out of the subject . one very irritating feature is that the camera comes on with the flash off . there is no way to change a setting to let it come on with the flash . you have to go through a series of menus to turn it on and then it takes almost 20 seconds for the flash to get ready to use . as stated when it finally does come on and you take a picture , it is so bright that the picture is useless . i would not recommend this camera to anyone

dvd pos 907.txt this movie is intimate and special . some reviews say it is the story of obsession , of fetishism , of trivial things . however , this movie is the story of something special in a young teenage boy 's life : his fantasy woman . the character malena rarely speaks throughout the movie , but we see her exactly how we are supposed to see her - through the eyes of an old man telling the story of himself in young " love " . this perspective makes her ideal and special , with few flaws , as a fantasy woman is to a young man . malena is instantly a likeable character , not awful and disgusting like those using her . we cannot forget that our narrator , renato , is not actually a teenage boy but an older man telling his own story . therefore , he is unreliable as a narrator . malena 's sins are washed clean through his judgement , and we believe him when we see her victimized by the other women . however , renato has had years to think about everything , to contemplate what really happened to her . so , in the end , the people who use her are completely despicable , unable to garner any liking . of course , she is a victim , but she eventually falls into the gossip that others believe she is guilty of with the men . the movie does offer a hint that she could have escaped all of the problems : she is from another city and her husband , for most of the movie , is dead . yet , she chooses to not escape but to stay , and her fate is sealed . the music in the movie was nominated for best score in 2000 , and it is beautiful , emotional . it truly adds to the feeling of the movie . i would recommend this movie to anyone for the compelling story , emotion , and characters . you will never forget this movie .

dvd neg 259.txt i hate lawyers . what is a lawyer , anyway ? basically : it 's a telemarketer in a decent suit , a guy who would be hawking the latest ronco hair-in-a-can super-duper late night special to folks in akron over his plantronic headset , only he won the genetic lottery and got shot out of an upper-middle class womb . shakespeare said it first and best : " first , let 's kill all the lawyers ! " . former enron uber-dealmaker john wing put a little fast-times houston spin on that one : " get all the lawyers in a room- --and shoot ' em ! - --in the mouth , so you *can't * miss ! " exactly . anyway , " the firm " is a flick that purports to make the world of high-priced yappers jaw-rippingly exciting , so i was probably all amped up to despise it . but not really : back before i dug into a gig with the dark side in high finance , back when i was hefting a backpack over the sodden campus of my old alma mater , i briefly considered going into law : briefly , for about an hour . it was a desperate time , and i needed money . why did i consider walking hell 's highway , if only for an instant ? because john grisham , boring lawyer-turned-ripping-potboiler-writer-turned-back-into-boring-lawyer , a kind of tom clancy for the paper-pusher and green-eyeshade set , made it all sound pretty damned funky ( and lucrative ! hey , dig that bmw 7 series , baby , beep beep ! ) in his engrossing little novel " the firm " : granted , i 've read better prose on the backs of cereal boxes , but it held my attention . i mean , seriously : you 're 19 , and the whole flying out on the corporate lear to grand cayman and switching out briefcases full of cash sounds kinda cool . and strippers , man , plenty of strippers . oh , and did someone mention a bmw ? what 's the difference between a lawyer and a snake ? the snake at least has the decency to hiss before it sinks its fangs into your a**. now it 's true : grisham writes like kim jong il sings , but- --in " the firm " , anyway- --he was a master craftsman at moving things along at a bristling pace , from the pedestrian- --hotshot law school whiz kid gets picked up by a memphis white-shoe law firm- --to the pretty damned atrocious , all while keeping the pressure ratcheted up with a dense , suffocating sense of malice . grisham , like michael crichton , is n't a prose genius : he 's not even mediocre . but he writes for film , and " the firm " cried out for cinematic treatment . so it 's baffling that , with all the right stuff- --tom cruise as winsome lead mitch mcdeere , gene hackman doing his chain-drinking gene hackman thang as the corrupt ( but ultimately worn-out and pathetic ) senior partner , and sydney pollack helming it up- --that the big-screen treatment of " the firm " is such a yawner . talk about contempt of court . pollack takes all that intricately woven little grisham-plot and barfs big ugly chunks of it up on the screen . at its guts , really , " the firm " was really nothing more than the big career nightmare : i 've bet the farm on this gig , i 'm getting big money , i 'm working like a fiend , my wife is having trouble remembering my name , and evidently i 'm not doing tax-deals for loaded clients- --i 'm doing money laundering for the mob . pollack just mangles the whole thing , convolutes the simple , and renders up a flick that will have you checking your watch and yawning . casting is part of the problem : cruise does his thing , running around memphis with his briefcase . hackman drinks a lot and exudes pure armani-clad sleaze : " the firm " is all funny-wrinkles when he 's onscreen , but hey , a man can only do so much . jeanne tripplehorn ( cruise 's squeeze ) , who plays lara san giacomo when she 's not playing tripplehorn ( seriously , google the two of ' em : astounding ! ) is a bitter old battleaxe who made me want to stick forks in my eyes . wilford brimley is just plain wrong as the firm 's security chief : too bald , too cracker , too rotund , too silly , too low-end , to do the role justice . holly hunter is even worse : hunter is one of those eighties thangs who got pumped up as something sexy , which is baffling , given that she 's about 3'8 , and has all the sex appeal of an oompah-loompah . it does n't help that she 's a big , ugly southern stereotype , the caricature most denizens of dumpy michigan towns imagine southerners to be . you want her to die : she doesn't . pollack wants us to think she 's clever and funny . she isn't . ed harris , i think , is in this movie . so is hal holbrook , which kinda ruins everything , because everytime hal holbrook is in a movie you know you 're dealing with a bunch of friggin ' crooks . anyway , the coup de grace to the stupidity is the entrance , deus ex machina , of paul sorvino ( don morolto- --what kind of goombah name is dat , anyway ? somebody call tony soprano ! ) , who takes this juggernaut of boredom from the merely stupid to the totally ridiculous . if you wanna see tom cruise running around memphis with his briefcase for two hours , by all means belly up to the bar . otherwise , case dismissed . js

books pos 892.txt this is an enlightening , meticulous story of william " boss " tweed and , as past of the context , his three key cronies in the ring : peter sweeny , richard connolly and oakley hall . it is a story about how the new york times elevated itself by getting the goods on corruption and bravely exposing it on the front page . oh how the mighty have fallen ! the time of power ( terror ? ) for tweed 's edition of tammany hall was relatively short , but tammany hall power lingered well after tweed 's demise , another eithy-five years . the critical moment to the story is when tweed engineers the proverbial license to steal by devising a new charter for new york city , putting the power in the hands of his incredibly greedy ring of thieves . the four took this opportunity to carve out a fortune for themselves , primarily by paying millions of dollars for a courthouse that should have cost a few hundred thousand to build . a disgruntled ' whistleblower ' ( the term had no meaning back then ) copied over the records in enough detail to demonstrate the bold theft and fraud . there are several versions of how the blockbuster story of the padded expenses and outright theft came into the times ' hands , but the remarkable part of the story is just how brazen the " ring " could be , how convinced they were of their own invincibility or ability to bribe , cheat and steal their way out of any legal investigation or hearings . people who today believe we live in an era of unbridled corporate greed and ethical lapses need to read this book to better understand how much the supposed watchdog and people 's friend - - the government - - can be part of the problem and a barrier to the solution . the cast of characters , sinners , ( few ) saints , and masses of immigrants makes following the flow of the book sometimes a challenging task . thomas nast , a pivotal character if not the hero of the book , provides some vivid , visual signposts . nast not only draws a compelling picture for often illiterate ' readers ' , he was one of the first to put a face on public figures who heretofore had not been subjected to portraits or paparazzi as are today 's politicians . nast 's giving tweed a face may have been one of the breakthrough aspects of this story . it certainly helped catch tweed when he jumped bail . a few maps , perhaps some old drawings , and even a list of key characters could have perhaps clarified some of the story or reduced my thumbing back to previous pages or checking the index for the entry and bio of important members of the cast . there are some historic new york times front page stories that help create atmosphere and context . any reasonably educated american should have learned at least the sketchy details of tweed 's nefarious deeds and nast 's colorful cartoons . ackerman does an excellent job of documenting and detailing , filling in the gaps , and bringing now faded , black-and-white characters back to life

health pos 947.txt i cannot say how well this product really compares to other sunscreens in terms of sun protection . but it does have the right ingredients that most top-rated sunscreens / sunblocks use , so it should be at least on par with them . where this product really shines ( or does n't shine ) is for people with combination / oily skin . i have tried many sunscreens , and it 's so hard to find a sunscreen without moisturizers ( if you have oily skin , that 's already your natural moisturizers ) . i have even tried other neutrogena sunscreens that are supposed to be oil free and all that . the result on my face ? after applying it , i always shine ( which is not what i want ) . this magnificent product , however , actually gives my face a nice matte finish.. . and matte feel , too ! it 's a pretty thick cream when you first apply it ( as opposed to other suncreens or other products that feel more like lotion ) , but is almost immediately absorbed by the skin . in 30 seconds , there is no more greasy / creamy feeling , and in one minute , if you feel your skin , there 's a nice matte feel . however , and this is not the fault of the product , after about 3 hours ( at least for me ) , then i feel like the matte effect has worn off , and my oily skin is again showing its oily nature . still , as far as suncreens go , this is the best i have tried for my skin , and i highly recommend it for people with combination / oily skin . btw , this review is for the actual product i got , which is spf 30. as of the time i am writing this review , here in amazon they also offer an spf 45 version , and cheaper , too ! i do n't know the difference , but i always go for the lower one ( in this case , spf 30 ) , because i theorize - - rightly or wrongly , i do n't know - - that the lesser the spf , the lesser the strength of the ingredients , so maybe it 's better for sensitive skin ( ? )

books neg 691.txt first off : i 'd like it better if we had 1 / 2-star options . judas unchained really does n't deserve a 2 , more a 2-1 / 2 or 2-3 / 4. i have a love / hate relationship with peter hamilton 's books . he 's very adept at introducing interesting technology and making a faster-than-light society plausible but , as with a lot of these hard-science , libertarian sf authors , he badly needs an editor . i was skipping over multiple pages of irrelevance in both this book and its prequel , pandora 's star . he also has far too many " main characters " who ( despite 800+ pages ) never seem to come alive . they all speak with essentially the same voice . and when he tries to individualize someone they come off as badly stereotyped ' 60s era hippies - - come on , does anyone seriously say " dude " in the real world much less the imagined future of the 24th century ? and why is hamilton so obsessed with sex with young ( or rejuvenated ) women ? hamilton 's treatment of virtual immortality is hit and miss at best . on the one hand , the innate conservatism of an immortal civilization is well developed , represented and believable . on the other hand , the dynamics of the relationship between " old timers " and " first lifers " is unsatisfactory . in four centuries , for example , no one has even attempted to unseat nigel sheldon from his position as head of the sheldon dynasty ? perhaps the commonwealth 's continual expansion is the safety valve but even here , the government ( controlled the eternal heads of these dynasties ) controls it . another point that is brought up briefly is why would anyone want to live forever if their life did n't change - - i mean the characters of a novel ( almost by definition ) are dynamic , go-get - 'em types but most people just plod through their lives and then die . why would anyone want to do that for lifetime after lifetime ? the aliens are ok . the problem with them ( and this is true of nearly every sf story ) is that they tend to be one dimensional - - they 're all of a singular type and all too often they really do just act like human beings with weird make up . ( this is a problem in fantasy stories , too . ) on the plus side , i do tip my hat to hamilton for not allowing the humans to save themselves with an alien " deus ex machina . " ozzie 's adventures in " wonderland " ( i.e. , the silfen paths ) do bring him to the adult silfen and he does find out the origins of the dyson barriers but the knowledge does n't really help anyone defeat the primes . overall , if you started with pandora 's star , you probably should finish the journey with judas unchained . if you have n't started down this " silfen path , " i recommend alistair reynolds , tony daniel or iain banks . they write similarly grand space opera but are better at it than hamilton has proven himself to be to date

camera pos 67.txt i had been waiting 3 years for any manufacturer to market a camera similar in specification to the canon eos1. as exploration health , safety & environment advisor , work takes me to middle of the desert or the oceans . the wait was for 35mm film quality , with speed of picture taking ( 5 frames per second is barely enough to capture dolphins - hence the 8 + fps of the eos 1 was desired ) . there was a parallel wait for an image stabilised 28-300 zoom lens . let 's cut the story short . if i want a camera to bring on holiday , it would not be this one - the battery and charger are too heavy and bulky ; instead i would choose the eos20d without hesitation . but having hundreds of failed 35mm film frames i decided not to wait any longer but to buy the eos1d mark ii because the 1ds mark ii is not fast enough at 4 frames a second . with 35mm cameras , after a few seconds on the shooting , i would have to run back inside to the cabin ( of a ship ) to change film . if there is large enough memory card in the eos1dii , there is no need . this camera is built with seals against the environment ( and so does the 28-300mm lens ) . instead of being scared of running out of film , now it is easy to keep the shutter button pressed while panning ( and hoping ) the dolphins do their jumps into the air . with the 28-300mm lens attached , there is no need to change lenses either . dolphins riding the bow wave of the ship could be captured at 28mm while those further away could be caught with 300mm setting . it is a disappointment that the battery is not lion but the older nimh . but as with any photo gear requiring a battery it is wise to have a spare , whatever the substance . i just wish canon package a small travel size charger instead of the standard one which is very bulky . it has connections for two batteries ( yet it could only charge one following the other ) but most people would be happy using one battery while the other one is being charged . you just try to convince some airport officials to let you on the plane with the above kit , binoculars , laptop , mobile phone , gps.......ext . hard disk....as hand luggage . for work , i am committed and therefore bear the weight and troubles of hauling the hardware . but for holidays , i would choose the eos20d with built-in flash because who would want to lug around 3 kilos all day plus flash gun and possibly a tripod ? the camera gets 4.5 stars but the battery and charger lets it down . why just 4.5 stars ? one of the beauties i had thought with digital slr was not having to do anything in processing , just transfer the images to the computer . wrong . the .jpg straight out of the camera is not sharp enough . post processing is required . why ? why is that necessary when the canon s60 ( which i use for different assignments ( with underwater housing ) ) does n't need to ? that defeats the point of having a .jpg file at 5.5 meg when the 1.5 meg of the s60 looks sharper straight out of the camera ? still , there is raw if the standard output is not suficient . incidentally , the eos1dsii also produces 5.5 meg .jpg and those also require post processing . for those of us who are not interested in working longer than necessary ( me ) 16.7 million pixels would seem a bit wasted . i am still waiting for the camera which produces sharp .jpg files in-camera without having to post process , and can shoot at 8+ fps with a sensor size equivalent to 35mm film . meantime i shall have to learn to shoot with raw files and post process . also incidentally , the sensor size of the eos20d is smaller , which means although itself is lighter than the eos1d series camera , having to carry around an extrawide lens is not my idea of fun on holiday . the magnification ratio for the eos1dii is 1.3 whereas the eos20d is 1.6. this means i could still travel reasonably light ( compromise ) with the 1dii and 28-135mm is lens attached . sure it is possible to use stitching but that is more time spent at the computer and time is precious . any regrets ? none what-so-ever . it is state of the technology at the moment . another benefit of using digital is that , it does n't matter if you had been shooting iso 100 all day . come the night if you want to shoot the rig with a moon as backdrop , just change to iso 1600 without having to bother about " pushing2 the film in developing . it 's a beauty when an is l lens is attached . you 'd need is when there is machinery vibrations and the ship is moving with the swell ! good job canon . now you need to shoe horn in a more capable cpu ( to process the images in-camera ) , fit the 1dsii sensor into this one or this motordrive into the 1dsii and you may persuade me to part with more cash .
camera neg 824.txt i bought this camera after my 3-year-old broke my kodak z700. i loved my z700 , even though it was only 4mp and did n't have a lot of the features the newer cameras have . i figured that buying a newer kodak model and upgrading to 6mp would be a no-brainer , but i was disappointed in 2 major areas . first , the lag time is so slow on the c653 , when i took pictures of my kids i rarely got what i was expecting to see . the smile or look that i saw when the flash went was long gone by the time it captures . we experimented with tons of settings and there was no difference . the other disappointing area was low-light picture quality . anything i shot indoors was grainy except where the flash hit . every background was grainy . terrible . using the low-light settings fixed the problem , but then your subject is blurry because you 're not in " sports " or " kids " mode anymore ( which we used all the time with the z700 for taking pics of the kids ) . on my z700 ( which is only $150 now ) , i could set it and forget it . set it to " action " , and it took perfect pics indoors , or out , moving or stationary . that 's what i thought i was getting in the c653 , but i was wrong . i ended up returning the camera

dvd pos 105.txt there 's not much to say about the reputation of these movies . there 's also little to say about these dvds , many of which are the high quality special edition collections . just do the math . this is no brainer for people who do n't own any of these dvds . even if you only want 8 of them ( less than half ! ) , that 's about $20.00 a movie ( at amazon 's present sales price ) and since many of these movies are special editions , that 's still a steal ! this is a solid place to start your dvd collection . not everyone will enjoy all these movies ( after all , they range from westerns to romantic pieces to musicals ) , but at this price even giving half of them away still allows you a tremendous savings . one note : the version of amadeus here is the reissue and the longer , director 's cut of the movie that was not originally released . some ( including myself ) prefer the tighter original release ( which can still be gotten at amazon but sadly has no commentary and requires you to flip the disc in the middle of the movie ! )

music pos 933.txt about the band : dead can dance is considered the seminal example of the ethereal or heavenly voices genre . in fact , the name of the label , 4ad , which carried many of the 1990s dcd releases , is sometimes also used to describe this genre of music , which is a fusion of subtle electronics , vocals , drums , world music , and a near limitless count of instruments . brendan perry sometimes has been described as a gothic frank sinatra . lisa gerrard 's enchanting vocals are often sung in a language only known to lisa . i count myself among the many that hold these two musicians in the highest esteem . about the album : compared to more recent albums that are loaded with bonus tracks , the 50-minutes of into the labyrinth would seem short , if it were n't for the fact that i like to listen to this album over and over again . i count this album as one of my all time favorites , and certainly my most prized dead can dance cd . one of the nicest things about this album is that it features nearly equal amounts of both lisa 's and brendan 's ghostly vocals . on some tracks they accompany each other , while others feature only one of the artist 's chilling or mystical sounding vocals . simply put , this is beautiful music to relax to . i honestly give this album my highest recommendations ! two tracks i 'd recommend sampling : " towards the within " ( featuring lisa 's vox w / brendan backing ) and " tell me about the forest " ( featuring brendan 's vox ) . i believe they best represent the range of songs you can expect with this album . please note that while all the tracks feature vocals , the lyrics for only those sung in english are included in the liner notes . similar artists : chances are if you are n't yet familiar with dead can dance , that you 've not yet discovered some of these other bands , but i highly recommend them as well : das zeichen , impressions of winter , love is colder than death , qntal , corvus corax , or helium vola . there is a rather large ( and somewhat underappreciated ) range of artists still producing heavenly voices music that is similar in quality to dead can dance . please check some of them out as well .

( clearly done when the film was cut together after the main filming ) it was surprising that they could not take the time to get seagal to do the vocal tracks for those sections . there were also very few action sequences that demonstrated seagal 's skills with martial arts . in many ways , this film was more of a slasher flick than an action film . little action , but lots of bloody corpses lying about . i enjoyed black dawn far more , and feel it was a much better made film
books neg 206.txt on our beloved kay scarpetta and the illustrious ms. cornwell ? having been an avid fan of her novels from the very beginning , i simply cannot help but ask myself....is she really writing this stuff ? very slow in the beginning , i began to fear a repeat of the struggle that i endured to finish blowfly . however , this novel does begin to pick up momentum...but not until the reader is halfway through , and certainly not until this author had left me sufficiently disgusted . the storyline finds scarpetta summoned home to the scene of the crime...richmond , virginia , where her previous employer seeks her assistance in unwraveling the mysterious death of a young girl . so scarpetta- --with marino tagging along of course- --heads back to richmond from her new home in florida to offer assistance ; only to find that her old building is being demolished...and that the new one , under the leadership of dr. joel marcus , is sloppy regarding policies and procedures . the demoralization of her former staff by dr. marcus is also unnerving to scarpetta ; and clearly he resents her intrusion . so why has he asked her to come ? meanwhile , lucy , as head of the last precinct , is once again up to her ears in nonsense . for such a brilliant , successful young woman ( as readers have always been lead to believe ) , why must cornwell insist on making her so completely stupid in her literary life ? in this tale she is once again romantically linked with a narcissistic sociopath who also happens to be her employee . worse than the weak storyline , and the fact that this novel is just all over the place , is the author 's disturbingly sterotypical portrayal of african-americans throughout . drug dealers are black , they 're dead of gunshot wounds , and most ludicrous of all is in one instance cornwell references a dead young man 's " conspicuously large organ . " are you kidding me ? the trash collectors are " big dark men " and of course in an upscale neighborhood , the " old black woman " must work in one of the houses . the author 's unbelievably narrow-minded , stereotypical view of other races is disturbing at best , and frankly makes one think that she may just be as stupid from a common sense perspective as lucy . read only if you must , but frankly there are better ways to spend your time . dy

books pos 263.txt deyoung begins by relating how bush pushed powell out at the end of his 1st term , without the courtesy of even personally discussing it with him ; making matters worse was the fact that bush did n't even know why powell was at the white house when it came time to say " good bye . " colin powell came from jamaican parents ( often called " jewmaicans " by american negroes because of the emphasis they placed on hard work and education ) , and during his early life in the nyc area suffered little , if any , racial prejudice . later on , unfortunately , the insults were quite aggravating , but powell was determined to not let them inhibit his performance . powell was an indifferent student in high school and at ccny ( majored in geology ) ; however , rotc piqued his sophomore-year interest and he soon became a standout . powell went on to be selected outstanding cadet , and top graduate ( or very close ) in every military training setting he undertook , as well as a top mba student at george washington university . he also was top-ranked by superiors in almost every military assignment , leading to his being offered a white house fellowship , which in turn provided powell with travel to russia and china and brought him in contact with a number of influential people who were impressed enough to forward powell onto chairman of the joint chiefs , national security advisor , and secretary of state . one of powell 's " secrets of success " was to enthusiastically implement all orders , even those he considered silly - powell himself believed that doing otherwise grounded the careers of many talented others . unfortunately , powell eventually crossed paths with dick cheney ( a bit of a problem during gulf war i ; a serious problem when cheney became v.p. ) . between cheney 's far-right bias ( " out on the looney fringe " - per powell ) and bush ii 's " disturbingly disjointed " decision-making - per treasury secretary o'neill ) , powell 's contributions as secretary of state were severely limited and constantly undermined and countermanded - often with don rumsfeld 's help . in addition , he was often left out of important decisions , especially when out of the country . ultimately , powell 's credibility suffered from the inaccurate information provided in his u.n. speech attesting to saddam 's wmd . the big question , still debated , is " why did n't he resign ? " his supporters believe the reason is that powell 's nature simply did n't allow anything less than 100% support . bottom line : if cheney had not been such an ideologue ( telling bush there were no candidates good enough to run as his v.p. - ignoring powell , and then sliding into the position himself ) , powell would be v.p. today , possibly president in 2008. similarly , if bush #41 had not been so stubborn and instead replaced quayle with powell in ' 92 , powell might well have become first v.p. , and then president

camera pos 700.txt i have to get on the bandwagon here . this is a superb little camera , definately five stars ! i also have the tz1 , which showed promise , but has limitations . in my review of the tz1 , i noted it had lots of " noise " and pictures should n't be printed much beyond 4x6 inches if they were to be sharp . i also wanted more manual controls . the tz3 fixes and improves almost everything about the tz1 and adds some new , very useful features . the noise has been drastically reduced , the lens is better , the sensor is bigger , and the processor is not only faster , but produces better pictures . the tz3 adds a very handy " function " button - or i should say function capability - the number of buttons is the same - which gives immediate access to five or so " most used " settings without having to go into the menues - of which there are several . the tz3 keeps the mega optical image stabilization and adds intelligent iso , increases the sensitivity without adding noise , ( i have not tried the 3200 setting yet . ) , increases the size of the viewing screen , etc. , etc. the tz3 is a " well-rounded , " and very capable camera . there is simply no comparison between the tz1 and the tz3 as far as the quality of the pictures . the tz3 wins hands down . in my opinion it also beats some big name , higher priced digicams - a couple of which i own - rather handily . of course , the big selling point for the tz3 is still the 10x lens - now with wide angle capability - on a pocket-sized point and shoot camera . this lens is sharp , and combined with larger sensor and the new processor yields some excellent results . while there are no manual controls , per se , the camera seems to do very well without them . pictures are sharp , exposures seem nicely done ( have n't tried it at night yet , but low light forrest shots were excellent ) , colors were accurate , appropriately saturated , and vivid ( ok . i like the vivid setting . ) , good contrast , etc. there are a variety of af settings , settable focal points , and focus modes . there is also exposure compensation , and exposure bracketing available - and they work well ! the live histogram is a welcome bonus . the tz3 focuses down to about 2 inches in macro mode - again with excellent , sharp results . the tz3 is very well speced out . one nice thing that is gone is the lens cap on the tz1. it was really not to inconvenient , but seemed always to be swinging in the wind to add yet another source of camera shake . the tz3 lens includes an built in lens cover . very welcome . i currently own five top flight digicams ( including this one ) , and have owned about that many others , i am most impressed with this one - for combined convenience and results . it is a quantum step forward . i also have a couple of quite nice , and fairly complete dslr kits . they are wonderful , and in a class by themselves , but when i want very nice pictures and the convenience of a pocketable point and shoot with a 10x , wide angle lens , or a back up for the dslrs , the tz3 is now my camera of choice .

books pos 259.txt shakespeare 's life is frustratingly beyond our sight . aside from the plays ( which , in many cases , come down to us in different versions ) , we have a slim scattering of legal documents , marriage and birth records , and vague secondary accounts . as the world 's preeminent shakespeare scholar , greenblatt has managed to assemble all these sources and , with a healthy dose of conjecture , arrive at something resembling a biography of the world 's greatest dramatist . more than that , though , this work is a biography of the age in which shakespeare lived and wrote- --elizabethan and jacobian london- --and how the major events of this time affected shakespeare 's plays . for example , the writing of king lear may have been encouraged by a trial in 1603 in which two sisters tried to have their father declared insane so they could take control of his wealth and estate , while the youngest daughter ( named cordell ) tried to stop them- --a story uncannily similar to what is considered to be the bard 's greatest tragedy . what impressed me the most about this biography is how ordinary shakespeare seemingly was . he did n't seem pretentious or snobbish , as some people envision him . he was born to a humble family and lived frugally , despite dying a rather wealthy man . although greenblatt 's writing is clear and accessible , he makes the assumption that you have already read shakespeare 's plays , or at least are very familiar with them . i have read about two thirds of them and felt a little behind when he discussed plays i had n't read , so if you have n't read more than , say , ten of his plays , the major ones , you need to crack open the norton shakespeare ( of which greenblatt is the editor-in-chief ) before you approach will in the world .
camera neg 917.txt after being an amature photographer via print film , i decided to try a digital camera - though i 've been leary about printing quality . i knew i could n't afford a digital slr , so i opted for a " snap shot " camera that i thought would have enough features to satisfy me . however , after having and using this camera for a year now , i am so disappointed in the performace - the flash is just way too much , its a washout . after being used to print and picture quality in my film slr ( cannon , i might add ) , i was so severely annoyed with the quality of the pictures with this camera , i wish i would have just saved my money for a digital slr .

software neg 394.txt i 'm an amateur photographer and i use photoshop cs2 for most of my digital editing . i decided i needed a colorimeter based on the recommendations of many books that i have read on digital editing . i had to download an update of the software program before i could start using my spyder . this procedure alone took several hours because i kept getting " error " messages . i ca n't count how many times i unloaded and reloaded the program . i was eventually able to run the program , however , every time i calibrated my one year old emachine crt monitor , it left me with an orange color cast on my screen . i worked with colorvision technical support for many frustrating hours . the technical support person i was working with was very pleasant and really tried to help me . they even mailed me a new sensor because they thought the first one was defective . unfortunately i was unable to get the orange color cast removed from my monitor . after several weeks of trying to get the spyder2 express to calibrate my monitor , i gave up . i just did n't want to spend any more time trying to get it to work so it was returned . i really wanted it to work . i 'm back to using adobe gamma .

dvd neg 428.txt this particular dvd edition of nosferatu is an excellent example of the importance of music in setting a film 's mood . i 'm not sure when this " score " was " written " , although it is far from effective in depicting the time period of the film . nor does it convey the proper mood in many points during the film . with this edition 's music , i got confused at times between what i saw and what i heard , and the whole thing became an unaffective joke after a while . if you want an affective , edge-of-the-seat experience out of nosferatu , i reccomend another edition .

health neg 437.txt i got the fusion razor in the mail a few weeks ago so i decided to give it a try . at first it seemed ok , but i started noticing that it pulled at the hair on my face more than my mach 3 turbo . i decided to experiment and shave half of my face with a mach 3 turbo and the other half with the fusion . from my experience , the mach 3 turbo gave a closer shave , and glided much smoother across my skin than the fusion . i think the 5 blades on the fusion are more of a gimmick than anything else . and as cool as the single trimming blade is , it seems like gillette had to include this because of the poor accuracy of having 5 blades . in other words , the single blade is a fix rather than a feature . my call is if your using a mach 3 turbo , do n't waste your money on the fusion

" vikki 's final track ' spotlight ' is a pure gem , emotional and raw but utterly beautiful . ' attention ' finishes the album well with that familliar waify energy and pulse , almost blue grass , almost country , but totally wonderful .
dvd pos 906.txt in sanskrit , ayurveda means the study of life . according to ancient hindu texts , all healing systems stem from ayurvedic medicine . this ancient ayurveda series dvd , led by sarah tomlinson with clarity and insight , provides a blueprint for increasing self-awareness through the use of asana , symbol and metaphor . tomlinson , acts like a loving guide to going inward and discovering new self-truths . to effectively bring about change in our bodies and minds , we must change habitual patterns in the body . the poses in the series takes us through a full range of challenging movements , and tomlinson illuminates the wisdom of this practice by brilliantly threading together how the poses evoke certain states of mind and spirit . filmed against a simple , soothing background , tomlinson wisely avoids distracting bells and whistles . instead , the accompanying chanting by ayurveda master gandharva , directly relates to the series in it 's use of each of the planetary mantras . tomlinson 's has a great depth of knowledge about ayurveda , and she weaves many subtle suggestions and information about the benefits of each pose into the practice . this dvd is appropriate for beginner and advanced student : beginners will feel supported and encouraged , as well as exhilirated by the practice , and more experienced students will appreciate the multi-level aspect of tomlinson 's class . l . landau , teacher and student

dvd neg 363.txt the problem with this film is i read the book . i was disappointed simply because ` be cool ' is an obvious showcase for the musical talent . the overly long dance sequence with john travolta and uma thurman is a prime example . somewhere the bulk of the story was lost- -and there are some very- -very good characters appearing in the film that would 've been more intersing if somebody would 've said , " hey , do n't forget the book ! " but being true to the original source is not hollywood 's strong suit . " be cool " provides some popular music , some known faces , but without john travolta , the movie would never have been made . a few laughs are provided . a couple ironic scenes show up , but there 's too little to sustain a full-length feature . basically , the project is a disservice to everyone involved . some of the characters are so thin- -face it- -poor christina milian as linda moon , is reduced to being a voice that sways when she sings- -a clichï¿½ . the rock does the best he can but again , ` he 's a gay bodyguard ; ' he 's the brunt of insulting jokes offered up by a raji , his boss [vince vaughn] , who , in the book , is far more sinister- -but in the film he 's an idiot . of course chili is chili . travolta does a very nice job , and chili 's obviously the smartest guy in the room . uma thruman 's performance is , well , not funny- -not serious , not intense- -not much- - at best , she made me shrug . i do like what harvey keitel did with nick carr , but there 's just not enough , and all the negatives reflect completely on the director . enough said there . my advice , watch ` get shorty'again , or read ` be cool .

" do i see dollar signs in your eyes ? i thought so . do n't fall for the trap . if you want to learn a thing or two about rf electronics theory as well as detailed explanations of what the job of each individual component ( like a capacitor here or a resistor there ) in a communication circuit is , then buy : modern electronic communication ( 9th edition ) by gary m. miller . the miller book 's 9th edition is coming out soon . even with 992 pages of text , it costs only $60.00. i believe razavi 's book should never have been published because frankly , it 's not a book at all . why it 's still in print ( though stuck at first edition for nearly 10 years ) , is completely beyond any sane person 's comprehension
books pos 981.txt reading late james - particularly " the golden bowl " - often strikes me as being similar to reading a novel in a foreign language whose vocabulary you have mastered but whose grammar remains partially a mystery . anyone who has attempted this will recognise the sensation of understanding all the words , yet not understanding how they fit together . you read a sentence two , three or five times , and it is only then that you understand , if at all , the meaning of all the words combined . sometimes the meaning never becomes clear . " late james " is a foreign language , but one in which i have become more fluent over the years . when i first read " the golden bowl " some years ago i understood very little and did not enjoy it . the long , convoluted sentences , with so many things only half spoken - and often never spoken at all - seemed a vast and elaborate machine which never seemed to produce enough to justify its own existence . yet now , having read most of james over the intervening years , i have become more fluent in his language , and find the circumlocutions , complexities and ellipses of the " late style " , if not exactly crystal clear , then certainly much clearer , and even rather comforting and enjoyable . the subtle discriminations , the way james holds up to the light tenuous motives and turns them slowly - very slowly - so that their hidden facets become , fleetingly , visible ; the very real portrayal of interesting characters that james reveals ; as well as the languorous , unpredictable turns of a jamesian sentence - all offer the kinds of pleasures that no other writer ( possibly excepting proust ) is able to produce . " the golden bowl " consists largely of conversations , some continuing over many , many pages . the content of those conversations would , for most writers , comprise the details between the main actions of the plot ; and for most writers , those conversations would occupy , at most , a few pages . but for james , it is the interstices between big events , the dramas , not so much of everyday events , but of the subtle daily manipulations , the unspoken victories and losses of personal relationships , which interest him and which comprise the novel . the subject of " the golden bowl " is the reciprocal marriages of father and daughter , to a pair of former lovers . the novel is about the tensions and deceptions , and the manipulations , that arise as a result . who knows what about whom ? who is responsible for what actions ? who is deceiving whom , and who has the moral authority as a consequence ? ultimately , who , if anyone , triumphs , and is their victory a hollow one ? these are the sorts of questions james is concerned with . " the golden bowl " rates as a great novel - one of the greatest of the twentieth century - because of these qualities as well as its ambiguities . it is also an enjoyable novel , but to enjoy it you must first be sympathetic to the sorts of concerns james is interested in , and you also need to be conversant in his distinctive language . both of these require - or at least i would recommend - first reading james ' earlier and middle period works . for most of us , late james can be a struggle , but one which is justified by its rewards . i do n't regard reading " the golden bowl " as an exercise only for academics , pretentious aesthetes or literary masochists , but i sympathise with those who do . giving " stars " to a james novel seems a little inappropriate ( he is beyond these kinds of simplistic judgements ) , but i have given " the golden bowl " four stars , because there are times when it strains the patience even of those who admire the writing style and enjoy the late james novels , and i prefer " the ambassadors " or " the wings of the dove " . nevertheless , " the golden bowl " is one of the great novels in english and is highly recommended to anyone who has read and enjoyed james ' other novels .

dvd neg 440.txt this joe d'amato film takes the women in prison genre one step deeper into the abyss of sleaze , bordering on pornography . the plot , or lack thereof , is typical : woman goes into jail undercover to unearth the guards corruption . to make the film last 80 minutes , joe d'amato fills the story with lesbianism , vile tortures , naked women in rat infested sewers , and plenty of gratuitous sex . i gave this movie 1 star because there is no option for a 0 star rating . even hardcore fans of euro sex queen laura gemser will find this one a total bore
software pos 92.txt nobody , and i mean nobody , could be more of an illustrator novice & ignoramus than i . several months ago i was given a licensed copy of illustrator 9 that a departing coworker had used . wanting a chance to design the departmental logo that otherwise would 've gone to an agency , i raised my figurative hand and volunteered for duty . having taught myself everything from ms-dos to turbocad , to photoshop elements , not to mention word , excel , and powerpoint ( do n't get me started on that latter program , argh ) , i figured i could tackle at least the basics of illustrator 9. loaded it on my laptop , took it home for a weekend....and just about lost my sanity - - and several fingernails - - trying to learn that confounding program . i managed to produce a few logos , one of which was chosen . but egads , what a big , stinky bear illustrator 9 was to wrestle . when i saw that cs2 had this live trace feature , i pleaded with my workplace santa to get it for me , and wow ! what an overall improvement ! ! illustrator will still not be as intuitive to pick up as an ms office product , but this comes darn close . with cs2 , they 've given us " hot tips " - - little clues about what some of the tools do , that pop up when you mouse over the tool . the intuitive menus are nice too . also cool is that all the text & paragraph and fill & stroke features , which used to be huge boxes taking up valuable real estate on the screen , are now condensed up on a small horizontal toolbar , like in the office products ... and when you mouse over them , the screen tips tell you how to expand them . aaaahh ! finally some help for dunces like me . live trace and live paint are unbelieveably cool . the very first thing i did after loading cs2 was to grab a .jpg photo of a soccer ball off google images , and within 20 minutes , without consulting any book or online help , i 'd converted it into a simple graphic image painted into the 2 colors i wanted . but as for a great guidebook , the reviewer who suggested illustrator visual quickstart guide by elaine weinmann was dead-on . i 've bought several other " highly rated " books to try to help me through the quagmire of adobe products , so i 've seen them all . the visual quickstart book does n't have any of that insufferable " wanna-be-a-comic-novel-author " writing , and focuses just on the basics . and it 's very literal , with step-by-step instructions . still there 's no substitute for the utterly excruciating process of learning illustrator through experience . but the weinmann book 's better than any i 've seen yet . the only reason i have n't given this product a 5 is because it still does n't have the intuitiveness that it needs . in that way it 's still " snobby " - - aimed at pros , not folks like me who need to do occasional stuff but not for a living . but this is a far , far , far cry better than illustrator 9. absolutely worth the money , just for live trace and live paint alone
books neg 664.txt as a beef eating hindu i am very much interested in finding how cows became holy for hindus and beef a forbidden thing to eat . i browsed through this book in a book store and found it to be very disappointing . first , it appeared to be intended more for creating controversy than for informational purposes . it clearly had a bias which turned me off . second , i am generally up-to date on current issues and remembered that it did not generate all that controversy as mentioned on the cover of the book . there were some rumblings but nothing of the sort described on the covers ( " the government of india demands be ritually burned " ) . later i searched on google with the book title and words " ban " , " government of india " and found no news reports relating any government of india attempts at banning this book . there were no reports on ban by allahabad high court either . all i found were book reviews on the book and other articles written mainly by political commentators known for their leftist opinions . third , i found some material on internet on how the author misinterpreted much of the scriptures to support his conclusions . it basically left me disappointed and i am still searching for some reliable and accurate material on this matter .

books neg 142.txt mcmurry 's text is a very friendly , gentle intro to organic . it 's a thoroughly enjoyable read , but it does n't teach you what you need to know . explanations for important mechanisms are usually very brief , and the problems included are usually very basic and general ( the spectroscopy and synthesis problems , in particular ) . if you 're looking to become a chemist , this is not the book to learn from . i 'd recommend vollhardt and schore 's textbook , or any number of sophomore-level texts that will give you the skills you need to approach complicated problems more successfully ( i.e. , on exams or out in the industry )

health neg 329.txt first , know this , it is a trimmer not a shaver ! with the included height attachment , your bound to have a little fuzz still left . without the attachment , you get closer results , but still very visible hair lines . i am quite disapointed with the product , because it runs on two aaa batteries , the motor is nearly powerful enought and will lock up sometimes when cutting hair in different angles . this lock up rips the hair out of your skin and sometimes even cuts you . i would certainly not recommend this product , but might be necessary if you 'll be traveling and need a small portable trimmer that will get more results than just letting your hair grow wild .
dvd pos 838.txt i have read many reviews stating that this remake is inferior to the orginal version of 1968. granted , that version is marvelous . i have bought both versions and love them both . ok , it is difficult not to compare when watching . but i ca n't help wondering : if this version would have been the first i or anybody watched instead of the 1968 version , if people would have been complaining about that version ? i can have different versions of vivaldi 's four seasons ca n't i ? actually for those among us who love classical music and opera it is quite common to have several versions of the same musical piece and enjoy them all ( and i do understand that people can have preferences for one or the other ) . we would never say this or that piece is a remake of that version , would we ? i have gone to the opera numerous times and watched don giovanni three times . every time with different performers . remake ? absolutely not . i think that the only reason one would have made this version of lion in winter is the wish to make it , because is such a great play . so , logically this would not be a remake ! why ca n't we watch this version for what it is and let go of the other ( splendid 1968 ) version when doing so ? that done , i must say i understand why alais is in love with king henry . patrick stewart is a very fine actor and has magnificent voice which he uses very well . he is a very good match to close 's queen . i did not care for richard , i thought he was not commanding enough , bit whiny . i think john is a difficult part to play to say the least and i did n't care for him either , too much the idiot . geoffrey on the other hand is really conniving and very good . king philippe : too much a boy , although he has moments when the interaction with king henry makes him interesting . alais:good enough . which of the versions do i prefer ? that is difficult . i have highly enjoyed both . i think the 1968 version has a sharper edge because of hepburn and i prefer her to close . this version has a more emotional and sometimes romantic ( alais and henry ) approach . i definitely prefer stewart to o'toole , who seemed too young for the role . i liked the way stewart made us see henry 's self confindence in his plans and his pleasure in manipulating and scheming ( that is , until the end , when things turn out the wrong way and you see hem falling apart ) . o'toole had a very serious approach all the time . on the other hand : anthony hopkins and timothy dalton were both splendid . i think overall that the 1968 version has a better supporting cast . which of the versions i watch , depends on the mood i am in . i think they are both good in their own way .
dvd pos 942.txt this is a thuroughly enjoyable movie ; a pleasure to watch . the acting , characters , and story are entirely plausible , and there is no grandstanding by primadonna actors , nor is there any of hollywood 's usual political preachiness ( especially unusual considering robert redford 's backing ) . the only downside to the dvd is that it is full-screen , and not letterboxed . the " bonus features " are somewhat lack-luster as well , and the menu system is laughable . only one actor 's credits have been updated since the movie was released , and the credits section is a token gesture at best . still , this is one of those cases where it is cheaper to buy the movie than rent it twice

camera pos 538.txt the panasonic pv-gs500 was discontinued in late 2006 in anticipation of panasonic 's new 2007 models which will be available in the spring . the pv-gs500 is compact , delivers stunning video in moderate lighting and above , has a lot of features that will appeal to the aspiring pro-sumer videographer . it lacks an audio output jack , which many will fault it for . it does have a separate microphone jack . the menu is driven by a toggle and is easy to use . it is reall aimed at the casual videographer who wants superb quality in a compact , uncomplicated package and it delivers precisely that . low-light performance is poor , but there is an accessory shoe , so you can mount an auxillary light . i would suggest getting an accessory bracket that provides two or three accessory shoes so you can use both a shotgun microphone and an auxillary light for weddings , parties and other group events . battery life is about what you would expect , so carrying one or two spare batteries is recommended . all in all , a very nice 3ccd camcorder for the advanced amateur or just someone who wants superb image quality in an easy-to-use package . jerr
books neg 690.txt this is a decent book on photographing artwork - - but not the the most comprehensive . the strengths of this book are that mr. saddington ( 1 ) discusses the use digital media , and ( 2 ) makes the process of photographing artwork very user-friendly by providing great visual references throughout . the user-friendly aspect is the book 's strongest selling point , especially for artists who are new or novices at photography , or visually oriented ( i.e. , no patience for reading instructions that come with few or no pictures ) . mr. saddington 's book provides pictures of what makes a bad negative exposure / photograph , and provides a concise explanation for these results , and does the same for an example of a good negative exposure / photograph . he also provides illustrations of setting up equipment and artwork for photographing . the weakness of this book lies in the general details provided ... unfortunately , mr. saddington provides a limited amount of helpful hints and leaves out specific details for for problem shooting ... i base this opinion on my comparison of this book with a book called & quot ; photographing your artwork&quot ; by russell hart . if you buy mr. saddington 's book , i 'd recommend supplementing it with the purchase of mr. hart 's book . the two books complement each other . where mr. saddington 's book lacks in details , mr. hart 's book fills in the information gaps . on the other hand , mr. hart 's book is very text heavy and has very few illustrations ... so if you 're a visually-oriented person , mr. saddington 's book would easily compensate in the area of illustrating this very important process . again , mr. saddington 's book is decent , but it should be used as a supplemental reference , especially for the visually-oriented person
books neg 873.txt the premise put forth in the title is supported by some keen insights into " leadership by calling " and comparisons to it with " modern leadership theory . " les csorba writes about the danger of pursuing results without compassion ; a point with which i agree . unfortunately , some of the examples he chooses are questionable.. . after warning about the danger of weak character in powerful leaders , csorba chastises german chancellor schroeder for turning back on some promises to george w bush regarding the war on terrorism and then goes on to deride him for his four wives . meanwhile he praises jack welch for going from neutron jack to a gentler jack ( which jack says he would abandon if needed ) while still making the " tough " decisions that got the " results " for the shareholders . jack can change is mind and go back to compassionless results.. . ok . also , there is no mention that jack was getting results with his personal secretary whilst the wife was at home.. . unfortunately the theme in csorba 's examples becomes one of bashing the mistakes of democrats and forgiving the sins of the republicans . he does sprinkle in some condemnation for a few wrong-minded republicans in a meek attempt at balance . it 's a shame that he turned this into a politcally tainted work . it started off so well . it started off well even though it will turn off readers who are not people of faith as faith is central precept to this book . it also started off well even though he chose to make george w bush the role model for how to be a trust-able leader . unfortunately this conservative / political bent turned an even harder right from there and kept going . it kept going to the point that i could no longer plan on sharing this book with some folks i know who really need it . they would simply say its a bush-ie / right-winger book and dismiss the valuable and otherwise soundly argued premise . too bad . csorba almost had a classic instead of a politically tainted leadership manual . i say this even though i am republican , am one of the few folks who would admit they were voting for bush before the election , am a person of faith , and tend to find the dems an easy target . but this book was supposed to be about so much more than republican politics . too bad
camera pos 873.txt before i get k10d , i experienced with olympus e-500 , canon xti , nikon d80. i used olympus e-500 to take lots vivid color pictures that i love very much , but no water resistance and no second display window , also only 3 focus point makes it not so enjoyable . same thing happen to canon xti , no water resistance and no second display window make it little hard to use when you need to change settings . the nikon d80 is a great camera but also have no water resistance and shake reducer build in on camera , the color tone of d80 is n't the kind that i would love . finally i bought pentax k10d , the feeling of the body , the water resistance , shake reducer , auto dust remove , vivid color tone , etc...makes me feel the k10d is the way to go . only complaint would be the limited edition lens are hard to get . get it while you can

music pos 952.txt i first heard dan singing background vocals on the jackson browne album " late for the sky " . i was 16. i went out and bought this album ( which i still have ! ! ) even though i had never heard it . i had the pleasure of seeing dan open for the eagles at the spectrum in support of this album in phila , in 1974 ; i was a junior in high school . they all joined in on " best of my love " and it just blew mw away . he had this really interesting piece of cloth on his piano . few people had heard of him prior to this album . this is by far his best album . it is more rock and roll than the rest of his sappy later work in the 80 's and a true songwriting gem . i can remember singing " morning sky " in my friend 's ford on the way to school . you have to listen to it over and over. . " someone 's been tellin ' you stories " had a sly sexual rhyme in it that was not played on radio at that time . the musicianship on this album only serve to enhance the quality of the songwriting . this was the most raw of dan 's albums , and by ar , the most superior . sadly , dan is now fighting advanced prostate cancer ( check out his website ) . let 's hope he will make a full recovery and record and tour again soon . this is a must have for anyone who is a fan of any 1970 's rock and roll .
camera neg 397.txt i have an r717 camera . i bought the dock too . each one comes with a battery and the batteries look identical . hp labels both as an r07 battery but the l1812a has squared edges running logitudinally and this feature makes it very difficult to remove from the camera . the other battery is the l1812b and is identical in every way except its edges are rounded and that makes enough difference to allow it to easily slide out of the camera . i bought a " clone " battery ( not hp ) and its edges are rounded too . maybe hp could explain the difference . just thought you would like to know
health pos 310.txt ... i purchased this item to remove some debris off my camcorder lens and found it to do the job very nicely . the microfiber texture feels nice - a little beady , but soft and textured . using it was easy , i just wiped the lens in a circular fashion with light pressure and eventually the debris was gone . ( some fingerprints and what appeared to be a scratch but was n't ) the packaging is a little subpar though . it comes in a plastic bag which you tear open at the bottom to slide the cloth out . however doing so leaves adhesive residue , which the cloth then sticks to and you have to tear it off , making those sections of the cloth appear phyically different - a bit roughed up i 'd say . this is poor design as the packaging says to store the cloth inside the bag when not in use to avoid contamination , so i used a scissor to cut the bottom of the bag with the adhesive residue off . i 've yet to machine wash it , but so far it works well . it 's just a cheap lens cleaning cloth after all
dvd neg 741.txt ...this movie is a dud . who 'd have thought that john wayne and the director of " support your local sherrif " would have joined forces for this stinker ! the characterization hints at being good , but really its character actors doing what they do best - being good support characters . its a good thing to because the duke really just mailed this one in . first - what this movie does well : -ann margaret is good and she looks great dressed up like a cowboy . -the supporting cowboy characters literally steal the show . -it is interesting that the bad guys chasing ann margaret and john wayne and his cast of cronies are never ever seen close up until the very end . when you get to the end , you learn why , but it works well to keep them faceless . -the last 10 minutes is good - top notch with a twister of an ending . however , what is wrong with the movie is stronger than what is right : -john wayne is absolutely uninspired - he is just a cardboard version of himself - a cranky , mean man who they rarely even try to develop as a character - and when they do , it seems very , very clunky . -at least 20 minutes of this movie consists of long-distance shots of people riding horses . sometimes , they ride over hills , sometimes they ride through valleys . we get 4 separate long shots of them crossing a wide pond that is supposed to be the rio grande ( the border with mexico ) . fill in this time with some character development ! some dialogue ! anything ! -the character actors keep referring to other events in the past that sound a lot more interesting than this movie . all in all , it seems like this was the rough draft of a great script that was rushed to film just so john wayne could have another movie in the theaters . too bad , a crack team of writers could have made it something special . my suggestion , get " cowboys " or either of the two " rooster cogburn " movies or " support your local sherrif " and see this actor and this director doing much better work !

camera neg 276.txt i got mine today , and it is being returned today . i had high hopes , given the reviews so far and the supposed improvement in low light sensitivity . i was hoping for an all-in-one device for stills and video . here 's my results : 1 ) stills . pictures are not too bad , but do not compare with a similar 7mp canon sd500 which i own . the zoom works well , focusing is ok , but slow . the pictures themselves have quite a bit of noticeable noise in them , flash or not , like they are all taken at a high iso setting on a regular digital cam . so slight disappointment here . 2 ) video . if this is improved low light sensitivity , i would not have liked to see the results on the hd1 ! video does not even come close to comparing to my regular sony dv camera . focusing is hit or miss , and shake is much more evident at high zoom than with my sony . i really was hoping for the be all end all combo device , but the hd2 does neither very well . ergonomically it is beautiful and fits in one hand very well . the finish is great and the buttons are well placed . but it does n't justify the price or quality misses on the photos and video themselves

books neg 175.txt i 'm really disappointed in this book , because the author seems to imply that you can have anything you want , but that is just not the case . it 's a deceptive title . i can honestly say that this book is worthless and is not going to help you ; you 're better off practising feng shui and hanging little crystals in your house than reading this book ( and i 'm not knocking feng shui , i practise it myself ) . people like the author of this book just want to make a quick buck at your expense . in the end , you 'll just feel worse off , looking for the " next big thing " to promise you some more snake oil . another fact i 'd like to point out is that this author sells this book in cd format for around $60.00 ( i got a flyer in the mail ) . if he is truly living life according to his principles why would he even charge for these so-called " secrets , " does n't that go against his own moral values ? one of the gimmicks of the cds is that you can learn the secret sound of " creation , " as if chanting " ahhhh " is going to make everything alright . thanks to dyer and others like him , i am completely against any sort of " positive thinking " guru . they are only after your money ( while you keep wishing you had more ) . *btw , you might be interested to know that after reading this book , you 're only going to find out that the big catch is that manifesting your destiny , according to the author , only applies to spiritual matters . huh ? yes . the entire book promises you can have anything you want , but it has absolutely nothing to do with material prosperity . the author also wants you to know that if your desire is not in accordance with " god 's " plan , you do n't have a chance either . thought i 'd mention that before you read this book and end up feeling cheated !

software neg 874.txt i have been using turbo tax since 1998 , i use computers every day , and ( as an engineer ) i am used to using difficult applications ( pro-e , mathcad , ug , etc ) . this years edition of turbo tax deluxe was the worst turbo tax i have ever seen ( & i usually like it very much ) . i purchased in january and had to update 4 times . one update took 6 hours ( some of us live in the boonies and broadband is not an option ) . in addition , the application brought up menus and selections that were not applicable ( farm income at the pa state form ) . when i tried to delete the entries ( at the federal level as instructed ) they would not . my 1 business expense entry kept getting duplicated ( " copy 2 " and every time i deleted it , it would reappear on the next pass through . every time i entered the " state " tab , it acted like i was never there before with a " start state " button that always lead me through all the same questions ( it did retain my answers from prior visits ) . where was the " continue state " button ? i also noticed that using the " back " button and then moving foreward again caused never before seen dialogs to occur , even though the same " foreward " choices were made . once i backed up to check something & then moving foreward caused my state tax status to jump from +$46 to - $1548 ! ! upon backing up i saw that some of the check boxes regarding the sale of my home were unchecked . i did not check them , but rather backed up two more screens , then moved foreward again the two screens and the boxes were again checked ! one more foreward click and my taxes again returned to +$46. one of the years i liked best was when there was a " checklist " so you could see where you had been and what was already addressed . this years state was definetly worse than the federal , but even that was a dissapointment . i did complete this years filings & submitted both online , i hope i do n't get burned ! turbo tax ! - - please improve for next year or it may be my last year . you realize that at 59.95 + 39.95 filing + my time + aggravation like this year , and an accountant is looking attractive . if you are on the " inside " you probably know why this is happening...outsourcing code gen to india , not outsourcing code gen to india , programmer cut-backs , programming application changes , archiving application changes , project management issues , whatever . just realize that there is a problem & fix it

music pos 682.txt i ca n't believe the harshness of some of the comments on this album . not a lot of in between among the notices - - those that hate are mean and heartless . very hurtful . lousy counterpoint to her warmth . i do n't think they understand that she does n't have to lose control to be meaningful and touching . take her as an original instead of as a mimic . what do i hear ? i love her lush voice on this album and fred hersch 's brilliant piano accompaniment . bill frisell is very good , too . i love jazz & pop as well as opera . ren ? e fleming can make it any of these genres . these songs are very much her own interpretation . they are ' deeper ' than what you 've heard before . even if i prefer nancy wilson or eva cassidy singing " you 've changed , " ren ? e fleming sings it warmly and beautifully , in her own style , and very touching , too . she 's not carried by full orchestration , mostly just fred and her . i was going to write that " my one and only love " was especially good , but as the cd kept playing , i must say that they are all especially good . enjoy

software pos 96.txt ok , sorry , i 've been vectoring line art since 1990. my current machine is an amd athlon xp with the 333 fsb , 1 gig ram & 80 gig hd shared on network & a 40 gig hd for software , os is xppro , it 's 2 years old i think . i installed three cathode ray tubes , you know ; big boxy monitors , the largest of which is a 21 inch monster right in my face all day . i read the reviews here and started " quaking " in my boots ! oops i said to myself , and i looked up my previous day 's purchases for the new artist i just hired . sure enough ; i bought cs2 for the new machine . so i downloaded the 30 day trial for illustrator cs2 upyours , i mean upgrade . replacing my old illustrator 8.01 these kids i 've been interviewing made me think i should take a look outside my cave ! so i got it loaded up and sure enough ; it takes longer to load than my old corrupted rusty buddy ; illustrator 8.01 , about twice as long . ( so leave it running ) ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! but wow ! ! ! ! ! ! ! i should have done this sooner , or should i have ? as soon as it was running illustrator cs2 auto updated itself . it wanted it 's adobe bridge fixed up . so i let it . this is just exactly what people have been complaining about . ******** the bridge is fixed ********* way super cool dude ! i keep the bridge open on the right monitor and i can drag art into illustrator cs2 at lightning speed . the whole time i get to see super big previews of all the artwork i need to work with . way better than xppro 's little thumbnails . live trace : realy nice , i think this is what these companies are using to sell vectored line art to printers like me . it is very accurate and seems to acomodate all those nasty giant pixels that up till now , took a human brain to see past while vectoring . ok , it 's not as good as a skilled craftsman such as ( full of ) myself , but for only about $160 or so , it 's like a gift from almighty god ! no crashes , no bugs , just pure inteligence from adobe once again . do n't you think of a little white mud hut in the dessert when you say adobe ? i really apreciate the object oriented work bar thing at the top , wait , let me go look at what it 's called , hmmmm , still do n't know , well it changes according to what kind of object you 've clicked on in your artwork . also this new wonder of technology solves an old problem of global color change needed for color separation work . that top task bar object oriented do-hickey is similar but better than the one in photoshop . transparent objects , looks like everything can be transparent , wow , do you know what that means ? ? ? i gotta go use it some more , it 's just way to cool . ok , i 'm back , even fonts can be transparent , .tiffs .jpgs , everything . this means way less jumping back and forth from photoshop to illustrator . but i do believe you have to be very capable with your hardware , operating system , and have at least a year ; full time with illustrator and photoshop to fully appreciate the thought and creative potential that adobe has opened up for us

music neg 584.txt first bill has never nor will he ever be a jazz musician . it seems that those who branch out and play multiple styles are often lauded for expanding the vocabulary . here 's what chaps my hide the most . bill has somehow captured the attention of hordes of budding guitarist with their effect pedals all strung out as if they were getting ready for a space shuttle launch . it burns me too no end when a person calls himself a & quot ; jazz&quot ; guitarist , but does n't really have any chops . i know bill has been called anti-technique , but what does that really mean ? would you want a heart transplant performed by a surgeon that means well , but really is n't very good at what he / she does ? this guy is getting built up as something new and it seems every time i turn around someone that knows absolutely nothing about jazz guitar is throwing this guy in my face . i 've been a professional jazz guitarist for 12 years and teaching for 8 years . when i have guys that actually debate me that bill is somehow doing more interesting things than say pat martino , or that bill could somehow hang in a jam session with someone like pat martino , i have to shake my head in disbelief in how twisted and mixed up this world has become when charlatans are giving more credit than someone like pat who has been on the road for years and paid dues that frisell could n't imagine . is bill frisell a jazz musician , no ! maybe if the guy could woodshed for a dozen years he 'd come up with something . for me i 'll stick with the guys that really know how to play......johnny smith , peter leitch , jim hall , pat martino , kenny burrell , billy bauer , tal farlow , lenny breau , jimmy bruno , jimmy raney , wes montgomery and so on

dvd neg 763.txt if you have not read the book , then this movie may intrigue you . it is quirky and interesting to say the least . as a storyline it does not lack imagination . from maine to vienna to nyc and back to maine , from the jew-hating german tourists to the radicals and the [...] , from one hotel new hampshire to another , the dreams of a father and his colourful family unfold in a series of bizarre and at times disturbing events . and life appears to be a fairy tale that we live as we chase our dreams . now , in relation to the actual book , this movie can be described with just one word : rushed . the adaptation is so faithful that it tries to cover almost everything , all characters and all events , thereby failing miserably to project the sentiment behind the eccentric story of this highly unusual family . i could go on and on about how the accurate quotes from the original text fall flat on a screenplay that comes across truncated and patched together clumsily , how the scenes lack emotional depth , how the characters are not given enough time to be adequately developed.. . but i will instead characterise the whole attempt as noble but short . if the book was a long wave-like function , with a rise to a crest , then a drop followed by a building surge and another rise to another crest , over and over and over again , then the movie was just a cross-section of the top parts of this rollercoaster of a wave-like function , shaving off all the crests and placing them in a two hour blender , where they were shaken and served to please god knows what . surely not the potential of this fascinatingly bizarre book , nor its undercurrent and extremely subtle magical tone . and it was not for lack of effort . it was for lack of realism on how to put on screen a highly bizzare story in a way that flows smoothly rather than jump spastically between scenes . a mini series would have worked much better for such a faithful adaptation . either that or a more free-flowing interpretation that could possibly make sense within the 120 minutes that are usually allocated to a motion picture . thank god for jodie foster 's and beau bridges 's performances , who bring fanny and win berry to life . keep passing the open windows and read the book for a much richer and meaningful experience . as far as this movie is concerned , just toss it out as far as you can . and if you are to keep it , then do so to remind yourselves of how to not adapt a great book onto the screen . this is the only reason why i keep mine
music neg 47.txt i do n't understand the previous reviews - i found this recording positively dreadful , with ruthie henshall being the only one worth listening to . john sinclair is abominable as george - he sounds like he 's doing a ( bad ) imitation of michael crawford in & quot ; hello , dolly . &quot ; he does strange things to his words - i guess he 's trying not to sound british , but why is he singing & quot ; summ-ar weath-ar&quot ; instead of & quot ; summer weather&quot ; ? the ilona is a bass - almost literally . & quot ; i resolve&quot ; has been lowered for her , and yet she still cannot master the range of the song . to accomodate her , the second part of & quot ; i do n't know his name&quot ; has a truly odd key change . were she remotely talented i could understand key changes to facilitate her singing , but she 's not worth it . the orchestrations are odd , too , with strange sleigh bell sounds appearing frequently . the rest of the singers range from fair ( kodaly - a pretty voice but not much expression ) to bad ( mr. maraczek drags down every single note of & quot ; days gone by . &quot ; luckily this is his only song . ) the broadway revival , to my ear , still has the best voices , except , of course , that barbara cook ( the original ) outshines diane fratantoni , who is merely good ( but who was a vast improvement over the roundabout 's original amalia , the annoying judy kuhn . ) get the original or revival recordings instead - this london version i would recommend only to die-hard she loves me fans , or masochists . i 'd rather sit through another terrible viewing of & quot ; you 've got mail&quot ; than listen to this again

" searching for bobby fischer " is an excellent family film for all . i am living proof that even those who do n't know jack about chess will love this movie . it is a movie not just about chess , but about acceptance , the bond of love and friendship , compassion for others , and not being afraid to be who you want to be . the balance of drama with edge-of-your-seat competition makes this a truly remarkable film . max pomeranc plays the young and sensitive josh waitzkin , a pint-sized seven-year old with a cute lisp , who becomes fascinated with the " lower class " men playing chess in a new york park . he watches the men , his eyes shifting with each move of the pieces . he convinces his mother to go to the park with him , where he plays a game of chess with an older gentleman . it is there that josh 's mother realizes her son has a knack for chess . also noticing josh is the fast-talking park chess player , vinnie ( a funny and great performance from laurence fishburne ) who befriends the boy and eventually teaches him a thing or two about the game . after a match with josh , josh 's father ( played by joe mantegna ) realizes his son 's special gift and enlists the help of a stern but knowledgeable chess teacher named bruce ( played by ben kingsley ) to make josh an even better chess master . bruce sees a young bobby fischer in josh and cannot resist the temptation to take him under his wing and perhaps fill the void that bobby fischer left in the country after his mysterious disappearance . through all the technical strategies of the game being learned , josh and bruce develop a good friendship and with bruce 's help , combined with his own special gift , josh excels in chess tournaments and collects a shiny bundle of trophies . but there may be a test even harder than becoming a grand master of chess . we 've all heard of parents trying to live their dreams through their children , especially when a parent sees a special gift in their child . but what happens when the thrill of competition and the persistent need to win cloud the parents ' mind too much ? and what happens when a beloved teacher wants you to be a carbon copy of someone or something that you 're not ? these are tests that run way deeper for josh waitzkin than any chess tournament . josh learns quickly how addictive competition is and how obsessed people can become with a certain game . in his own way , the insightful josh shows his father and teacher that he is not one of these people who lives and breathes chess like bobby fischer did . in the process , josh pushes his father and teacher 's feelings about him and the game of chess to the brink where they find they have to rethink their feelings . it 's a matter of what is more important : chess competition , or love ? through it all , the three of them find that they can tolerate losing at chess but cannot tolerate losing something more dear ; love and friendship for each other no matter what . there are some truly touching scenes in the film from the lecture josh receives from his dad in the pouring rain , to the visit from his teacher at the chicago tournament which comes toward the end of the show . but amongst the competition and drama , there are some nice comic scenes from vinnie 's trash talking against the others in the park , to the scene where the all the parents are literally locked up away from their kids during a tournament because they are so obnoxious , to the humorous appearance by william h . macy when he offers to get josh 's dad a tuna sandwich . the climax comes in the huge chess championship at the end of the film where josh takes bruce and vinnie 's teachings along with his own style of playing and faces off against another chess prodigy named jonathan . jonathan is a boy i feel sorry for in the film . playing since he was four years old , all jonathan knows is chess and goes about life with a glazed expressionless look on his face . perhaps this boy is proof of what living for a game can do to you , especially when you cannot just be a kid . the acting is terrific . ben kingsley , max pomeranc and joe mantegna give us a very touching and real performance in this film . it 's too bad that pomeranc did not act much since this film because he was a great little actor and very convincing . a nice touch to the movie is the real black and white film clips of a very young bobby fischer talking about and playing chess with pomeranc narrating along . it gives us a bit of the history of the world 's greatest chess player and also gives us the implication that people were searching for a new chess hero to fill the void when bobby fischer vanished ; enter josh waitzkin . " searching for bobby fischer " is one of those stand-up-and-cheer films that is perfect fun for the whole family with some valuable lessons to be learned as well ! this is a movie you 'll want to watch time and time again .

books neg 424.txt i have been slogging through this book for weeks now , it was a terrible shock to the system after john julius norwich 's excellent book on byzantium . the book lacks any narrative thrust , often stopping and retreading events slightly out of chronological order and frequently bringing all forward motion to a halt by describing the intricacies of some bureaucratic office or another . the one consistent thing throughout this book is the author 's obvious agenda to " set the record straight " and prove that the ottoman empire was far superior to its " barbaric " european contemporaries

music pos 631.txt yeah , johnny must 've been drinking heavily during this recording . it 's evident in his slurred lyrics...it 's raining is the song where he sounds totally wasted , although you can get the sense that he is infact quite happy and very relaxed . but all this inebriation actually adds to the authenticity of this c.d.- -- - johnny winter really becomes the archetypal bluesman on this c.d. his guitar work is quite sparse , no long solos on this one but , nevertheless , the feel on this album is wonderful . i have to say this also..johnny must 've been very , very brave to release this album back in 1977. that was a very bad year for the blues , appalling infact...disco music was king . alot of bluesmen , like johnny guitar watson etc were opting for the commercialism of the disco dance floor . johnny might 've thought of releasing a commercial type rock album , like edgar was doing . instead he chose to stay faithful to the blues and i have to admire the determination and resolve of johnny winter . very few would 've stayed faithful to the blues . the last track with muddy waters ..walking thru the park...captures johnny in his element . he was so happy back then and it filters over into the song itself . i remember seeing them both do this song live at the capitol radio festival , alexander palace , london / england in july 1977. never again to be repeated , sadly

camera pos 725.txt this camera is very similar to the fuji f30 , but has face detection ( fd ) that autofocuses on faces in a photo . great for taking pictures of yourself , or for snapshots you do n't have time to compose . excellent quality photos in dim light . at 3200 iso , photos are washed out and noisy , but still good for capturing an image you would otherwise miss . option to limit iso to 1600 , or to 400. camera will use any speed up to the limit . 400 iso is extremely good . as good as my canon digital rebel xti . usual modes i never use ( flower , landscape , etc. ) , but one unique mode i use all the time : no flash / flash . the camera takes a picture without flash up to 3200 iso , and then takes a picture with flash immediately after . usually takes less than one second to capture both images . no flash does n't surprise anyone and ruin the candid shot , while the following flash guarantees you 'll get the image , even if the " warm glow of candlelight " is ruined . i always have the camera set to this mode . uses xd cards , which i hate , but if you buy a 1 gb card you 'll be able to take 400 - 500 photos without ever needing to change the card . also , battery life is unbelieveable ! fully charge the camera over several hours , and you 'll be able to take 400 photos , half with flash , before the battery is drained . fuji-brand underwater housing is optional , watertight to 40m ( 121 ft . ) camera comes with underwater setting to intensify non-blue colours , and still keep the intense blue of the water . literally *every* diver should have one of these cameras . i recommend this camera without hesitation . there simply is n't anything else like it on the market .

dvd neg 546.txt i was disappointed with this longer version of the mill on the floss . i thought , being bbc and a long version it would be a definitive one , but i have to agree with the other reviewer . this version left out some very important events , and emotions seemed washed out rather than passionate and moving . i like long movies , but this dragged because it just does n't hold your attention . the 1997 masterpiece theatre version is so much more powerful , and keeps all important events intact , spending less time on maggie 's mother worrying about the fate of her china , and more on character and plot development , with a very haunting score . i really hope the other version is released on dvd-if so , i will probably donate this one to the library , because i ca n't quite see myself rewatching it . i would rather read the book , instead

dvd pos 937.txt just today i randomly selected a movie , that movie was " henry " . i had never heard of it before , and i figured that i was in for your average , run-of-the-mill low budget slasher flick . though it is low budget , it is by no means your ordinary serial killer movie . in fact , the gritty film and minimalist effects only adds to the stark realism of this nightmarish character study . meet henry , a very quiet and serene man with vacant and staring eyes as well as a calm disposition . watch as he goes to work , watch as he hits the bar with his buddy otis , and watch as he calmly and systematically butchers random people . this film does not exploit the violence though ; it is very frank and direct , treating it as though henry were doing nothing more than cleaning the dishes or taking a stroll in the park . this movie is a lot of things , and when it was all over , i just had to sit back and take a few breaths , have a cigarette - and try to gauge my reaction ( s ) . i was surprised to note that while this film is disturbing , it is also pretty funny in some parts , though only funny in the blackest sense of the term . there is no social commentary in this movie , nor does it provide any closure . the dvd is great , awesome extras including fragmented interviews with the genuine serial killer henry lee lucas , awaiting lethal injection on death row . very fascinating
books pos 769.txt after a quick internet search i found many reviews on amazon as well as several other sites for this book and called in an order for it at my local barnes & noble that same night . dr. whitley has written this book in the most responsible and informative way without having to charge his readers for individual sessions ! in my opinion this is a must read not only for parents of underachievers but also teachers and counselors . we have always tried to stress the same learning structure and goals as the teachers . however , if at home you are on dr. whitley 's 10-step track and the teachers are still on a reward and punishment system - the parent needs to be proactive in dealing with the teachers and endeavor to obtain their support as a united front . although the steps may seem to be a cumbersome process at first read and initial implementation - the constant image of " mr. rogers " in the back of my mind is quite calming and thus the process can become a destressor for the parents . of course , that may not be so for those parents of hard cases where the child is at the stage where he / she is capable of " frightening " resistance . obviously , professional help with someone in-tuned with dr. whitley 's methods would be more advisable than his book ! to me - this book is for the parents of students in 6th grade or less - and possibly 7-8th graders . these kids still have some moldability and are n't as likely to have other serious issues that could be the source of the problem ( i.e. depression ) . for the grammatically correct - the substance of the content of the book far outweighs any such errors that are more the fault of the editors than the author ; 0 )
music neg 282.txt i understand why the beatles are the top sellers in rock music as they suck . they only made about two decent songs in their " hey jude " a pretty song , and " ballad of john and yoko " . the sixties was a horrible decade of rock music . i would have to be said that only very few good songs came out in the sixties , which one of them is neil young 's " down by the river " . i have listened to the beatles for about a month and thought how lame and pathetic their music was . they were hugely one of the most overrated bands of all time . this one album is definately not the album to buy at all unless you are a sick moron who does not have a good taste in music . here you will get 25 of the worst songs ever recorded . if you want good music , i recommend go buy albums from foreigner , dire straits , green day , guns n ' roses , and metallica insted . do n't buy this album at most costs as you will waste money on 25 awful songs
software neg 821.txt i bought vista to get the inevitable familiarity over with as early as possible and what i discovered was an operating system not even close to being compatible yet . half if not 80% of all routers are not vista-ready yet , so you ca n't get a network running for at least a few more months . any accesories you own with your system no longer work unless they 're compatible. . ( ie , printers , scanners , burners , etc ) so you not only buy an operating system , you have to buy an entirely new set of hardware to go with it . majority of my programs did not work with vista , be it adobe software , maya , poser and god forbid any games you own like warcraft . for the expense and complete hassel , it 's not worth owning until eveything is " ready " ( which will probably be a year from now ) save your money . - i returned my copy

software pos 132.txt i wo n't include my website url here , but i 'm a professional photographer , who displays and sells his work at juried exhibitions . i 've been using photoshop since version 5.0 , roughly 6-7 years . frankly , i 'm surprised to see how many negative reviews there are here of photoshop cs2 , and that overall the product only gets three stars . i understand all the frustration , though . even on a top-of-the-line machine , " ps cs2 " can be slow at times . however , in my case , that 's because i 'm working on incredibly large files . for example , my camera / scanner combination typically produces 50 megapixel images . by the time multiple layers are added in ps , one image file can be 500 mb - 1 gb in size . this is exactly why i have a dual-opteron system with 4 gb of ram : so i can work on these monster files in photoshop ! for me , photoshop is a must-have . there are *no* alternative programs for me to consider that can handle my files and do what i want to get done . i do n't even want to mention all the advanced features that i use on a daily basis , frankly because that 's part of my edge as a professional . i 've spent over five years working in ps everyday , and have carefully studied several advanced books on ps . the learning curve is long , but the rewards are great if you have high goals and high standards . yeah , adobe 's got some major improvements to make , along the lines that other reviewers have mentioned . for me , the only real problem is poor and often wasteful use of system memory . and i would agree with other reviewers here that for most people , the full photoshop cs2 is probably a waste of money . photoshop elements is probably a better way to go , though i have n't used it personally . i know a good web designer who uses paint shop pro , and who seems to be happy . imho , some people are probably drawn to photoshop the way others are drawn to autocad or solidworks or 3d studio max . all these programs are incredibly powerful tools that can support an entire career if one puts in the time and effort to become a true expert user . you ca n't make a career out of ps elements , or paint shop pro , or gimp , or whatever else other reviewers may mention . ps cs2 is " the standard " for image manipulation
camera neg 733.txt i really wanted to love this camera . the camera is compact and could fit into the pocket of my jeans ! i did plenty of research before choosing to buy this camera so i expected all the quarks of the unit mentioned in other reviews . the 30 frames per second uninterlaced video is good - of course it 's not as good as full resolution 60 fields per second video.. . but the unit fits into my pocket ! another huge plus is that each " shot " is an individual file that can be dragged off the unit and onto a pc using a usb cable . no further processing - the file just copies and plays in quicktime , etc. another great feature is the ability to zoom while recording a movie , which most point and shoot cameras that record video will not allow you to do . now the sad part ; amazon has shipped me two units - both with bad pixels on the lcd and ccd . the bad pixels on the lcd , according to the manual , are expected and " not a malfunction " ; i disagree with that . for the cost of the unit there should be no bad pixels on the lcd monitor . the huge problem is the bad pixels on the ccd ! this results with white pixels being recorded on the files ; this is compounded by the " image stabilization " . the image stabilization shifts the image the ccd receives around in attempt to stabilize a shot of video - and it works great ! however , as the video is shifted and stabilized the white pixels are shifted around the screen as well . it 's almost like there are flies moving through every single shot you record . the bad ccd is the reason why i ca n't love the c6... i gave up hope and sent both back to amazon . i 'm not sure what i will buy now .

camera neg 65.txt i have had this camera since jan ' 05 and have so far taken approximately 10 , 000 shots while on trips and at weddings . do n't expect much from it and you will be happy . as an entry level dslr it does what it 's supposed to do in ideal conditions . i find it 's strength is in taking people photographs in bright light , provided that they are not moving . cons : in landscape photography this camera is lacking - both due to inadequate megapixels and it 's inability to capture the natural blues and greens very well . battery dies fast . the battery i got with it hardly lasts a whole day of shooting , especially when shooting in raw mode . i have yet to fill up a 1gig card when shooting in raw mode ( approx 150 shots ) before the battery dies . surprisingly when shooting jpegs , i get more shots per charge ( over 300 ) but hardly enough to last a day . i cannot tell you the number of times the battery has died on me while i was out on a hike . so i always carry a backup film camera ( my trusty elan 7 ) . the viewfinder is very dim . when i look through my elan 7 and then through the 300d , it is painfully obvious how dark the image is through the 300d 's viewfinder . in indoor situations with low light this becomes a handicap , especially when having to resort to manual focus . autofocus in low light for the 300d is terrible . when shooting indoors , the autofocus hunts and ends up focusing on something behind your intended subject . i have lots of beautiful photos of walls and sconces in the background in sharp focus while the people standing in front in the middle of the frame are an out of focus blur . this is despite having a 420ex flash on my camera that uses an infrared beam to assist with the focus . the 420ex flash is supposed to " talk " to the camera and adjust the power in order to ensure the subjects are not over or under exposed . however , with the 300d , this is a crap shoot at best and many of my indoor shots are over / under exposed . after about five months , the shutter button started sticking . i would click it and then it would remain depressed . the shutter button would only pop back up after i jiggled it a little . another annoying thing about the camera is that the settings are displayed on the rear of the camera and not on the top beside the shutter button . and since there is only one thumbwheel , it is not easy to change aperature and shutter speed . for example , if you use the thumbwheel to change the aperature , then to change the shutter speed you would have to press another button while at the same time turning the thumbwheel . when you take thousands of shots over the life of the camera , this is a real annoyance . so would i recommend this camera : if you are a casual point and shoot person , it 's an affordable entry into dslrs that produces decent photos . but if you plan on shooting a lot indoors or want to take landscape photographs that can actually convey the colors accurately , look elsewhere

dvd neg 622.txt this is a review of the dvd , not the world series . please save your comments re the series for the sports blogs . in this day and age , for major league baseball to produce a non-anamorphic dvd is absolutely pathetic . this dvd was made for a widescreen tv ( 16:9 ratio ) , but cannot take advantage of it , because it is non-anamorphic , meaning it will not take up the full widescreen . it has black bars on all four sides . they may as well have made it full screen instead , with a 4:3 ratio . also , in its rush to make a lot of money by getting the dvd out quickly , they decided not to include footage from the season , to show nothing of the tigers ' play-off run , and to provide mostly filler with worthless interviews from players . ( " gee , was it exciting to be out on the mound ! " ) i am an avid cardinals fan , but this dvd was not worth the $14.99 i paid for it . major league baseball , as usual , cheats its fans . another lesson they fail to learn from pro football

books neg 946.txt susanna rowson 's & quot ; charlotte temple&quot ; is not the first novel and certainly not the last to deal with the topic of the morally fallen woman . poor , pitiful charlotte finds herself in the midst of an immoral and unforgiving world where one transgression sends her on the road to permanent ruin . rowson encases her heroine charlotte temple within a world of virtue and vengeance . charlotte has no possible means of escaping her inevitable fate because the author / narrator makes it clear from the onset that she has written this story as a lesson to young woman . she has no real interest in charlotte as a dimensional character . charlotte simply serves as a symbol of lost virtue and symbols do not have real emotions or feelings . & quot ; charlotte temple&quot ; was written in 1794 and became one of the first best sellers of the newly formed america . a morally abhorrent woman who pays for her sins almost always guaranteed a best seller in the eighteenth century and now & quot ; charlotte temple&quot ; has been rediscovered and published in a scholarly press edition . was this reclamation of charlotte really necessary ? in the past twenty years , feminist scholars have rediscovered authors and texts that have gone out of print or been totally ignored by the literati . authors such as anne plumptre , frances burney , aphra behn , sarah fielding and charlotte lennox have been dusted off and given new literary lives . feminist scholar cathy davidson has taken charlotte temple in hand and aims to join rowson to the above list of rediscoveries . unfortunately , rowson does not warrant such treatment . rowson has a flat , humorless approach to the fallen woman story . unlike burney 's & quot ; evelina&quot ; or & quot ; camilla , & quot ; rowson does not imbue her narrative with needed levity . her pedantic iron-fisted preaching smothers the modern reader in a moral morass that confounds rather than illuminates . in many of the fallen women stories , authors would use the genre as a subversive technique to criticize the patriarchal structures . rowson does engage in such subversion within the novel . she seeks to preach to the young women who may fall victim to the unscrupulous man - - in england and america , it was not considered altogether lady-like to read a novel , so rowson would be preaching to young women who had already transgressed . rowson does not criticize men within the novel . she does not censure montraville for taking charlotte as his mistress , impregnating her and abandoning her for a wealthier woman . when he believes that charlotte has becomes his best friend 's mistress , he does not believe that she would soil her reputation even though she has ruined her life by engaging in an illicit affair with him . he aims to enact revenge upon the friend for acting & quot ; dishonorable&quot ; against her . yet if he had not acted dishonorably towards her , she would not have been reduced to a penniless , pregnant ex-mistress scrounging the streets for food and shelter . he never takes responsibility for his role in charlotte 's downfall . rowson had the perfect opportunity for savage criticism of the patriarchy with montraville but she fails to take it . instead , rowson places the blame for charlotte 's ruin on the women within the novel . when charlotte leaves the safe bosom of her morally upstanding family , she enters into the deviant world of the female who fail to protect her from licentious men . madame du pont errs in judgment by hiring the morally loose miss la rue . madame du pont sets charlotte 's downfall in action . rowson does not punish the ignorant madame du pont by killing her , she ends up an hysterical mess after the montraville / charlotte & quot ; elopement . &quot ; miss la rue , the woman who pushes charlotte into the arms of montraville , must be punished for being a promiscuous woman . she ends up poor and begs for her last scrap of food . she ends up dying painfully as rowson takes the opportunity to lecture her readers on the improper behavior of loose women . why would modern readers want to read this ? i do not think any intelligent would reader would want to subject themselves to the depressing experience of reading this novel . at 125 pages , it seemed to progress at such an excruciating pace . no character has any shadings . there are no subplots to divert the attention from the static charlotte . rowson does nothing to keep our interest . unfortunately rowson has become a heroine to feminist scholars for her feat as the first american woman to have a best-selling novel . that accomplishment is noteworthy as literary trivia , but it does not make for engaging reading
dvd neg 104.txt i was so disappointed in this film . the only reason i gave it 2 stars is because of the heart and soul terrance howard put into his acting . i love terrance , he is an outstanding actor but seeing him playing a pimp was just embarrassing . he did an excellent job with the acting but i would have much rather seen him portraying marvin gaye . call me naive but is pimping still actually going on in memphis , tennessee in this day and time ? and did terrance howard give ludacris ' character a cassette tape to listen to ? not a cd , a tape . i probably would have flushed it down the toilet too . and the hook to that song , " you know it 's hard out here for a pimp . " ya think ? with prostitution being illegal in the state of tennessee and all . i found myself cringing and sliding down in my seat in the theatre when she began to sing because i was so embarrassed . do n't get me wrong , i love my black people but sometimes when we get a chance to make a major motion picture we just do n't quite bring it , do we ?

" the ' chorus ' to " devil 's slide " sounds as sinister as its name suggests and " attack " is as close to a musical sci-fi battle as i 've ever heard . to top it off , the album includes " until we say goodbye , " one of satch 's best ballads in his entire catalogue . if you 're willing to put a little more mental energy into appreciating the work satch put into this album than just waiting for the album to rock your socks off surfing with the alien-style , you 'll find that there 's an incredible amount of depth - - and musicianship - - to be found . it 's not a satriani masterpiece , but its a true testament to the man 's enduring creativity

dvd pos 283.txt joe versus the volcano is a rare blend of comedy and insight that 's romantic enough for girls , funny enough for guys , with effective visual symbolism , and appropriate for the whole family . maybe it could be described as an allegory for escaping the drudgery of life , or something like that , but at any rate it 's pleasant to watch , at times profound , at other times funny . the beginning 3rd is about joe ( tom hanks ) struggling with hypochondria and a lousy , really crummy job , primarily because of the dreary work environment and the typical ( oppressive ) supervisor ( dan hedaya ) . ( i 've been there myself , when i worked at pines mfg h&h tooling and again at toro , where everyone was on dope . ) joe learns from his doctor ( robert stack , of the untouchables ) that he has a " brain cloud " and only a few months to live . the tone of the movie rises as joe quits his job and we feel like impending death is the best thing that 's ever happened to him . he takes a former co-worker ( meg ryan ) to dinner and seems to wake up to life for the first time . the next day billionaire lloyd bridges ( airplane ) enters joe 's life with a bizarre proposition : since he 's dying anyway , why not literally jump into a volcano - for the billionaire 's own financial motive - and live it up with unlimited credit at the his expense in the meantime . joe accepts and in his journey to the volcanic island learns about how to live life from helpful chauffeur ossie davis ( the client ) and the billionaire 's two daughters - both played by meg ryan ( sleepless in seattle ) , which makes a total of 3 roles for her in this great movie , making it even more pleasant to watch
music neg 619.txt i like these guys alot.i own a bunch of there stuff and love to see them live . i played this cd a few times liked it at first , but it did n't grow on me at all liked i 'd hoped.to cute for me , not spontaneous enough.i feel this cd will be just another dust collector in a short period of time.just let it rip guys , that 's what you do best.thank god my brother bought this instead of me.i bought live at cow palace ( the dead ) great cd
music neg 747.txt hmm.. . ok , maybe it was not the best reason to want to buy this cd , but i heard one of the songs on it , hashkiveynu , performed ( partially ) during an episode of the west wing , and it sounded amazing ( it was not the same cantor as on this cd ) . i am not jewish and not even very spiritual , but i wanted to have that song in my collection . i immediately searched the web for the info , got the name of the chant and found this cd . i almost purchased it without listening , when i found a different site , where they actually have rather long excerpts ( 2 min . ) of most tracks , so i listened to them . boy , was i relieved and disappointed at once ! relieved that i did n't buy the cd and disappointed that i could n't get the song i wanted ( i was willing to buy a whole cd for just 1 song , that 's how much it impressed me ) . the song sounds very little like the one from the west wing , although i do believe that the site where i found the info speficially pointed to this cd as having a recording of the same song used in the show . and i 'm sorry to say it but the voice also does n't hold a candle to the one used on the show - way too " operatic " , as mentioned by many , and harsh and even unpleasant-sounding to me . it took all the charm and candor right out of the song ( in the show , they had a much more natural voice do the song ) . i also agree that the choir does not mesh well with the soloist . if anyone knows where and if i can purchase a recording of this song done by a different singer ( if it can be the one from the west wing , i 'll be thrilled ) , please , let me know . in the meantime , i 'm passing on this cd. .

camera neg 580.txt even though amazon specifically recommended this bag for the panasonic lumix ( dmc-fz20pp ) camera , and even though i had to return it because it was too small , and even though my camera does not appear on the compatibility list shown in another customer 's review , amazon annoyingly continues to recommend this bag for my camera . to add insult to injury , amazon tried to deduct shipping from my refund by claiming that the error was not their fault . ( it took two emails to get the full refund , and that was even after i put a large message in my return box not to deduct shipping - - aargh ! ) regarding the bag itself , construction seemed sound and this might be a good bag for a small point-and-click camera that requires no accesories
music neg 748.txt i 'd like to second some of the other reviewers ' reviews of this album . it really lacks the energy and the coherence of the previous album . the tracks in general are a little slower . the production quality is overall about the same , but it is just not as " listenable " as believe was . the exception i find on the album is the " club mix " of " turn it around . " but if we think about that for a second , are n't we talking about " club music " here afterall ? are we under any pretenses that this is elevator or lobby music ? i should think not . what we expect from this band , and from a second album is an equal or better effort at club music . house-ish , trance-ish , and anthemic . it 's just missing on turn it around . i wholeheartedly recommend believe , but i 'd steer clear of this one unless you find it used .

dvd pos 624.txt with season 4 the series starts to slide a little . i do n't think the show is weaker , it 's just that how long can you watch a story before it starts to seem like you been there done that already ? look , i love the godfather one and two , but three is just not as good . the total time it takes to watch the first two godfather films is a little over 5 hours ! that wo n't even get you through season one of the sopranos . i hope i speak for everyone out there when i say that as good as the sopranos is , it will never come closed to the godfather movies . so i guess it is just starting to get old . i will certainly be watching the finale episodes , i just hope it is n't too big a let down . for those who are interested the dvd set has great transfers , but few interesting extras

books neg 347.txt " ha ha ha hah ha hah ! " that 's stirling laughing all the way to the bank . or at least i hope that 's what he is doing . but sadly i suspect he more likely feels his wiccan / sca / dnd-infused vision of a post-apocalyptic society is a reasonable , nay , likely path we 'll follow should selective physical laws break down . quick ! stop me ! i feel the need to wave my sword , sing a gaelic song , and break out my cauldron ! the genre requires we make a leap of faith . and as a fan of the genre , i do so willingly . but having made the leap , it is annoying at best to be forced through this " tolkein as faith " drivel . but as i will likely read the entire series ( remember , i love the genre ) i have to hope that stirling leans towards the " thanks for the buck buddy " and is himself laughing at us all . but a picture is worth a thousand words and his mug on the inside cover tells me he believes this nonsense ! my recommendation ? read the book . laugh a bit . maybe laugh a lot . but do this with the library 's copy , not one you paid for

music neg 300.txt the " drummer " ( more like " the anti-drummer " ) on this is johnny cresci . he is maddeningly lacking in even basic garage band ability , and literally has no idea what a 6 / 8 blues meter is . how he landed on the same stage with these legends may be the musical mystery of all time . for me , mr. " clueless " cresci makes it nearly impossible to enjoy the brilliant performances going on despite his anti-rhythmic upchucking.....kinda like driving an aston martin with a flat tire ! i have tried to get beyond cresci 's chops for over a year of listening now , and i simply ca n't do it . if you 're a musician , his playing will make you extremely agitated . i 'm gonna have to trade this in , and go on listening to live adventures like i have for the past 37 years . this would have been much better with the drum tracks totally muted on the 6 / 8 numbers . granted , this is an historically significant release , but i think it should have stayed in the vault , or released with johnny cresci having been digitally removed or replaced

dvd pos 889.txt how families fall apart and mend themselves is the point of this star-laden 1996 movie , but stage and tv director jerry zaks , screenwriter scott mcpherson , and a trio of fine performances transcend the formulaic aspects to come up with something more resonant . based on a play by mcpherson before he succumbed to aids , the semi-autobiographical plot focuses on two estranged , middle-aged sisters . in florida , mousey spinster bessie has spent twenty years as caretaker to their ailing father marvin and their eccentric aunt ruth . in ohio , lee escaped family responsibility to get married and raise two sons in ohio only to see things fall apart . lee is on the verge of turning her life around as a licensed cosmetologist when bessie is diagnosed with leukemia and reaches out to lee and her sons as potential bone-marrow transplant candidates . the rest of the movie is mainly about how the sisters cope with each other when they reunite and what they do to deal with the inevitable . intriguingly , while the soap opera elements are strictly by-the-numbers , there is a persistent undercurrent of black comedy that effectively blunts the potential sentimentality of the piece . it also helps that meryl streep and diane keaton play the sisters . as the embittered , guilt-ridden lee , streep moves easily back into blue-collar , silkwood territory , and she unapologetically shows the edginess and jealousy of her self-centered character . however , it 's a vanity-free keaton who really radiates as bessie finding inner strength and contentment under increasingly dire circumstances . a year before " titanic " , leonardo di caprio effectively plays the last of his juvenile hellions as lee 's oldest son hank , a textbook example of teenaged , pyromaniac angst . the rest of the cast is fine in limited turns - robert deniro ( one of the producers as well ) as the bumbling dr. wally ; dan hedaya as his even more pixilated brother bob ; gwen verdon as wild-eyed , soap opera-obsessed aunt ruth ; hal scardino as hank 's self-controlled little brother charlie ; and hume cronyn , who is forced to play marvin with severely limited expression . there are predictable moments throughout , but some surprise and a few actually enthrall , including a seriocomic scene of quiet reconciliation when bessie recalls the drowning death of her open-mouthed carny boyfriend . there are no extras with the 1999 dvd release

health pos 405.txt these wipes are strong , have just the right amount of moisture , and do n't leave that slimy feeling that most of the major brands leave . my son had diaper rashes as a newborn ; when we were at home , we could wash / rinse him with water and dry completely before rediapering , but when we were out , and had to use wipes , his rash would flare up . after switching to these wipes and 7th gen diapers , the rash went away . later on , i tried pampers again , and the rash came back . using seventh gen really has kept his skin rash free . my older son also has a lot of itching when we use pampers ; much less with these wipes & diapers
dvd neg 774.txt as a character movie this is largely a failure , unless you find poignancy in " average-ness . " the characters are all one-note half-stereotypes who seem to be sleeping their way through the non-existent plot . " oh , look how average they are ! is n't it charming how they sit around and talk about nothing ? it 's so lifelike ! " and the main character 's seeming inability to be anything other than perfectly angelic at all times makes it awfully hard to sympathize with her . if this is intended to be an issue movie with the message robert ebert has suggested ( that anti-abortion laws are really just a form of discrimination against poor women ) , it 's taking a rather belabored approach just to tell us what anyone with a head on their shoulders already knows . munich and syriana also " bring to light " ideas that are not new or novel or shocking to anyone who cares to be informed and think about the world . perhaps the only thing truly shocking is that movies like this would need to be made to say such obvious things . perhaps next they 'll make a movie to make the point that , shockingly enough , the sky is blue , or that paint dries when applied to walls , or that grass grows . i imagine they 'd be somewhat more interesting than this effort

books pos 154.txt " the case for faith " is the weakest volume in a strong series . strobel 's format is fun and engaging . i find his books as " un-put-downable " as any blockbuster page-turner . strobel holds a degree from yale law school , and he was an award-winning legal editor at the chicago tribune . he begins with a question : " does historical evidence support the historicity of jesus ? does current science support the existence of a creator god ? does it make sense to have faith in god ? " and then travels north america , interviewing acknowledged , academic experts on the question at hand . some rather shrill and not entirely rational attacks on the web protest : " but , strobel 's books are n't fair , because he only presents one side ! " perhaps these individuals missed the titles of these books , titles that appear quite prominently on the covers of the books . the first three words of each title is , " the case for.. . " no , strobel is not presenting the case *against* his topic ; he does n't represent himself as doing so . our christophobic media and academia presents that case relentlessly ; why should strobel waste paper and time doing that , when that is obviously not what he purports to be doing ? strobel 's accounts of his interviews of the experts are always reader-friendly , but he never talks down to his reader . if you do n't want to wade through the all too often alienating prose of too much academic writing , but want to get to the nub of the issue , strobel is your man . these techniques worked excellently in " the case for a creator " and " the case for christ , " but less well in " the case for faith . " there are three remarkably strong episodes in the book ; these episodes highlight what the rest of the book lacks . in the introduction , strobel interviews canadian evangelist turned atheist charles templeton . templeton presents a righteous , enraged case *against* god , and then , tearfully , admits how much he continues to adore jesus , and , indeed , to miss him . this wrenching passage masterfully captures the dilemma of many who have a love-hate relationship with their creator . in a few brief pages that serve as coda to chapter one , which addresses the question of suffering , strobel 's friend marc harrienger talks about his own pain when his wife ran over their child with the family car . this very brief account is testimony to the power of faith , even in the face of profound suffering . in another brief passage , strobel tells of his friend ron bronski , who went from being a vicious criminal to being a christian minister . these highly personal passages are what i will remember best from this book ; they were the most rewarding to read . the formal interviews with the experts did n't do a lot for me , and some were alienating . norman geisler 's treatment of the slaughter of the amalakites alienated me with its coldness and divorce from human concerns . it may be true that in war , children are killed with their adults - - when the us bombed german and japanese cities during ww ii we killed children as well as adults - - but any attempt to address such killings would have to be delivered with more compassion than geisler manages to convey . too , there is doubt , if not complete disbelief , among archaeologists as to whether these wars of conquest ever took place ( see israel finkelstein . ) the chapter entitled " church history is littered with oppression and violence " was especially weak , compared to other treatments of the same material . strobel 's treatment of the witch trials could have been improved with insights from lyndal roper 's work . strobel does n't handle understandings of nazism as a christian phenomenon well at all . the insistence that nazism was a christian phenomenon is revisionist and divorced from historical fact , and that should be made immediately clear as day in any discussion of the matter . nazism was a pagan and a scientific phenomenon . the pagan swastika was to replace the christian cross . scientific approaches to what constitutes life worthy of life was to replace " weak " christian ideas about humanity 's unity as god 's children and the value of all life . this is not made clear enough in strobel 's account . all in all , i have to say i 've encountered better treatments of the question of faith in other books ... and yet , strobel is such a good writer , and his technique is so engaging , that you could do worse than to read this book . read the other two books in the series first , though .
books neg 754.txt this book ( i believe ) is one of lem 's earlier stories and it reads like so-so pulp sci-fi . fiasco ( a true 5 star science fiction novel ) picks up the idea of contacting a new world and does it so much better . i suggest reading this only if you are a lem completist ( i 've read all of his stuff except 2 books )

health neg 512.txt this review covers the fb11nr : same unit with slightly different control pushbuttons and with an ir remote . somehow , i had deluded myself into thinking that the spinning massagers under each foot were powered . nope.. . basically just built-in plastic versions of those usually wooden massaging rollers that one rolls one 's foot upon . that 's fine , yet when i want to relax , i 'm not thinking about moving my feet . fortunately , those are removable , and removal is exactly what happened . the killer was that the center massage wheel , which is supposed to be powered and is supposed to spin , was d.o.a. this unit went back to the store , and we bought an fb21 instead . amazon has no listing for that model , so i ca n't give a full review on it . it was good enough to keep . both the fb11nr and the fb21 share some traits . neither one really keeps water anywhere near its original temperature . sound levels vary from fairly quiet to quite loud , depending upon the operating mode chosen ( i did db measurements on the fb21 , but since amazon does n't list that one , you do n't get to see them ) . the fb21 seems to have slightly better build quality , and everything worked out of the box , so we kept that one

software pos 992.txt compared to fp 2000 and earlier versions , it offered some major improvements , even letting one code in ( gasp ) php with live preview - it is highly configurable , and easily tied into sharepoint ( well , i think that was the intent ) . it was quite an evolution , moving beyond fp2000 , with some fairly advanced features - while still retaining the " entry level , small business learnable " functionality ( albeit cookie cutter designs ) of previous versions . i was surprised to find it even offered options to strip out all code that hinted this site was made with frontpage ( an odd change , knowing ms ) , but also offered other code functions , some on par with dreamweaver - but do not mistake this for dreamweaver , even the first mx version . it 's still aimed at microsoft only - you really have to dig and tweak to configure it for anything else ( e.g , php , cold fusion ) - but it does offer some major improvements for flexibility over previous versions . mostly good , some horribly bad . the good - being able to tweak it to dozens of standards ' compliance , sec . 508 , xml'ish stuff , whatever . by default these things are not set up , so it does take some learning . what annoyed ( and freaked me out ) was that while it easily allowed for desktop development with access , to create database driven sites - the database had to remain in a public folder - ok , i suppose if you 're using it only on an intranet . i believe the point was to code with access , then mod it slightly to interact with sql server - but most folks probaby did not use it that way - knowing the history and " fire and forget " ease of use of frontpage.. . anyhow , i 'd call this a para-professional version . it has way more flexibility and functionality than any version of frontpage , ever . it is also going bye-bye . there will not be a frontpage 2007 , due to the switch to expression web ( which retains some fp functionality , but the " friendly " and pesky " bots " are gone ) . no more email bots , whatever bots - gotta learn how to roll your own .

music neg 367.txt or in their entire career for that matter . i have tried to like this band , but greg dulli just wo n't shut up . every song is his snide lyrical diatribing , on and on and on . the guitarist keeps things mildly interesting , but on this album in particular , the drummer also wo n't shut up and play a straight beat for once . it 's like three guys in their own worlds , and they mash it together and call what they 've done songs . except for the one decent song they did , the only rock song i can think of that is hard , psychedelic , passionate , powerful , and set to a waltz beat of all things . " let me lie to you " is the best song they ever made , because everyone in the band is given room to breathe by the song 's framework and tempo . instead of piling in on top of each other till the end of the song like they usually seem to do , everyone agrees to hold back until the rushing choruses , and it 's less muddled and better orchestrated for it . it 's a shame they did n't do any other songs like this , at least none that i have heard . i tried to like them , i really did . i wanted to find the band that made that one song , and discover a whole treasure chest of dark , passionate , noisy music like that . too bad , no wonder they drifted apart

music neg 23.txt many albums , including this one , have the problem that all the songs pretty much sound the same ; but this also has the troublesome problem of music that is too easy on the ears and that never gets very exciting - except for the first two tracks . the use of many poetry elements in their lyrics ca n't save the blandness of the music . " what about everything " and " life less ordinary " are good songs . the rest pretty much sound the same and will put you to sleep .

books neg 91.txt the author is a journalist , but he seems straight out of the chamber of commerce or a right-wing think tank . like business elites , the author basically does not particularly like democracy . in his view societies should be run by elites from several areas - even authoritarians if needed . he is a proponent of constitutional liberalism , based on laws , rights , especially property rights , separation of powers , with much of that power being held in unelected bodies , and most of all free-market capitalism . he finds that set of conditions to be far more important than the exercise of democracy . his low regard for democracy is easily seen in his minimal interest in the manner in which a society of laws is created or even its exact nature and who benefits . most in the west do care . rights and legal systems are not neutral : the manner of construction determines relative winners and empowerment . though the author 's real target is us society , he looks at the results of democracy over the world . and of course , he finds plenty of examples where democracy does n't work . a country in the grip of fanatics will invariably elect and support leaders who are little concerned with rights and legalisms . but it is ridiculous to imply that those situations have any bearing on democracy in the us . in the us , the author is most concerned with what he calls the democratization of society over the last fifty or so years . in actuality , he is focusing on mass culture that is spread through mass consumption as vigorously promulgated by globalizing capitalism . in this era , elites in finance , business , law , banking , health care , various media , etc have likewise been swept up , in fact are the driving force , in a money-first culture . he contends that such elites once had an ethos of service and basically kept our democracy on track via subtle pressures on the masses . it is simply a cynical misrepresentation to hold that massive shopping at wal-mart and the like represents democratic empowerment . the actual test of democracy would be the ability of a community to stop the wal-mart juggernaut . he especially decries direct citizen actions . he is correct to observe that referenda and initiatives have had unintended consequences , often being usurped by special interests with deep pockets . however , he little notes that citizens have taken those routes due to the unresponsiveness of legislative processes . it 's hard to take seriously the stance that the robber barons of the late 19th century , and their heirs , should be viewed as elites who kept our democracy on course , after bribing entire state legislatures as well as members of congress to accumulate vast sums . if citizens had actually been democratically empowered , such distortions of the political process could have been prevented . the theme that cash sanitizes crooks is as american as apple pie . his view that such unelected bodies as the supreme court and the federal reserve board prevent illiberal democracy is also questionable . who could be unaware of the politicization of those bodies : the embarrassing handling of the presidential election of 2000 or the cheerleading role of the fed during the stock market bubble of the late 1990s benefiting financial elites ? no , rule by elites has very frequency distorted and usurped democracy , not buttressed it . if the author put journalism first , instead of being an apologist for 21st century capitalism , he would note the death grip that corporations now have over our society and the political process , actually foiling democracy . first and foremost that control is solidified through the mass media and the education system , distorting and muting all challenging ideas . it is not surprising that americans have been unable to mount any significant challenge to this latest version of laissez-faire , free-market capitalism that is involved in such harmful developments as free-trade agreements , worker visa programs , massive immigration , out-of-control energy policies , broken health care systems , huge cutbacks in various safety net programs , massive redistribution of wealth upwards , the gutting of our manufacturing base , etc. the list could go on . informed , empowered citizens would not permit this system of corporate rule to exist . the us most decidedly is not in a state of too much democracy , but is in the throes of democratic failure , which election hoopla very conveniently disguises periodically . this is the story of democracy that the author chooses to ignore . it is surprising to see the fairly high ratings of this book . americans are supposedly fiercely democratic . yet here is a book that clearly advocates elite rule , even anti-democratic generals if need be . the book is really worth reading only to see the willingness of some to contain citizen empowerment .

dvd neg 916.txt the slick stylish spanish thriller " nobody knows anybody " is set in seville during holy week in the year 2000. newspaper crossword puzzle developer and would-be writer simon cardenas ( eduardo noriega ) is struggling as usual with his novel when he receives a cryptic telephone message ordering him to use the word " adversary " as an answer to an upcoming crossword clue . since the message also contained threats , simon does what he 's told , and he soon finds himself embroiled in a nightmarish sequence of events . directed by mateo gil , " nobody knows anything " opens with a scene of a man stabbed to death with a crucifix through his heart , and this scene is one of the ideas that feeds the notion you are about to see some sort of horror film with religious overtones , but the plot moves away from the horror aspect into straight thriller territory . the film- -which owes much of its style to american thrillers- -is slickly produced , and the exotic settings of the sights and sounds of seville help , but the preposterous plot with its huge gaps in logic and implausibility ultimately left this viewer disappointed and feeling a bit cheated by the experience . i was intrigued at first by the film and drawn into the plot . however , once the plot and the mystery aspect became clear ( and i ca n't give away too much here ) , the film became silly and trite . there 's little character development- -our hero is a flat , dull passive character , and the film 's emphasis is on the thrill aspect . a slick product that is ultimately empty and really ridiculous , this film is in spanish with english subtitles- -displacedhuma

health pos 296.txt i 'm more than satisfied with this scale . i was concerned that i would have to buy a more expensive scale to get good accuracy ( see reviews of other digital scales in this price range , ) but i 've tested it several times over several days , and my weight varies by 2 pounds or less over the course of the day . my first weigh-in of the day is pretty much the same as previous mornings , sadly . the neutral color ( grey ) and glass would blend in well with just about any decor , and the lcd screen is easy to read , with 1.5 inch high numbers . the only thing i do n't like about it is that it creaks quite a lot when i step on it , even though i 'm nowhere near its 330 pound maximum load . that problem is in my head more than in the scale : i do n't think it 's going to break , but it sounds like i 've got two people standing on it at once- -i 'm not that fat , am i ? an added feature is that when i 'm craving , i go into the bathroom and look at it , and know that it is n't going to fall for any of my excuses tomorrow morning . so the last piece of cake still sits in the fridge . the scale has intimidated me into not eating it . accurate , easy to read , easy on the eyes , and intimidating- -i think it 's a good deal
dvd pos 451.txt i do n't often watch foreign films . the reason being , as an american , i do n't feel that i can ever fully grasp the cultural and linguistic subtleties needed to truly understand and enjoy these works . french... . spanish... . german.. . etc... . regardless of nationality , genre , or time period , they generally leave me cold . with that in mind , i went into this with no doubts as to the film 's greatness , but again , did n't think as an american i would be able to see it , as the situational nuances would be lost on me . as it turned out , i was wrong , and found a sublime masterpiece that went down easily , and did n't seem obtuse or " foreign " . the experience could best be likened to watching " the graduate " , as you find yourself viewing seemingly mundane events and conversations , but the subtle turns in those events and words speak of such depth and gravity that you feel almost driven to your knees by the masterwork that you are watching . i wo n't recap the storyline , or discuss details of the movie itself , i just wanted to say that i went into this skeptical , expecting to find a picture that i could n't relate to , but what i found was an immediate , compelling and moving work that speaks volumes of the human condition .

books neg 739.txt we went to a book siging to get this book . truthfully , i was n't sure if the book was going to live up to the hype . t.o. graciously signed books and all proceeds went to charity . i was surprised this book was so well written . my four year old wants me to read it over and over again . he does n't like for me to read to him but he loves this book ! it is the perfect book for children . its not too short but not too long . i have read this book at least 10 times in the past 3 days . i would recommend this book to anyone with small children . it is great book for little boys because of the football theme . however , the lesson is something everyone can appreciate . great book
music pos 525.txt as a kid , out of the blue was one of the first albums ( actually , 8-track ) i paid for . that decision was made after hearing " sweet talking woman " as a single , and after i bought it , the album grew and grew with me . every few weeks , a different set of songs stuck with me as memorable . the first few weeks , it was " sweet talking woman , " " turn to stone , " and " mr. blue sky " ( all pop perfection ) ; the next few weeks , it was " wild west hero , " " across the border , " and " jungle . " after three months , there was n't a corner or edge of the album i did n't know and like . thirty years later , the remastered cd finally comes around and , through the fan club at [...] ( which i heartily recommend because of their labors of love ) i bought this and balance of power ( review coming ) . i have to say i was a little scared to put this on again after all this time as my tastes of music have evolved and the label of " pretentious " has been placed on them by my 16 year old son ( a prog rocker , nonetheless ) . a big sigh of relief- -the cd holds the same joys it did before . the moog synthesizer riff by jeff lynne in " turn to stone " still pumps the heart , while " sweet talking woman " and songs like " wild west hero " and " jungle " still delight . but i 'm amazed at how things like the " concerto for a rainy day " ( four songs including " mr. blue sky " - -still the brightest jewel on this album ) still hold together , and songs like " stepping out " and " sweet is the night " step up to dig their hooks into you even today . while the remastering is very good and makes some tunes step up ( " across the border " ' s horns beg you to crank them up ) , there are a few drop outs ( " night in the city " has a couple ) , and of course , my tastes probably do n't translate to everyone . but , my 16 years old has given the album a careful listen , and he has n't returned it to me yet- -i imagine for the next few weeks i 'll still enjoy listening to " out of the blue " from downstairs for a few more weeks. .

books neg 156.txt i found stale recounting of very well-known facts about 20th century technologies and their economics , with no insights . since it covers the gamut from plastics to jet engines to microprocessors , and it 's only 200 pages in a fairly large typeface , i was n't expecting historical depth . but i was expecting at least one fresh idea . i bought it on the strength of a much earlier book by nathan rosenberg ( about technology in the economy of the 19th century ) . i was disappointed . i get the feeling the book is intended as a brief survey for people who just came down in the last shower - - college freshmen born in the 1980s . i 'll bet they find it kinda stodgy

software neg 762.txt at first i thought the idea of offering a set of the most popular applications at an affordable price was great . recently , however , many computer makers have started using ms works as the standard pre-loaded suite on new machines . users who need more than very very basic features will need to buy more dependable software packages ( e.g. ms office ) . the word processor in works , for instance , does not have many macrons that are commonly used in dutch , scandinavian , turkish , romanized russian , japanese etc. . in the end the low price of ms works is a way to save money to computer makers and to squeeze out extra money from buyers who will need to upgrade to better products anyway

books neg 237.txt this book was a huge disappointment . sue grafton and kinsey meander all over california but come up with nothing of substance . the author spent more time describing the decor of a hospital room than explaining the murder motive . the characters and their actions are bogus and contrived . for example , kinsey becomes emotionally attached to a young prostitute she met two days before . it does n't work because it is n't real . it is sue grafton bending her characters into grotesque positions as she tries to force a plot into this dull mess . the story makes little sense as we try to follow the seemingly interminable clues and innumerable side characters . when it was all over , i still did n't know why the murders had been committed . save your eyesight ! do not bother picking up this book

( do n't bother to right-click anything , in their imperial wisdom right-clicking is now pretty useless . ) but if you do put the shortcuts back up they are now all black and white and it is really difficult to find the one you want . in place of the shortcuts they added some icons that i have yet to figure out or to need . what are they thinking ? ? ? ? a lot of the presets have been reconfigured and trying to figure them out gave me a headache . after several hours of playing with this pile of garbage i decided to uninstall it and return to using 1.5.

music pos 657.txt in many ways , this album is everything one would have expected- - somehow the natural successor to " no pussyfooting " and " evening star " . in other ways , its nothing like i would have expected- - the usual stamps of fripp and eno 's recent work seems to be missing . its really quite hard to largely identify the identity of the musician generating the sound on much of this material , there 's obvious stuff ( we 'll come to that in a minute ) , but as a rule , the backgrounds could be either of them . sonically , it moves through a number of backdrops , with delicate , percussive , synthish loops dominating the early part of the record ( " meissa " , " lyra " , " tarazed " ) , wheras the middle of the record feels more like their old collaborations updated , the sort of modern fripp soundscapes being more apparent ( " lupus " , " ankaa " ) . the remainder of the album features on track that is totally unexpected , the downright funky " altair " , with its train shuffling rhythms , drum loops , and funky guitar ( in ways similar to material from the eno / schwaum " drawn from life " record ) , and the closer , " terebellum " , is an aggressive , haunting , and almost angry sounding piece almost reminiscent of " radiophonics " or the other more aggressive soundscapes . over this material , fripp largely solos using a variant of his legendary fuzz tone- - its a bit mellower , and rounder though , similar to his leads on " starless " and " the power to believe part ii " but in a more hushed feel . so that tells not much , the real question is , what 's it like ? largely an ambient affair , the collaboration is what you 'd expect- - there 's no real incindiery moments here- - do n't look for a " baby 's on fire " , but it is comparable to their previous collaborations in quality , and it certainly sounds nothing like crimson . some of it is full of delicate beauty ( " lyra " ) , some of its just a blast ( " altair " ) , some of its actually quite hard to listen to at all ( " terebellum " ) . for fans of ambient music , especially the work of these two gentelemen , this one will be quite rewarding . it falls short somehow of being a masterpiece , but it is really a great record . recommended

music neg 524.txt hammerfall is one of the bigger names out there in the power metal world , and this cd sounds pretty much like the previous 5 albums . the only dofference is that they have gotten worse . i write this review to the two groups of people out there : the exisiting hammerfall fans , and those trying them out for the first time . for already existing hammerfall fans such as myslef , i strongly urge that you do not buy this cd , unless it goes below 3-4 dollars on amazon . for those looking to try hammerfall out and get into the power metal genre for the first time , go ahead and get this one , because hammerfall are by no means bad musicians . they can all play very well , but this cd lacks refinement and creativity . start here and work your way up to the better hammerfall , which you will no doubt appreciate more . hammerfall keeps putting out the same album over and over and over , if you know what i mean . all of their songs sound relatively similar , but this cd marks one of the lowerest points in their career

books neg 912.txt never in my life have i been so outraged by what i have read as by the drivel spouted by dr. west in this book ( in his translator 's note ) , and by the use of ` unponderingly ' and " the thinkery " ( among other things ) in his translation of the clouds . i also read his translation of plato 's apology of socrates , and found it grossly inferior to jowett . four texts on socrates is not a book to be tossed aside lightly : it should be hurled with great force . ( apologies to dorothy parker . ) not only are the translations themselves inexcusably inept , almost everything that he writes in his translator 's note is wrong . the clouds is a play , not a scientific or mathematical treatise . as such , it has characters and dialogue . a ` modern ' translation of a play must be something that could be presented on a stage and make sense to a ` modern ' audience . if a character is supposed to be bizarre or out of the ordinary , one does not make him spout drivel such as ' unponderingly ' ; one gives him a ` shtick ' , which is a theatrical term . it 's more or less a running gag associated with a particular character . you create , through clever ways of speaking or odd ways of stringing his words together , a characterization . he could be made to speak like a parody of william f . buckley or the star wars character yoda . as it stands , west 's text cannot be presented as a play . it is neither necessary nor useful to coin such nonsense as ' unponderingly ' ; indeed , it is inexcusable . it conveys neither humor nor cleverness . it comes off simply as stupid . the translator of a play must know something about theatre and drawing characters , which dr. west obviously does not . to state it bluntly : the translation of plays should be left to people who understand theatre and characterization , and who are creative . dr. west does n't have a creative bone in his body . in regard to his translation of plato 's the apology of socrates , the translation by dr. west is both original and good , but the parts that are good are not original , and the parts that are original are not good . after all , when one has the work of such a brilliant predecessor as benjamin jowett to follow , the temptation to do something entirely different is strong . but it must be resisted . if dr. west had merely lightly revised jowett 's great work , he would have made a contribution to learning . alas , he did neither . the version by jowett is clearly superior . here is a short excerpt : " and i must beg of you to grant me a favor : if i defend myself in my accustomed manner , and you hear me using the words which i have been in the habit of using in the agora , at the tables of the money-changers , or anywhere else , i would ask you not to be surprised , and not to interrupt me on this account . for i am more than seventy years of age , and appearing now for the first time in a court of law , i am quite a stranger to the language of the place ; and therefore i would have you regard me as if i were really a stranger , whom you would accuse if he spoke in his native tongue , and after the fashion of his country : am i making an unfair request of you ? never mind the manner , which may or may not be good ; but think only of the truth of my words , and give heed to that : let the speaker speak truly and the judge decide justly . " compare west 's inept version : " ...i do very much beg and beseech this of you : if you hear me speaking in my defense with the same speeches i am accustomed to speak both in the marketplace at the money-tables , where many of you have heard me , and elsewhere , do not wonder or make a disturbance because of this . for this is how it is : now is the first time i have come before a law court , at the age of seventy ; hence i am simply foreign to the manner of speech here . so just as , if i really did happen to be a foreigner , you would surely sympathize with me if i spoke in the dialect and way in which i was raised , so also i do beg of you now ( and it is just , at least , as it seems to me ) : leave aside the manner of my speech- -for perhaps it may be worse , but perhaps better- -and instead consider this very thing and apply your mind to this : whether the things i say are just or not . for this is the virtue of a judge , while that of an orator is to speak the truth . " " speaking...with the same speeches i am accustomed to speak " ? how utterly inept and repetitive ! did n't he even proof-read ? one does n't speak with ' speeches ' , one speaks with words ! it is obvious that dr. west never read his version aloud as a test of its appropriateness , which is surprising , because this work is supposed to be a speech . dr. west 's version is clearly not suited to speaking aloud , whereas jowett 's is . in west 's translation , socrates is a clumsy , repetitive , and inept speaker . needlessly so . if you want to read a good translation , see jowett 's 3rd edition ( 1892 ) . why does dr. west believe himself qualified to make translations ? nothing in his work suggests that he is competent in any way to do so . this is not the work of a scholar , but that of a bungling hack . these translations are travesties . how does work this nauseatingly bad get published ? not recommende

music neg 370.txt reviewgium - volume i , issue xvii over sixty and still going strong , neil young has released a new album , largely politcal and essentially a focused attack on u.s. president george w . bush . as opposed to his last album which was a more bittersweet , country-tinged effort , living with war is a pretty much straightforward rock album , mostly electric with a background choir featured on many tracks , as well as an unusually predominant trumpet player on several tracks . musically , it 's nothing spectacular , in fact every song more or less follows the same tired formula , and there are really no diversions from the grunge-like rhythm guitar chords . but the album is obviously intended to have a major focus on the vocals and lyrics . of course , many people do not like neil young 's vocals , but there are many well-developed choral passages throughout the album , including a soulful , a capella arrangement of " america the beautiful , " which closes the album . so basically , i feel the vocal performances compensate- -though not totally- -for the lack of musical diversity . lyrically , the album is pretty blatant ; it could almost be a 60 's protest album . but underlying that , is a ray of hope and an urge to change our country for the better . there are a few decent tracks on the album , even if they are not exactly mind-blowing ( not that neil young was ever a showboater ) . " after the garden " is actually quite a good song as is " shock and awe . " " flags of freedom " is a bit of an upper , so i can probably call that the album highlight , though i 'm sure the more politically-minded citizen will enjoy " let 's impeach the president , " an almost humorous overview of bush 's faltering standpoints . the final three songs divert from the general theme of dismay and protest , and offer feelings of hope and introspection . if you are not a fan of neil young , you 'll find nothing here that will convert you , so you may just want to leave this on the shelf . if you are " anti-bush " you might get a buzz off of the lyrical aspect , but that 's probably the only thrill you will get . i tend to avoid anything political , so music aside , this album 's message does not really appeal to me . it 's like , yeah , people hate the president , blah blah blah , we know...give it a rest . for fans of neil , i would n't exactly say " you 're not missing anything " by avoiding this album ; there is some good stuff on there , but you might want to wait until you see it cheap in the " used " bin at your local cd shop . and for those interested , this is not a crazy horse album .

music neg 247.txt the music on this album is performed so exquisitely ; the orchestrations so subtle and yet illuminating , that one is almost tempted to forget what a " what for ? " musical this is . donna murphy plays the title character of fosca , a hugely unprepossessing woman who suffers from more maladies than there are stars in the sky . she lives in a remote miltary outpost where she falls in love with the handsome , virile giorgio . giorgio in turn is having a torrid affair with the beautiful , but vapid clara , a married woman back home . however from the time giorgio comes into fosca 's sphere , she becomes this relentless succubus in her pursuit of him . she shows up everywhere he happens to be ; her ferocity matched only by her inexhaustive capacity for self-pity . to depict fosca musically , sondheim comes up with the most monochromatic score of his career . everything is so lugubrious , dark , portentous , tragic ; punctuated by militaristic strains ( with snare drums ) because the soldiers like to...umm...march . in the end , giorgio is worn down enough by fosca 's attentions that he succumbs . he believes he has fallen in love with her , shortly after which she...dies . as i mentioned earlier , the material is beautifully performed ( marin mazzie and jere shea render the opening " happiness " with a marvelous sense of delicacy and sensuality . donna murphy evokes the proper pathos in the haunting " loving you . " ) , but you come away wondering what the point of it all is . if sondheim is trying to show us how love is largely a chronic disease , then he succeeds admirably
music pos 384.txt i 've always written how the american now compilations do not even come close to the british ones , and my opinion has not since changed . now 20 's track list , however , is solid and pretty good for the american series . it has mostly good rap songs ( which can be sometimes rare in this series ) , great rock songs , and not an overload of mediocrities . i 'll go in depth . 1. missy elliott feat . ciara & fatman scoop - lose control...a a great rap song - missy elliott has a great style and her lyrics are actually understandable and enjoyable . ciara is a nice addition to the song . fatman scoop 's random screaming in the background was n't essential , but it at least adds some energy to the track . the music 's actually interesting and something different from everything else . 2. black eyed peas - do n't phunk with my heart...c+ their first album was stellar , and their second is as well . but this was one of the worst tracks on " monkey business " and did not deserve to become a single . annoying , but not horrible . 3. pussycat dolls feat . busta rhymes - do n't cha...a - a really good rap song - busta 's rapping is a good addition to the song , making this radio remix better than the original on the pussycat dolls ' album , " pcd " . a dangerously catchy chorus elevates this song to a pretty high grade . 4. rihanna - pon de replay...b+ pretty catchy , and a good party song . but it gets pretty irritating after a while . and the " dip it low and you pick it up slow " from the first verse directly copies from christina milian 's " dip it low " . that 's so unoriginal , rihanna ! 5. ludacris feat . bobby valentino - pimpin ' all over the world...b good music , but it 's not much without the video , which was , by the way , partly shot in africa . 6. bow wow feat . ciara - like you...b bow wow 's returning to the rap scene was really unneeded , but ciara 's chorus makes this song better than mediocre . 7. dem franchize boys feat . jermaine dupri , da brat & bow wow - i think they like me ( remix ) ...c this song does not deserve the publicity , and i 'm stunned why people like this . it 's worse than mediocre , it 's horribly irritating . and much of the song is bleeped out because the original is so dirty . rap just is n't rap when it 's edited , and this song is proof . but even without the editing i do n't think this song has a chance . annoying " yep " s in the background and mediocre rapping...just skip it already . 8. destiny 's child - cater 2u...b - mediocre for destiny 's child . actually pretty boring . but they have great voices . 9. lyfe jennings - must be nice...c+ mediocre . 10. natasha bedingfield - these words...a a great " new " artist who actually found success with this song a year earlier the us . great songwriting about bad songwriting ( if that makes any sense at all ) and a good voice . now i 'm just wondering when her brother daniel 's going to release another " if you 're not the one " . 11. kelly clarkson - behind these hazel eyes...a - the only american idol who earned over twenty minutes of success , kelly 's finding massive success with her second album , and for a reason - she 's got an awesome voice , and pulls off rock quite well . this song was brutally murdered by the radio , but that 's why i 've moved onto the remixes ( not on this album ) . 12. d.h.t. - listen to your heart ( unplugged version ) ...a though furios f.ez 's hard trance remix of this song is a lot better than this unplugged piano version , this amazing cover of the roxette track deserved all the fame it got . edmee 's got a fantastic voice and this is a perfect song for her . beautiful song also . 13. backstreet boys - just want you to know...a - the backstreet boys ' newest album must have been the #1 most unwanted comeback of all time ( let 's just hope n*sync does n't follow...*cringe* justin timberlake ) , but this is their best song . and this comes from someone hard to impress by the backstreet boys , but they pull off this rock song pretty well . 14. click 5 - just the girl...a a really good rock song which many can relate to . 15. franz ferdinand - do you want to...b atonal , but franz ferdinand has a good reputation , so i 'll let it slide . but this is definitely evidence of a sophomore slump . 16. weezer - beverly hills...a+ unfortunately it was flattened , torn apart , and buried alive by the radios , so i will review it as it was still last summer when i first heard it . this song is amazing and the chorus is way too catchy to believe . but i do n't need to write this , as most people already know . 17. fall out boy - sugar we 're going down...a an amazing song , but it 's only good if you can put up with songs where you ca n't understand what they 're saying . seriously , it took approximately six times looking up the lyrics to actually realize what 's being said here . but the music is great , and this song overall is a pretty good rock track . 18. lifehouse - you & me...a - an instant classic . 19. coldplay - fix you...a+ i 've read mixed reviews about this song , but personally , i think its amazing . following a vaguely similar buildup as led zeppelin 's " stairway to heaven " , this song just keeps you listening until the end . the rockout part at the end is magical . 20. keith urban - you 'll think of me...b it 's somewhat annoying that keith 's been on now albums consistently for a while but his songs are n't as popular as , say , gretchen wilson . i 'm starting to think keith 's been put on these albums not for popular songs but just so a default country artist could be there . a good song , but it could 've been replaced with something better in the country department . so overall , this is a great selection of songs , some amazing , some decent , and some mediocre to bad . i 'd suggest you buy this , as it 's a good list of tracks . overall , this album gets a b+.

music neg 512.txt i feel that a lot of bands were good in the 90's . this band was one of them . while yes , they were a bit poppy and sellout-ish on americana and conspiracy , they still had enough bad@ss in them to put on a rad song . i think they should have just did a " da hui " single with " the noose " and maybe " cant get my head around you " on it . this sucks really bad . it makes the average conspiracy of one look like a bad religion album ! ! if you must hear , download or borrow . please guys . quit or make good music . its pretty pathetic hearing " hit that " next to the godawful creed and nickelbland ! ! so we go from a punk-ish hard rock band that is inspired by tsol and the damned and plays punk shows with pennywise to this...a corporate radio rock album that is loved by teenybopper frat boys and the mtv mindless
camera pos 258.txt i read many reviews at fredmiranda.com before i purchased this lens and i was not dissapointed one bit . i was lucky enough to receive a very sharp copy of this lens on the first try . the macro shots were very sharp and contrasty . the center part is already reaching near maximum sharpness at f2.8 anything beyond f4 is tack sharp . be carefull with this lens though . the dof at f2.8 is extremely narrow . do n't mistaken the out of focus shots for being unsharp . focus properly and crank up the aperture and you 'll get some very satisfying macro shots . the only thing i wish this lens had was image stabilizer . canon , how about a 100mm macro with is ?

camera pos 429.txt this camera does everything it says ; yes , it 's waterproof and i was very uneasy taking a digital camera into the water for the first time ! ! only reason i did n't give it 5 stars : it is as slow as every other digital camera i 've owned as far as focusing , multiple flashes , and then actually shooting . you get your subject 's attention and they smile , frozen , as you hold down the shutter release for a good 3 seconds until the shot is taken ( in low light . ) i was especially intrigued by its " bright capture " technology , but it honestly does n't seem any different in low light than my old sony u20 2mp tiny little snapshot camera . still that same flash-in-the-dark look . there is a fill-flash low light program mode ( among many many others ) , but the shutter speed sets itself so slow the background becomes a messy worthless blob , even if you hold your breath and try to remain still . my ideal snapshot camera is portable , durable , quick , easy , and produces excellent results without having to think about your exposure modes . this camera has 3.5 out of those 5. it is way portable , very durable , easy , produces ok results but you have to mess with settings if you 're not in daylight , and it 's not very quick . overall i am very happy with the purchase and will carry it everywhere

dvd pos 146.txt intimacy is n't about titillation or tanned toned hollywood studs and babes having perfectly choreographed sex in beautiful lighting while poor piano music plays . instead it 's about an ordinary pair of people seeking solace in a purely physical relationship . both are empty individuals and briefly find something to fire them in their weekly sexual meetings . nothing is said but there is a purity of understanding . the relationship , and the film , only falters when the film moves outside the seedy flat that the liaisons take place in . the wordless arrangement can only work while everything is strictly anonymous , and once jay ( rylance ) delves into claire 's ( fox ) personal life their apparently simple relationship becomes more complicated . it 's also here that the film briefly slumps . jay encounters claire 's taxi driver husband , played by an uncharacteristically off form timothy spall . speaking nonsense and totally over the top , his scenes are almost unbearably dreary . i can certainly see why claire would want peace and quiet and intense sex after listening to that intensely boring man twitter on . still , it does n't make his scenes any better to watch . despite that though the film regains it footing and ends strongly . even timothy spall 's character shows some hidden depths ! however , intimacy works best as a comment on the relationships people trap themselves in . it 's easier to stay in an unhappy relationship than walk out , and starting something new takes courage . jay and claire are unable to escape their empty lives , except in their sexual relationship . really both are cowards . neither is happy , but neither makes a serious effort to change their circumstances . sex is a temporary answer to a permanent problem , and until they reach out for something more neither will be happy . the film had an increasing energy which i liked , and i 'm sure you would like it too , if you let yourself inside the film .

dvd neg 753.txt let me accept the fact that lotr is my most beloved film and i already own the extended editions of the films in one set ! i 'm really not surprised to see new line coming up with another edition of the trilogy . with films like these they will squeeze the collectors as much as they can ! ! still , inspite of this new set containing both the theatrical versions and the extended cuts of the films and also the much hyped costa botes documentaries , my advise to anyone buying lotr for the first time is - do not buy this set ! spend a little more and you get all the movies in full 6.1 dts ex glory , alongwith hours of endless in-depth bonus features which probably you 'll spend rest of your life watching ! ! please be aware , these new editions do not contain dts tracks , no commentary tracks by the director , weta workshop or the cast . all you get is both versions crammed into one single disc and just one documentary as a bonus on the second disc...and nothing else . it would have been a better idea had new line released the documentaries separately without forcing the consumer to buy the films again....and even this is not the end , once the hd format gains a little more acceptance , they 'll have another excuse to come up with a new version of the trilogy ! beware , extended edition set is the ultimate lotr experience , in terms of films or bonus features . go get it...its worth all the money spent !

" a princess of mars " , " the gods of mars " , and " the warlord of mars " are erb 's greatest work . it is sad , in a way , that tarzan obscures erbs mars novels for the general public . these books deserve to be beter known , and it is astonishing no movie or tv adaptation has ever been attempted ( which might be a good thing , after all ! ) . if only steven spielberg or peter jackson were interested ! of course , genre and erb aficionados have long know and cherised these great stories . i wonder how many others were first attracted to these by the magnificent ballantine editions of the 1960s ? if you are a fan as am i , support leonaur ltd.

books neg 411.txt as a lecturer of e-commerce , i was looking forward to reading this book on the social implications of the internet . however , i am most disappointed with the boring and superficial way the subject is explored . the author takes a couple of anecdotical examples to show the concequences in the shift of power that the internet has brought about . the result is a disjointed treatment of an otherwise most interesting topic . i have nothing good to say about this book - money wasted
dvd neg 695.txt the animation ... excellent . the characters ... excellent . the premise ... excellent . laugh lines ... plenty of them and well executed . this is a movie you will say was worth spending your money on . the problem is ... as adults you will understand the movie is about putting the past to rest so you are free to enjoy your now and your future . for kids , they do n't see a lesson in putting your past to rest , they see - if you do n't like something - put it to rest ... as is r.i.p. - dead ! after the crotchety old man ( does n't every haunted house need one to heighten the tension ) identifies the haunting is related to someone he knows ... there is far too personal a vendetta to finish them off ( again ) . also shame on the producers of this movie.. . a kids movie ... there is far too much irresponsible adult behaviour ( babysitter getting it on with boyfriend , boyfriend getting drunk and threatening the kids , etc ) - - it is just not necessary to tell this story . i would n't let any relative of mine , under 14 , see this otherwise excellent flick
camera pos 656.txt i stumbled across this little gem by accident . i was picking up supplies at office depot and they had a kodak z650 ( display model ) on sale for under $100. it was a ridiculous impulse buy- -i already own 4 digital cameras ... the last thing i needed was another camera ! but what a delighful suprise this camera turned out to be ! it 's come the closest to rivaling the image quality of my old olympus c-740. i had never seriously looked at kodak cameras ... i always steered clear of them based on bad press and negative comments about them from my friends who are " serious " photographers . but i could n't be happier with this little bargain ... it basically serves the need i wanted to fill - - a 6mp camera that takes the kind of quality shots i was used to with my c-740. there are a few negatives in that it can be a little slow in processing the shots , but there is very little shutter-lag when taking the shots . i 've gotten some amazing birds-in-flight shots with it- -something i 've never been able to accomplish with any of my other cameras , including the c-740. some low-contrast shots come out a bit noisy , but for the most part the shots are very crisp and sharp . it handles low-light settings better than any of the others in this class that i 've tried . at less than a third of the price of my canon s2-is , this little camera outclasses the others by a mile . i stumbled on to a good find in the z650 ... it 's not going to give you dlsr quality photos , but no point-and-shoot will . this camera is perfect for any one who likes to take great outdoor and wildlife shots . i just wish someone would have given a good report on kodak cameras before i spent a small fortune on the others
music pos 951.txt if you enjoyed explosions in the sky 's last album " the earth is not a cold dead place " , and the songs by the group on the " friday night lights soundtrack " , then surely , you shall find love for their newest record " all of a sudden i miss everyone " . if you are new to explosions in the sky , i can only personally describe their music to you as lush , captivating , graceful , energetic , and highly inspirational art rock instrumentations . please ignore reviewers who rate this album negatively because they do n't like it as much as their last album ( yet ) . " all of a sudden i miss everyone " is different than previous records ; it is alot darker , but at the same time hopeful and promising , best listened to on a rainy day or a cold dark night ( again , personal description ) . what more can i say.. . this is about as beautiful as three guitars and a drum set can sound . my favorite album of 2007 so far .

software neg 724.txt you will probably be more productive and less bug ridden if you stick with what you have . do n't expect to turn this version on and be able to use it . many changes are literally imposed on you , like the ribbons instead of the familiar icon bars . missing menus and the auto-double space setting every time you hit return . there are new features which can be helpful to some , but microsoft probably thinks you can afford a week for retraining . the arrogance of microsoft not even to offer the menus everyone is used to as a classic or traditional option is incredible . you upgrade for hundreds of dollars to get totally stuck and run out to buy a manual .

books neg 298.txt i had to take a look at this book just like i did rachel shteir 's previous book " striptease " to see if the online reviews were true . sadly , they were . like " striptease " , this book was full of typo 's and appeared poorly organized and written . one would think that ms. shteir would have learned from her previous book- -which also had similarly poor reviews . i wonder why gypsy rose lee paired up with her . i can only guess at ms. shteir 's fascination with this topic : my guess is that she wishes she could be a stripper herself ( or maybe she is ) . i base this in part on a meeting with ms. shteir a year ago when i invited her to write about a professional conference i organized and presented at : she wore a very low-cut blouse as she interviewed people . i 'm no prude but this was highly inappropriate and distracting people told me . on top of that , her article was chock full of misquotes , errors in fact , and adopted a perspective that nobody who attended the conference could relate to . oh well , i can only hope that ms. shteir 's next project will be more accurate and also that she will make clear her real interest in her subject matter . gypsy rose , i guess we both made the same mistake : trusting someone like ms. shteit to help us tell a story who did n't have the heart or the skills to pull it off

music pos 736.txt this is one of my favorites of 2004. you got a seasoned vet of an mc rockin over some of the illest producers in underground hip hops beats ( madlib , j-zone , dangermouse ) and some pretty nice guest appearances . i have a couple of complaints on this album though , like the song " love thang " , the hook is wack and the beat is corny , another wack hook comes thru on the title track where you got prince po sounding like tonto from lone ranger chanting some indian ish , and on top of that in his rhyme he says some sh*t like " and if the girl farts then she 's a pooter " ? ? ? thats dumb . one last complaint then i 'm done hatin , but the chorus on bump bump is terrible , and i 'm embarrased to bump bump that ish when i 'm in my car because it sounds so wack , but raekwon 's verse takes me back to when wu tang was the untouchable squad they were back in the mid 90 's , which more than makes up for the lackluster chorus . aside from those complaints you got a dope album , j-zone hit this up with some of best beats i 've ever heard from him . so pick this up its definitely a good purchase
software pos 632.txt i have used this product for over a year now . the reason i bought it was for the back up software . email was a secondary consideration . let me talk about the back up for a moment . it is quick to download and about that easy to start using . the set up can be done in two ways . either by default , or manual . i chose the default version which covers my home folders and it automatically backs up everything to my external hard drive at a time of my choosing . it will also set up a seperate version of a back up of vital stuff to an online storage for you that you get when you buy .mac as well . restoring a lost file could n't be easier . just click on restore and the locate the file ( or files ) you want to restore . the program is set up so that everything is named exactly as you originally named it on your hard drive . you do n't have to look for your file name in a long string of code . just select it and click restore . it will either put it in the exact place of your old file or in new location of your choosing . i have n't really messed with the other features yet , but the email is spam free and has been my default email for over a year now with out any problems . hope you buy the service and will enjoy it as much as i have

dvd pos 946.txt we must thank the director and salute sigourney weaver 's beautiful performance : this movie gives us a rare insight into the lives and minds of the gentle , yet ferocious , giant mountains gorillas . it is also the amazing journey of an extroardinary woman who went to live by herself in a remote mountain of rwanda , secluded from the world . she lost much of her sanity , as well as her life , in the process of saving the lives of a few hundred remaining gorillas . without her work , who knows who could have saved them from savage murder and total extinction ? thanks to her work and dedication , a " lost cause " had been heard at last . the struggle for the survival of the " great apes " is not totally over though . one must hope that the abject poverty and the political unrest that still affect the region , as well as the illegal poaching and smuggling of goods and animals across borders - that happen with or without government officials ' approval in each country involved - and the continuing deforestation and fauna 's loss of habitat , can one day all come to an end so that the survival of these amazing creatures can be achieved . one must recognize the sacrifices and thank people like diane fossey , conservationists around the world , and the rwandese people in particular , who have made it possible so far despite great internal economic and political pressures . all hope is not lost !

camera pos 125.txt after way too much time infront of a pc reading reviews or a camera store counter ( damn i was sick of it ) , this d80 is what i chose . bought it 2 weeks ago and then went on a 10 day trip west . after draging it everywhere i has not let me down . for the price its perfect . i 'm still working out exactly how to make it work to its potential aswell as fighting understanding of other manufacturers camera layouts in my head ) at work i have a rebel xt i bought last year as i need its compact casing . my brother has the canon d30 after he progressed from the xt and a friend on the west coast has the d200. having experience both i still love what i chose . my biggest reason however for going again with nikon was that i already have a n6006 film camera with a lens and my hope was i could use its nikkor af 35-105mm with this camera and give myself more options . after reading lots of reviews as to whether this was possible and finally taking the lens to a shop i found it worked fine . experience in the field in the last 10 days has shown it does not work seemlessly buy that may well be me not the lens . the 2.5 inch lcd is sooo much easier to read than the rebel xt . the info read out on top is much better placed than the one above the lcd on the xt ( if obstructed in an architectural model shoot and i ca n't see through the viewfinder myself , i certainly ca n't see the info screen if its below it ) . i did n't go with the 18-135 in the end for a lens as there is a vinyetting issue at the high end which bothered me . i got a great deal for the same price at cameraland in new hampshire for the d80 and the ( d70s ) 18-70mm tried and trusted lens . fab . now need to save up and wait for the release of the 80-300 vr lens thats coming out . would love the 80-400 vr but its 3 times the price . my hardest time was finiding someone with it in stock , at a price i wanted to pay , the set up i wanted and who was n't trying to make a dodgie deal ( like some of those cheap web based places in nyc ) .it really was the hardest part of the purchase in the end . i was surprised . many people were almost reluctant to make a sale . it was wierd . parts are hard to get too apparently like a spare battery and very few places have the 18-135 lens instock either . anyway enjoy your purchase if you choose this camera . i hope it takes many great pictures for you .

books neg 794.txt many of the columns were interesting . . . painting a picture of a vast right-ring conspiracy that hillary clinton first brought to the public discourse . but it seems that most of these pieces are obsolete , without any interest either as themselves or as a theme . does anyone care about texas state politics in 1989 , or phil gramm 's problems as a senator or as a presidential candidate ? someone should have gone through this and culled out what was obsolete .. except that that would probably have left less material than would make up a book . just going through a bunch of previously written columns and passing them off as a book may be a cheap and easy way to publish something but it is an inadequate read
books pos 185.txt i 've always read lots of books about singles and how to find a mate , and that rate has sped up since i 'm now a romance coach . but somehow i had missed susan page 's " if i 'm so wonderful , why am i still single ? " even though it has been out since 1998 , the last year i was single myself . where have i been , and why had n't i seen this book ? susan page writes for " involuntary singles " - - straight , gay , male or female , each and every one of us who is single and wishes we weren't . relentlessly positive , she starts off right to the point with " so why are you still single anyway ? " and then , just when we 've gotten over that shock , she states flatly : " whatever your reasons are for being single , if you want to be in a relationship , no reason is good enough . " then page goes about tearing apart every good reason we 've ever come up with to keep ourselves single . here 's what page takes on and turns around : ambivalence ( my favorite ) , those " dreadful statistics , " the myth of " there are no good ways to meet people , " and having and keeping high standards . then she works on developing skills in what she calls " frog kissing " : learning to say no , how to recognize true intimacy , avoiding " commitmentphobes , " handling the intimacy gap , and learning to say " yes . " and in the last section , " keeping it all together while you look , " page tells you just how to do all that . this is easily the best , most thorough , rounded and positive book about relationships and dating i have seen . if you are one of page 's " involuntary singles , " this book needs to be in your library . five chocolate dipped strawberries for susan page ! this is quite a book .

dvd pos 297.txt it embarrases me that i , a music man , have let this many years go by without reviewing this splendid movie . my wife rented it from a hasting 's video store back when dvds were not widely distributed . i was in awe of the movie as it ended because i had no clue what to expect , and i was n't expecting much anyway . richard dreyfuss plays the role of glenn holland , a recent college graduate who takes the job of a music teacher to provide an income ( he calls it a ' fall back position ' ) while he writes what he hopes will be a musical masterpiece that will make him rich and famous . his first semester is a trying and learning experience as students see him as that school teacher everybody hated and whose class everyone dreaded . but he finds his way into the students ' hearts . the movie begins in the early 1960s , and rock ' n ' roll has etched a permanent mark on the music landscape . most of the students , of course , love the new music . realizing he has an ' in ' with the students , he makes an accurate comparison by playing bach 's " minuet in g " ( for anna magdalena ) and asking the students what song it is . they reply it is the " lovers concerto " by the toys ( " what color is the rain that falls softly on my window. . " ) . he notes they are wrong and that it is actually the same song ( although he does n't note that bach 's is in 3 / 4 and the toys in 4 / 4 ) and is an example of an ancient music scale called the dorian scale . he now has them right where he wants them . along the way , he continues to work on his masterpiece . but life , a new baby who turns out to be deaf , and the need for new things put his life on hold . as he notes by quoting john lennon , " life is what happens while you 're making other plans " ( or some facsimile thereof ) . years continue to go by and events occur that happen in the life of virtually ever music teacher . he has that one student who has a lot of heart but not a lot of ability - yet needs to get an hour of credit so he can remain eligible to play football . he has another student who wants to play the clarinet but is nervous . yet he always comes back to the simple rock ' n ' roll to make his point about ' real ' music . but reality plays hide and seek sometimes . he has it out with his wife about their deaf son - and his frustrations come to a boiling point on the night john lennon is killed . over time , they become friends - and one of the sweet sights of the movie is the son feeling the vibrations from the speaker as he ' hears ' the music . but another reality awaits - education budget cuts , and here dreyfuss delivers the line with outstanding effect : " the day they cut the football budget in this state...well , that will certainly be the end of western civilization as we know it . " it is in the presence of his now good friend , jay thomas ( the football coach ) , that he talks about how he never wanted to teach but now that is all he wants to do . the music track in this movie is awesome . there 's just one thing i 'm still trying to figure out : how did the students manage to mass distribute his music and practice it without him knowing it ?
camera neg 837.txt i received this monitor as a baby shower gift , but it was something i had particularly wanted . i was extremely disappointed when i found it did n't work at all ! there is so much sound interference it 's impossible to tell if the noises are the baby or the interference . we disconnected every electronic appliance in the house ( cordless phone , microwave , even turned off our cell phones ) and still the interference was there . the video reception is awful , supposed to be up to 300 feet , we are only roughly 20 feet away and still the picture is terrible . i swear it was supposed to have " night vision " - forget it , non-existent . i 'm off the video monitoring ; i 'm on-line now to buy an old-fashioned voice monitor

books pos 169.txt this book captures the human spirit , at both its best and its worst . schwarz-bart is a masterful author in his telling of the tale of ernie levy , from birth and on . he also , shows us the readers the cruelty of nature that was the nazi movement . it is unfortunate that so many people had to suffer so much through history as did the jewish people . it is one might say not a fair trade for normal life to be a just man , although without them humanity would crumble , as future readers will find out their importance . and if there really are just men in our world...we really owe them a great deal of thanks for taking the pains of the world on their shoulders
camera neg 244.txt i purchased this camera based on previous good experience with an older model fujifilm camera , reviews here , price and functions . at the same time , i also purchased the larger xd card . almost out of the box , this camera has given me nothing but grief . what others had said about the blurry photos i can certainly echo . a month or so after purchase , the lens would not open , or it would not open totally . i first thought the batteries were dead and that was the cause....after changing the batteries , the problems still existed - some of the time . not always - just sporadically . just enough to cause me to miss many unique and memorable photo opportunities . in addition to that , now that i 'm looking at other brands of cameras i find the xd card i purchased is not transferable so i 'm out the cost of that as well . another malfunction of this camera is after " erasing " all photos on the xd card , taking more photos and uploading the new photos , i found that all the photos originally erased were still there and uploaded again with the new ones ? i do n't know if that was a camera or memory card malfunction but it just added to my dislike of this camera . i would not recommend this camera to anyone....it 's a total dud . i 'm very disappointed with fujifilm and am now looking at nikon and cannons . good luck fujifulm...you need it
dvd neg 867.txt having just read the book ( most highly recommended ) i decided to treat myself to the movie . i could have cried . while i did not expect the movie to contain everything from the book , i was sadly dissapointed to see that it totally changed the plot around . in the book , the 5 men bonded together and were great men of character . in the movie , they got rid of one man , had the other eaten right off the bat , pencroft is shown to be a coward and greedy . in the book , nemo appears only in the last two or three chapters , and he does not have an elaborate home on the island . and what about those stupid giant animals ? i do n't recall reading about them . the fence around nemo 's home looks like it came right from jurassic park . the whole story was about 5 ( eventually 6 ) men who were stranded on an uncharted island and the wonderful adventures they had there . on another note , the graphics were pretty bad . the panning was very blurry and the picture was often grainy . as one reviewer well said , it is suitable for children who are easily pleased , but it is nothing like the book . perhaps this is why amazon sells it for only $6.99

dvd neg 168.txt i idiotilcy got this dvd because of colin firth , and , as you can see , it sucks . btw , this is not " prasadjonnalagadda " but rather his daughter , he just comes to buy crap , but never reads the reviwes . anyways , i had better time watching a syndicated simpsons ' episode than watching this bomb . at first , i thought that this movie might 've had some potential because of the suberb stars : colin firth and minnie driver ( good will hunting , won an oscar for it ) i did not yet know heather grahm , but after this movie , i hate her now ! i will admit , she was alright up until she got drunk in the car . that . was . annying beyond reason . other than that , the film 's set up is absolutly horrible , starting off with colin coming to a town just because it 's called hope ? and falling in love with someone only after a couple of days ? and there is also the horrible music that does n't fit the mood at all whenever they play at the scene . pepole , i originnaly gave this a 2 star for colin and minnie , but heather is responsible for everything else .

books pos 891.txt richard fortney 's " earth " is a survey , in mostly layman 's terms , of the geological history of the earth and how it relates to humankind . fortney tells the story by means of a journey around the earth , selecting a series of locations where the earth 's geology is apparent , and usually the meaning of that geology was debated by scholars to a greater understanding . fortney starts at mount vesuvius in italy , preceeds to the hawaiian islands , hence to the swiss alps and to other locations aroudn the world . fortney relates the geology of each chosen location to plate tectonics as a means to explain how each terrain come to be the way it is . this leads into extended and sometimes fascinating discussions of the former alignements of the continents in prior ages such as the " supercontinent " of gondwana . for each location , fortney also relates the effects of the terrain on the history of the humans who have lived in that location . along the way , fortney drives home the sheer vastness of the timescale of earth and its geological processes . the dedicated reader will view his landscape with a new perspective . fortney is a gifted writer with a good eye for the illustrative anecdote . large portions of this book will be fascinating to the reader with at least some schooling in the sciences . it turns out , for example , that the complicated geology of newfoundland results from its origin as pieces of three different tectonic plates ( north america , ocean bottom , and northern europe ) . the descriptions of northwest scotland as the remains of truly ancient mountains are put into appropriate scale in part by fortney 's historical anecdotes and by his experiences of rockhounding in the often cold rainy weather of the scottish highlands . the narrative runs a little long at over 400 pages , and fortney 's explanations will sometimes outrun the scientific background of the average reader . nevertheless , this book is highly recommended to the reader with at least a casual interest in geology and its links to human history

books neg 603.txt if you like unimaginative phony crap you 'll love this book . the proposed animals within this book are utterly stupid and improbable . an antelope that feels through the snow with its incredibly dumb looking antlers ? a diurnal and terrestrial mammal that for some god-forsaken reason lacks eyes of any kind ? primates that do n't evolve to fit man 's niche , but instead take on the roles of otters and flying squirrels ? the thing has got nonsense written all over it . the " future animals " proposed for this book were not well thought out and somebody , please find mr. dixon a liguist , and fast ! some of the names he gives these future animals are so stupidly childish that they actually detract from a creature 's plausibility . a vortex ? a posset ? what jerk scientist of the future is naming these things ? can he please be institutionalized ? i admit the pictures were well done and pre-teen children would probably enjoy this immensely . i know i would 've when i was 10 or 11 , and there 's nothing wrong with that , it 's just that dougal dixon begins the book in a very advanced scientific way discussing food pryramids , chains of evolution , and ecological niches , but then converts to unscientific baloney around page 30. all in all , i just do n't think it 's cut out for people over the age of 12 or so , unless you are just looking for fun and imaginative creatures . but in that case , why restrict your mind with the laws of evolution ? why not pick up a copy of the dungeons and dragons monster manual or something like that with lots of mythological and imaginary creatures ? i find that books intended to showcase the fantastic , do much better outside the realm of ( somewhat-boring ) science

camera neg 724.txt i was extremely disappointed with this camera . it 's a shame there is no option for zero stars , because it does n't even deserve one . i bought two of them for a vacation to belize because we were planning to do a lot of activities in and around the water , and we were hoping to capture those memories without risk to our digital camera . now i really regret not putting a little more money into a waterproof case for our digital camera rather than wasting money on this camera and developing pictures that were only worthy of the garbage can . all of the pictures from both cameras were very grainy - terrible , terrible quality . the camera that we took pictures with while diving was slightly better than the one we never even submerged in the water . those pictures were so grainy that we could n't even tell what the pictures were supposed to be of . extremely disappointing for a camera that was n't even submerged in water . not to mention both cameras said that there were more pictures left on the roll when there were none , so we took shots that we thought were going to be really amazing only to find that they were n't even on the negatives . i was so disappointed in this camera that i wrote to kodak and they offered to send me two new disposable cameras . unfortunately our trip to belize was a once in a lifetime trip , so i have absolutely no need for replacements - the damage is done . and i have no desire to ever use one of these cameras again . if you are planning on using a disposable waterproof camera for capturing valuable memories , do not waste your money on this one . the only thing you will receive from the photo lab is disappointment . i wish i had done more research before purchasing this one - please do n't even bother with it

music pos 48.txt the series of " golden age of american rock & roll " released by ace could n't have a better end . during the past 15 years they have delighted us with a series of 10 cd 's with 30 songs each remembering the rock & roll era mostly with minor top hits between 1954 and 1963. one reason for their tremendous success is the superb quality of all the recordings no matter from what year the original song was . now besides these series of 10 cd 's from the r&r era they have launched another 2 special editions with the same title : one with the special novelty edition and another with the special country edition . both deserve more than 5 stars . the song selection on the novelty edition is just out of sight ! most of the songs brought back memories from a long long time ago since these were n't available after the time they were top hits . i never found them back on what compilation so ever until ace put them all together 45 years later . and with a sound quality better than in their original version on 45rpm . therefore do n't hesitate . buy it together with the country edition and you will have 60 songs for utmost pleasure ; 60 songs we grew up with and now with no scratches on them .

camera pos 421.txt overall , i am quite satisfied with the usability and photo quality of the canon a 710 is . this camera was an upgrade from my 3-year-old hp 935 - - the old guy still worked fine , but was very slow and did n't handle low-light situations very well at all . i was also looking for a bigger zoom range . after weighing the options , i decided that the a 710 is was the way to go . pros : - uses standard aa batteries . invaluable when you 're on the go and need more juice . also , the battery life has been very good - i 'm using the same aa rechargables i used for over a year in my old camera , and i routinely get 2-4 days usage from them before needing to recharge . - huge lcd screen that does n't suck power . fast response , too . - digital zoom that actually helps ! because the camera is 7.1 mp and has an image stabilizer , i can actually get usable images even at the full 24x combined zoom . very impressed . - very wide range of available settings . you can customize almost any aspect of this camera , from sounds to shutter speed to flash speed / brightness to focus to... . - big enough , and small enough . it will fit in my back pocket most of the time , but it 's big enough to remind me that it 's there before i sit down . - fast processing time . taking a 3 or 4 minute video and having it ready to go again in less than 5 seconds is a true novelty to me - - my old hp took forever ! the fast processor also helps in viewing the images on the camera - you can scroll through very quickly , and also jump to an image very quickly too . much better than previous canon models even . - memory backup battery . remembers what day it is , time it is , and what image you 're on - - even if you take the regular aa 's out . very useful . - fast start-up time . it 's ready to take a picture right after you turn it on , especially if you bypass the " welcome " image sound and screen . - cool features , like color swap and color select . also , there 's an option for when the camera is connected to your computer to set any image as your computer 's wallpaper with just the press of a button on the camera . the camera also allows you to use the digital zoom while taking video , a nice touch . - you can change lenses and add filters very easily . cons : - as i mentioned earlier , one of the reasons i upgraded from the hp was to have better luck with low-light situations . i 've had the camera now for just over a month , and i still have n't figured out the best setting for clear , low-light photos - - something that was very easy to do with older canon models , say , the a 510. as mentioned , there is a wide range of settings available , which can also be a negative if you do n't know quite what you 're looking for . - no " action " setting . similar to above , the one setting i miss the most from other canons is that action setting . this camera requires you to set it manually . - video file sizes . a typical 4-minute clip can run upwards of 200 mb - - making it almost impossible to send via email or upload anywhere online . also takes up a good chunk of a 1mb memory card , really quickly . canon would have done better to use mpeg-4 here instead of avi . - similarly , the video quality does n't reflect the large file size in most cases , though the sound quality is very good . - the big lcd is great , but is very hard to see outside in the sun . it does have a backup optical viewfinder , but using that puts your nose up against that lcd and leaves a nice smudge on it if you 're not careful . - buttons are still somewhat confusing after a month of use , but that 's relatively minor and will undoubtedly pass with time . - bundled software does not offer the ability to resize your images - - i have to go back through the old hp software if i want to take an image down from 3000 pixels wide to 600 ! overall , as mentioned , the camera is a huge improvement from my old hp , and even with all of those little annoyances , i 'm sure the camera would be a perfect fit for pretty much any amateur-to-intermediate photog . it 's no slr , but it 's getting there . and , you certainly ca n't beat the price
health neg 279.txt the scale is everything the manufacturer claims . however , with minimal use by one average sized adult , our scale lasted only about nine months . the balance part of the scale is very sound , but the battery clip that powers the electronics is poorly designed and built of very cheap components . i suspect that poor q&a will result in a fairly high percentage of these units failing and recommend that you go elsewhere . today , my scale will not function unless i hold the batteries by hand ( not too practical when someone is standing on it.. . ) . conclusions : * scale design is nice- -looks good . * construction of balance components is solid , glass is very strong . design and construction of the power unit ( battery ) is rather poor . * scale functions as advertised for a normal sized ( 80kg / 175lb ) adult ... until the battery power clip dies . * buyers should avoid this scale in favor of something with more solid battery compartment and connections . hope this helps !
health pos 894.txt i purchase two of the eva-dry edv-500 renewable dehumidifer and hang them inside the closet where i store my photo gears . although in california is not so humid but little moisture do add up . this dehumidifer is so easy to use - - unwrap it then hang it there . i check them once per several day . when the silica gel change from blue to pick , i just recharge it by plug it into the electric outlet overnight , then next morning , wow , a renewed dehumidifer is ready to use again . the changing of color is very obviously . i strongly recommend this item

camera pos 283.txt i own several canon lens for my 20d and this is hands down the best . i had a 28-135 which was a very good lens regardless of some reviews , and i got many excellent photos with it - this is distinctly better in all ways . ( of course , it costs a lot more ) . recently went with the grandchildred to sea world and i got 100% good photos , with several really outstanding ones . it is light , accurate and has is - what more do you want ? you can replace a slew of lens with this one and perhaps selling the old ones will help pay for it . bought it as soon as it was available and have not regretted it one moment . if you have one lens , this is the one

software neg 25.txt this is the first time i have ever reviewed a product and i do it so that no one else will waste their money on this . it adds virtually nothing to xp . too bad they did n't make it as interesting as their packaged media edition . that would have been worth the money , but old bill who does n't want to be the richest man in the world would rather you spend money on a new pc to get that product . the themes are nice but far too few for the price . the games are a gimmick since you have to pay to play the real things . the dj is dumb and the dancers are cute but after a while boring . hard to figure out how to use the music converter and photo stuff . too bad could have been something but in its present form , not worth the money

dvd pos 174.txt argento is an incarnation of everything that film is and everything that it could have been as conceived by lumiere . after hitchcock and ray , leone and fuller , argento is the last true auteur to make genre films . visually , a film like profondo rosso calls upon the ghosts of the cinema because everything that is filmed , objects and people alike , take on the same importance and that this inevitably leads to the resolution of the mystery which is at the center of the film . argento can only film something as itself and this is why he is an extraordinary filmmaker . cinema is not an answer but a question and argento is the answer to eisenstein 's theory of film as violence , violence not only in the images themselves but in the great void that awaits them . a murder , a painting , a mother , a son , a mirror , all of these things will lead to a beautiful composition of images in which the mystery of seeing , the mystery of cinema , the questions , are resolved .
software neg 87.txt yeah , i know it 's the industry standard , and it 's powerful , and all that stuff . but , my god , what a freaking pain to use . it 's just plain tedious to draw anything from scratch . while the interface in cs2 is an improvement , doing relatively simple drawings with primitive shapes and freehand curves still requires much more effort than it reasonably should . frankly , i could draw better stuff faster with 1990's -era macintosh drawing programs . the drawing issues are compounded by the fact that - - in true adobe spirit - - this program is incredibly bloated and slow . it 's slow doing everything.. . i 've never seen a program so slow starting up . and every time you save a file ( even a tiny drawing with 10 shapes ) you get a " saving file " progress bar for a few seconds . it 's also incredibly slow to shut down.. . frequently taking about 30 seconds . i 'm running it on a pentium m laptop , and i know this is not a " graphics professional " machine , but come on ! let 's get the lead out ! i just get the sense that adobe pays no attention whatsoever to efficiency or speed . that bugs me a lot
health neg 166.txt i do n't know where amazon got these cases of all small & mighty , free clear . i use the same product all the time purchased from my local superstores and grocery stores and love it . from my local retailers the product has no scent and is the consistency of shampoo . the amazon case is gelatinous and smells like latex paint . it also disturbed me that the bottles are packaged differently than the local store version . at the store they have a shrink wrap label and a large cap for a dripless spout . the amazon case has sticker labels on the same shape bottle and a small cap on a non-dripless spout . at first i called the manufacturer . their customer service seemed concerned but then managed to drop my call . so i decided to use it . i do not notice any difference in the cleanliness level of my clothes . i would not purchase this again from amazon . the price is not that great to overcome the odd differences . i will , however , continue to purchase this product from my local retailers

camera neg 79.txt this is my third digital camera , i bought it after my tot dunked my previous camera under water . i did a lot of research before i bought this and it was highly rated in consumer reports . after a few months of ok pictures ( the macro setting is not very good though ) the lens cover started sticking but i learned to live with it . i would manually open up the lens cover each time . then the lens cover got stuck in the open position and i was learning to live with that . but now the camera is almost completely dead . it will not power up properly and sometimes it beeps . i 'm not sure but i think i am out of the warranty period with this . i will not buy another canon camera . this camera was made too cheaply . i wish things were not made to break right away

health pos 67.txt i 'm writing to correct a few factual errors in other reviews . one reviewer claimed that soldier fuel contains no energy ingredients . this is untrue . soldier fuel was formulated by military labs specifically to provide steady energy to troops . carbohydrates are the body 's primary source of energy . soldier fuel contains 29 g of complex carbs ( the carbs that give long-lasting energy ) and 12 g of sugar . the u.s. military labs deemed this the perfect ratio to give you both a quick burst of energy and no crash . most other energy drinks on the market have lots of sugar and caffeine . since caffeine is a stimulant and not a source of energy , the result is a quick spike in energy followed by a crash . another error is that soldier fuel has more sugar . it has less . one 12 oz . can of soldier fuel has 12 g of sugar . the same amount of gatorade contains 21 g of sugar . the same amount of red bull has 39g sugar . finally , the support for the troops is not marketing hype . our company is partnered with the u.s. military 's natick soldier center . a portion of the gross proceeds from each can of hooah ! soldier fuel and each hooah ! bar directly funds research that improves the safety , diet , and quality of life of our troops

books neg 101.txt [the above is an actual quote from the book] i do n't usually read romances , but got this one at the library . i thought : thriller . hijacked plane , navy seal...all the right stuff . and the beginning was promising . stan fixes everything , and has a human side to him that was compelling . then the plot hit the fan ! as a thriller it stunk . the highjacking was interwoven into the plot weakly , as an after thought . the romantic " tension " between the protagonists was forced and irritating . the dialogue is mundane . the message that horniness leads to true romantic ( sam and alyssa ) love is rubbish . the only worthwhile character was the highjacked girl , and i think it was brave of the author to not have her come out unscathed . the historic ( wwii ) componant was interesting . but overall , i kept asking who the audience is for this book . not lovers of thrillers like me- -and i wonder , do romance readers even care about a highjacked plane , or was that just getting in the way of wondering whether teri will ever tell sam that she loves him !
camera pos 168.txt the canon rs-60e3 is all that canon says it is....it is a simple one handed operation switch that can open the flash , focus , then release the shutter once , a multiple of times , or hold it open for bulb exposure . although the cord is not long enough to include the photographer in the picture , it was simple enough to make an " extension " that allows for very remote exposures
software neg 473.txt they changed everything ! in an effort to make it more user friendly , they 've rearranged most of the controls . menus are replaced by headings . it is difficult to accomplish what were easy changes before . some of this will likely improve with use . word 2007 is constantly trying to think for you , auto formatting as you type . however , it often is n't thinking what you are , and making it obey your commands is frustrated by the new headings . particularly frustrating , when i " right-click " on a list to restart numbering at " a " ( ie . after roman numeral ii on an outline ) , word 2007 flatly refuses . my research paper is now formated : i . heading a . subpoint b . subpoint c . subpoin ii . heading d . subpoint e . subpoint f . subpoint iii . heading g . subpoint etc....etc.. . this is ridiculous and inexcusable ! i also had to individually superscript 130+ footnotes . somehow , in changing the font from the widows default " calibri " back to " time new roman , " the footnote setting was altered and i have yet to determine how to restore it . however , if i open a new document it is fine , but i really do n't want to retype a 30+ page research paper . powerpoint 2007 works well enough , compared to the older version . they have added a few bell and whistles , but nothing that gets in the way . if you have to buy a new computer you 're likely stuck with the new ms office 2007. but do n't buy it until you have to . it is not an upgrade from the previous two versions
software pos 661.txt i received my emedia piano and keyboard method today and it 's not a bad program by any means , however i have two gripes with the software : first , either the " full screen " option in preferences does n't work or emedia feels that 640x480 counts as a full screen , so if you have your monitor set at a higher resolution ( and what mac user does n't ? ) you 'll need to lower it in order to read the lessons ' text , and since you most likely wo n't be sitting as close to your laptop / monitor during these lessons , this is kind of important . second , you need to have the program cd in your computer to get the sound and video to play , and the whine of my optical drive is mildly annoying while trying to study / practice . there are workarounds to bypass this type of copyright protection silliness , but it makes me mad that i need to resort to doing this . if emedia 's so paranoid about theft of their product , why do n't they just stream the program 's media portion from their website ? at least it would n't be noisy that way . other than these two flaws , the program is excellent for self-starters like me . plus it seems to be the only complete , low-cost piano / keyboard instruction software out there for mac osx . i would have wrote this review after a few weeks of lessons instead of my first day learning but the optical-drive issue really bothered me .

books neg 239.txt i had never read a danielle steel book before , and decided to give her a try , given that she is so popular and has so many books published . i was pretty disappointed . i agree with the other reviewers that the plot is unrealistic ; however , if a book is unrealistic but well-written and engaging , i would still like it . i think the biggest problem with this book is the author 's excessive repetitiveness . yes , i get that this character is really cold and unloving- --that was already covered 50 pages ago ! in addition , character traits could have been better conveyed through situations , rather than simply stating , " so and so was a devoted mother " and repeating this fact again and again and again . these flaws in the author 's writing kept me skipping through whole sections of the book . this book did not leave me wanting to read more of ms. steel 's books . it is an ok book if you like romance and very easy , repetitive reading .

books neg 953.txt i have studied the tarot for nearly 5 years and keep an open mind whenever a new book appears on the market . edain mccoy , who has written some wonderful new age material , strikes an off-putting note in this one . the spreads are certainly imaginative and are perhaps insightful to her own method of tarot interpretation , but convey confusing and ambiguous directions to the reader who is trying to understand her card placements . in several of her spreads she conveys that a card 's placement at a certain point in the spread " may or may not " mean some karmic element at play . the whole exercise of creating a spread is to pinpoint with a degree of accuracy the situation you wish to define . therefore , when a card " may or may not " mean something , that interpretation could significantly change on whether you " may or may not " interpret it that way , leaving the interpreter open to rationalizing a card 's meaning . tarot cards are intuitive , not rational , and their meanings can best be intuited when their placement is clearly defined without ambiguity it is difficult to have it both ways and i found working with these spreads difficult . imagine doing a celtic cross reading and the first position " may or may not " be the root of the issue . these spreads speak very clearly to the author , but not so to the reader . i rate it 2 stars for depth and insight into karma and past lives , but the explanations are too ambiguous .

books neg 938.txt as a follower of the celebration story for many years , i was greatly disappointed by what i thought would be a new and interesting perspective on the model town . it was nothing of the sort . the book had the feel of so many pages of anti-disney propaganda , and the repetitiveness of a bad serial . the authors of celebration u.s.a. clearly made up their minds about celebration long before signing off on a mortgage . lacking in the detail needed to illustrate celebration 's experiment with the tenets of neotraditional style , the book offered splashes of cliched generalities such as " a return to the past " and " recapturing tradition . " it soon became some sort of mantra exhorting disney 's ownership of the town , the rules imposed on property improvements and maintenance , and , interestingly , the attention the town received . most tactless of all was the shadow of mockery cast on every description of residents , conversation with neighbors , and interaction with people doing what the authors should have been doing : giving the town a chance
music neg 49.txt neither the amazon review or any of the customer reviews recently submitted mention this fact . i have few classical and pop recordings in mono that do not impact the listening experience such as ' songs for swinging lovers ' - frank sinatra or beethoven 's opera fidelio - conductor otto klemperer ( testament label ) . the material on these recordings are so good that the listener completely ignores the fact that they are mono recordings . i did not hear anything outstanding on this cd to make me overlook the ' mono ' factor . is this some great jazz masterpiece , recorded live in carnegie hall by two giants of jazz ? i personally do n't think so . somehow this material remained in obscurity for all this time and somebody by accident discovered this gem - if you believe that then elvis is alive and the earth is exactly 6000 years old . with small jazz bands , i like to listen to the musicians communicate with each other within the context of a thesis . examples : ' sunday at the village vanguard - bill evans trio ' or ' new york reunion - mccoy tyner quartet' . i wanted to but could not hear anything of this sort in this recording . this material is more likely to be understood only by the performers themselves and the real jazz aficionados . it may have been hasty but after one listen i decided to sell this cd and i have no regrets other than buying it in the first place .
software neg 347.txt i 'm in the midst of auditioning lcd panels and the local isf certified guy wants $350 per panel to calibrate them . i like tv and everything , but there 's just no way that i am going to spend $350 on tv that i might possibly keep . still , the store settings on any two panels have two problems . first , they are amped up beyond compare as the tv vendors compete to be " who 's the brightest " on the lit showroom floor . sitting in my living room , they are far far too bright to watch . second , they display colors totally differently . it 's just hard to compare to 2 sets that are calibrated so differently . now the tvs that we are looking at cost a pretty penny , and it seemed that a couple of hundred dollars to inform the decision was a good idea , just like the hundred dollars for an hdmi splitter seemed like a good idea . the splitter was a good idea , the spyder tv colormeter not so much . i calibrated 2 panels with this product . two things are true about the calibrations . first , they do not look at all the same . the sony panel has red shifted flesh tones while the sharp looks cold and sterile . second , they look way way worse than before the calibration . after 20 minutes of watching casino royale , it was time to revert back to a toned down version of the factory defaults for each . at first i thought that i had not followed the instructions right . maybe it was not dark enough . maybe the sensor was not positioned right . having done the process several times , i can state categorically that while the colorvision spyder tv may not deliver good results , it is consistent in its delivery of bad results . i simply cannot recommend this product

music neg 961.txt zoolook~ jean-michel jarre is a case where the artist is way to avant-garde for his own best . after having made amazing albums such as oxygene , equinox and magnetic fields he unfortunately creates this mess of an album . i find it a bit too much like modern art , i.e. , confusing , confounding and impossible to grasp . it also seems like jarre was a bit over confident when he recorded this album . he had recorded some of the best synth albums of all time and decided to create a total arts album and it just does not work . this is an album that should have stayed unrealesed since it is just to avant-garde and sounds more like an experimental sound session rather then as a well produced album . very disapointing indeed !

camera pos 762.txt i have been using this scope on the beach at night to monitor sea turtle nesting . when up close , the image is excellent , but not so good for far away ( more than 100-200 ft ) . very easy to use , and the fact that it 's waterproof is a plus ( have n't dropped it in the ocean yet ! ) . you ca n't really get a feel for how good the image is in a residential area , but out on the beach , with the moonlight , it rocks . most of the time i do n't even need the ir illuminator . to save power , turn it off , and it will still provide an image with the available light for almost 5 minutes . if you 're looking to see things that are far away , this scope wo n't work well , but for things that are close by ( say , from one end of the backyard to the other ) it 's a good deal . i put mine in a hard sided padded carrying case , since it gets bounced around on the atv , and have n't had a problem yet
camera neg 919.txt i bought this camera for my 4yr old granddaughter who can handle my digital camera quite well and found it to be a total waste . the camera was much smaller than expected , trying to figure out what mode you 're in is ridiculous and the display is quite difficult to see let alone interpret . nothing is a simple " one step " procedure which you would expect for an item geared towards children . i was so frustrated setting it up that i did n't bother giving it to her . the software installed okay but was also far from " kid friendly " . i wish i would 've found and read these user opinions before making the purchase . ironically , the reviews i did see made it out to be better than the other cameras on the market for kids . i believe you 'd be better off purchasing a " regular " inexpensive digital camera for your potential " shutterbugs " .

books neg 96.txt the amount of violence in this book is excessive over relatively insignificant motives . i had a hard time believing all this was happening in 1948. i am not questioning mosley 's portrayal of racism . however , i did a little research into just how violent place los angeles was in 1948 , and the answer is not very . there may have been poverty , racism , alcholism , but l.a. county seemed pretty safe ; the late 1940s had some of the lowest homicide rates since as far back as one researcher was able to find , 1827 ! mosley may have been more familiar with l.a. of the 1970s and 1980s and just assumed that it had always been that way . throw in speakeasies , gangsters hijacking liquor trucks , and one gets the impression that mosley is confusing the 1948 with 1928. i am not so pedantic as to insist that fiction be historically accurate . but many , many people hail mosley for depicting a dark side of life / era / place that had not been shown before . from what i can tell , he has simply combined stereotypes from the 1920s and 1970s ( i guess those years average to be about 1948 ) . mosley is depicting a fantasy world of his own creation . however , i doubt he ever tried to pass it off as authentic , and i hope readers realize that it is not . easy rawlins in this novel falls into the rather weak , but unfortunately large , group of fictional detectives that actually accomplish little detecting . a detective actually solves a mystery using his own intellect ; that is interesting to read . detectives in less skilled hands solve mysteries via confession . easy does solve one of the murders on his own , but just about everything he " solves " is simply confessed to him . i find that extremely dissatisfying . mosley has packed the book with violence , but seems to know very little about violence himself . none of the fights are well described . easy , for being a self-professed " killing machine " ca n't actually fight worth a damn and is surrounded by guns but does not apparently know anything about them . they are either big or they are small . he does not come of as being hard-boiled , but rather a pathetic braggart mosley does show signs of being a very good writer . but i think he is too far over his head in this genre to come up with something exceptional . i imagine that his work must have improved , but this effort is nothing to get exceited over . and again , i do n't obsess over accuracy , but a little bit of research would have gone a long way in firming the foundation of this novel .
books neg 124.txt i started reading this immediately after the last reh compilation and there could not be a greater difference in story telling . while reh was first and foremost a story teller , pressfield uses one of the absolute worst devices in his recount of a grandson of his grandfather 's remembering his conversations with a client who knew the famous alcibiades . this , as previous reviewers have mentioned , creates a large gap between reader and story . but why do this ? why use such a crappy method of story telling ? i guess it pads the book with unnecessary dialogue . all in all , it 's a slow , uninspired , day dream story . so crappy that i felt it necessary to write this review echoing previous harsh reviews . i want my money back

dvd neg 42.txt it is obvious that this movie is full of lies . although i have not actually seen it , i know this to be true because i have seen many discussions on the movie on the fox news channel ( god bless them ! ) . the way he attacks poor mr. heston is deplorable . ca n't michael moore tell from the comments charlton made at the rallies that he does n't have his faculties about him ? i am also unsure that mr. heston even said the things that the movie shows him saying . the ability of hollywood to manipulate and edit sound is truly amazing , making it appear that my president ( heston ) is an uncaring , babbling idiot by simply using his own words - shame on you michael ! and as for the way he got the gun from the bank , i agree with the other posters that the entire point of a bank giving away free guns is completely nullified by the fact that they did n't give him the gun the minute he walked into the bank . bravo to those who figured that out . also , michael moore is fat . take that pinkie

camera pos 307.txt i 've had this camera for about 1 1 / 2 years now and it 's been a tried and true companion . i 've easily taken over 10 , 000 shots with it and produced some really exceptional photographs . the features that really set this camera apart are the 12x zoom , the image stabilization ( a must with such a large zoom ) , and the rotating screen ( great if you want to take a picture of yourself : ) ) . i also love the macro mode , i 've gotten some great quality close-ups . for most situations you can just stick it in auto mode and get great results , but the different scene modes are fun to play with as well . performs extremely well outdoors - - wildlife , sports , landscape , beach , etc. my only real complaint is its performance in low-light situations . pictures are grainy and the camera is very slow to respond , sometimes not responding at all . also it can eat through batteries fairly quickly - - regular aa batteries lasted me about 2.5 hours of continuous shooting ( around 200 pictures ) or less if i was shooting in cold weather . i would definately recommend rechargable batteries . overall i 've really enjoyed this camera . i 've used and abused it and apart from low-light situations ( which i was rarely in anyway ) it never let me down . both my grandmother and my great aunt bought one within the past 6 months and they rave about it

music neg 603.txt with the greatest respect to the incredible bob beldon , joe zawinul , and wayne shorter , this box set should contain a warning . the warning is simple : if you already own most of the stuff in this collection , do n't bother . if you 're completely new to weather report , buy it . coming from someone that 's seen the band perform every year since 1972 and own all their official and quite a few " other " releases , i was really disappointed with this project ( except for the booklet ) . here are a few things that are puzzling : 1 ) a weather report box set includes three songs ( two composed by zawinul and one by shorter ) that were never released by weather report : a . in a silent way . released by miles davis b. super nova , released by wayne shorter c . experience in e ( excerpt ) , released by cannonball adderly ( i agree with the liner notes that point to these songs as pre-cursors , but mentioning them would have been enough - they are all in print ) 2 ) an incredible typo stating that alphonse mouzon was the drummer on " unknown soldier " 3 ) including a barely improved version of nubian sundance that has been in circulation for many years from " other " sources . 4 ) including another " better than , but not by much " version of the " other " sources for the 1978 rockpalast concert on dvd . 5 ) not remastering any of the original recordings . the tape hiss from the live in tokyo ( i sing the body electric ) songs is still clearly heard and not upgrading those old recordings is just plain unacceptable in this day and age . 6 ) finally , the cover itself - i have no words , except to admit " i do n't get it " . having said all that negative stuff - weather report remains the dominant " creative machine " of the jazz rock fusion era and those that missed it should buy this without hesitating . if you 're a long time weather report fan - there 's absolutely nothing to get excited about here . the dvd was especially disappointing to me . i have had that concert on vhs tape for many years and now on dvd ( all from " other " sources ) and was shocked to see such incredible video noise on the official version . zawinul 's black and white keys look like polka-dots in many places . ( i played the dvd in 5 different players ; two tv 's and my computer monitor to make sure it was n't my equipment ) . i should have paid attention to the pr person at sony that told me the concert was taken from a re-broadcast of the show and not from the master tapes . it 's my own fault for having unrealistic expectations . i should probably clarify that while the dvd is in fact clearly better than the " un-offical " version , it still looks like a bootleg ! sad.. . it is of some significance that this " review " is the first time i 've chosen to speak out about something in fusion that was less than flattering . it should also be noted that my disappointment is aimed directly at cbs / sony / bmg and not the musicians / producers . i 'm still amazed that this record company can see fit to release this and hold back the already remastered mahavishnu orchestra live in cleveland cd that was supposed to be released in 2004. lastly , let me make it perfectly clear that zawinul , shorter , and beldon are musicians and people i personally hold in the highest esteem with zawinul and shorter being musical divinities as far as i 'm concerned . while my review is an obvious personal venting , and i realize that zawinul and shorter gave this project their stamp of approval , i think that should n't be mistaken for a personal attack . my remarks are simply observations with some attitude directed at cbs / sony / bmg . by rick calic jazz rock world

dvd pos 844.txt of course dead alive was the better movie . but i think the comparisons to the peter jackson masterpiece are appropriate , due to the fact that there is a high body count , lots of over-the-top splattery deaths , and annoying partygoers that end up as zombie killers , some as zombie lunch . apparently there was some footage cut out for this release . i 'm not sure if that was gore footage or not , but i would think gorehounds would like this one due to the overwhelming amount of onscreen violence . there is even some non-gore & quot ; grossout&quot ; humor ( vomit-related , etc. ) that reminded me of bad taste as well as dead alive . sorry to run the peter jackson comparison into the ground , but again the influence is unquestionable . do n't expect the fx quality of dead alive though , this looked lower budget and some scenes were a little too dark to make out everything clearly . i do n't know if this was the way the original film was shot or if it was the print / transfer , but it 's a minor distraction . they did a great job with a relatively small budget . i echo the other reviewers who would like to see ittenbach 's other films on us ( hopefully uncut ) dvd release- -i 've heard burning moon is especially crazy

" but , over the past two decades , i 've seen this film a number of times and now have a decidedly higher opinion of it . la belle et la bete is a seriously important movie and a groundbreaking entry into the world of cinema . it 's certainly cocteau 's masterpiece . without a doubt , it provided the direct inspiration for disney 's oscar-nominated version , as well as greatly influencing cbs 's 1987 beauty and the beast television series . jean cocteau took madame leprince de beaumont 's classic story , adapted it , and put his own stamp on it . cocteau 's artistic vision is dazzling to behold . the viewer is treated to a delectable visual feast replete with disturbingly aware statues , ghostly arms jutting out of walls to clutch candles , vocal household objects , jewelry which turns to rubbish , etc. but nicely juxtaposed with the imaginative , surrealistic trappings are the more mundane sequences revolving around belle 's family , which serve to somewhat ground the fairy tale to a more reality-based semblance . this atmospheric film was given an enormous lift by the very wonderful performances of the two leads , josette day and jean marais . josette day , as belle , her most luminous role , personified beauty , grace , and class . jean marais , on the other hand , made women and young girls swoon in his dual roles as the handsome scoundrel avenant and the tortured but gentle-hearted beast . in fact , marais portrayed the fearsome beast in such a sympathetic and romantic light that , in the end , when the hirsute and awful monster was transformed into the handsome prince , cocteau and marais actually received many letters of complaint . the women much preferred their kindly beast . ************************************************************ the criterion collection 's high-definition , crystal clear digital transfer is awesome to experience , lending a lushness and clarity that was lacking in the older , grainier copies . this film is also well-stocked with special features : - 2 audio commentaries - a philip glass opera soundtrack option - " screening at the majestic " - a 1995 documentary featuring interviews with the cast and crew - interview with the film 's director of photography henri alekan - " secret professionels : tete a tete " ( professional secrets : face to face ) - the title of a french television show , of which particular 1965 episode showcases makeup artist hagop arakelian , who worked on la belle et la bete - the original trailer - the restoration trailer - film restoration segment - stills gallery - a booklet which includes jean cocteau 's notes on the film and a reprinted translation of madame leprince de beaumont 's original fable .

dvd pos 123.txt the brood is the lightning in the bottle that director david cronenberg has never been able to duplicate . while all of his films definitely have his fingerprints all over them , the brood managed to rise to the top of all of his films . it is absolutely dripping in a sense of dispair and dread . there is a pervading coldness about it - such that you want to wrap up in something warm as you watch it - you want to watch it with the lights on because you 're very much afraid of what might be there if you turn off the lights . the film is a psychological thriller wrapped in a slasher flick . it warrants slasher status simply because of the sheer number of onscreen murders that take place . this is a very bloody film ! samantha eggar is nuts and in a weird clinic for people like her . she is being treated by a creepy oliver reed ( in one of his better performances ) . art hindle is her ex husband and he 's worried about how she is treating their young daughter . after a while that is the least of his worries , as these horribly disfigured and ( what the hell are they ? ) bizarre little children run around killing all the people that have really ticked off samantha eggar . i wo n't say more , because part of the horror in a cronenberg film is the pseudo-science that he get you to believe in . whereas cronenberg 's videodrome was weird , but not terribly good , the brood is one of the creepiest films i 've ever seen and a guilty pleasure ( can i really call it that ? ) that i choose to subject myself to every so often . really ! what are those things ?

dvd pos 769.txt robert ryan made a number of westerns during the 1950s and ' 60s , but always he seemed to be overshadowed by other actors in the genre . nevertheless , who can forget the wild bunch or his magnificent portrayal of " old man clanton " in the seriously underrated hour of the gun ( with james garner ) . and his self-effacing determination is equally unforgettable in the day of the outlaw . now one of his best roles , as the straight-arrow sheriff in the proud ones is on dvd and available at a very reasonable price . finally . the proud ones is perhaps director robert webb 's finest picture , combining great action scenes and plot twists , taught dialogue , and a superior cast that includes not only ryan , but jeffrey hunter , walter brennan , virginia mayo , and robert middleton . minor roles are given attention as well , especially arthur o'connell ( as ryan 's deputy ) and , important thematically , the wonderful paul burns , who plays the town drunk and panhandler....hunter , when he finally assumes the mantle of sheriff , will give alms to burns at the finish of the movie , just as ryan did at the beginning , when he was sheriff . this touch dramatically completes the movie and has much to say about hunter 's increased maturity . the proud ones is a superb movie , with a great story...it will repay re-viewing . unlike some westerns , i do n't tire of watching it periodically . it is that good.. .

dvd pos 499.txt director : denzel washington cast : denzel washington , derek luke , joy bryant , salli richardson , malcolm david kelley , cody hodges , leonard earl howze , novella nelson . running time : 120 minutes rated pg-13 for violence , language and mature thematic material involving child abuse . based on a true story , and with a screenplay written by the eponymous hero from his own book , " antwone fisher " is at heart a study of psychological disturbance , laced with reasonable amounts of hollywood sugar and optimism about the human spirit . it 's a peculiarly american medicine , swallowed less willingly in some markets than others , which probably explains why criticism of the film often confused denzel washington 's directorial talents ( which are generally good ) with the various workings of his film 's plot , which can be argued about . antwone fisher 's story starts in the navy , where after a particularly vivid nightmare he slugs a fellow shipmate , and is hauled up before the captain . sent to navy psychiatrist jerome davenport ( washington ) , he begins to work out issues of anger that , it turns out , stem from an abused childhood to which is added a guilt complex over a dead friend . at the same time fisher ( played exceptionally well by newcomer derek luke ) , struggles to establish a first adult romantic relationship with the inviting cheryl ( joy bryant ) . in a parallel plot thread , washington 's character , the ever-reasonable dr. davenport , is having marital problems . in due course we discover that he has things to learn about communicating too and fisher is a catalyst for his own change . fisher 's screenplay reached the cameras by a somewhat circuitous route : after his stint in the navy and with little writing experience , he was hired by a sony executive to write his own story - a process which apparently underwent over 40 drafts before it was acceptable . most of the weaknesses of the film can be traced to the uncertainties he brings to his new craft , although washington 's direction papers reasonably well over many cracks . the most unconvincing elements are those subplots that revolve around the main character . these include the psychiatrist 's ironic domestic problems , as well as fisher 's tentative love life . one is tempted to see these narrative distractions as rather manipulative bolt-on elements , leavening the appeal of a central , harrowing , personal history . the fisher - cheryl romance for instance , while in context necessarily clumsy , is also ultimately gauche . and once consummated , it is left to languish without further comment , as if further exploration of this side to fisher 's maturing was unnecessary . perhaps sensing this central weakness , fisher 's script introduces another element into the young african-american 's tortured life as a foster child . during flashbacks he has to deal with ' slave-nation ' justifications from mrs. tate ( novella nelson ) , suggesting a link between the hurt done to the individual and that presumably done to the whole black race - a reasoning which is frankly unconvincing and none too interesting . significantly , such issues are given short shrift by the psychiatrist himself , and soon disappear from view . on the plus side is the central performance by derek luke as the hero , a perfectly judged acting job , that neatly balances inner rage and confusion - " i do n't know what to do " - with lack of self-pity . washington 's role is also well done . given the difficulty of the actor-director role , he is to be applauded for carrying off both so effectively and without fuss , either in front or behind the camera . this is washington 's directorial debut and he does an admirable job of painting a thorough picture of antwone and even though the film could have benefited from some tighter editing , it 's still a film that delivers all the emotional goods . arguably the most impressive thing about this film is the casting of luke who was a total unknown actor with a mere handful of television credits to his resume and obviously washington knew he possessed the right goods to pull off the role . despite its flaws , " antwone fisher " is an intriguing look into the real life of an estranged , enigmatic individual ; it is a film that will stimulate the heart and make you wish that small children did n't have to endure such horrors .

dvd pos 630.txt one of the most compelling events of the release of kenneth lonergan 's you can count on me is that it gave visibility to mark ruffalo who plays a troubled young man who , unable to deal with the childhood trauma of having lost his parents to a car crash , lives of life of unattached agony and isolation . he 's a loner and a drifter , medicating his self-pity with pot and short-lived relationships . his sister sammy , played wonderfully by laura linney , reacts to the same tragedy by being , in many ways , an overresponsible overcontrolling super mom . two opposite reactions to the same tragedy of course result in a sibling clash . this film shows with great complexity and biting comic insight , the attempt of this brother and sister to shed their defense mechanisms and most importantly reconnect with one another . the ride is never easy in this film . no easy answers are given . just as important , this film , which deals with the pain of loss , never descends into the maudlin hallmark movie sap that other films would . balancing edgy humor and profound psychological insight , lonergan has written and directed a tale that captures the layers upon layers of psychological complexity that accompany the trauma of loss . amazingly , he does it in a fast-paced film with scenes that are by turns comic and dramatic . matthew broderick , for example , plays a hilarious role of sammy 's neurotic anal-retentive boss at the bank . the conflict between him and sammy leads to a plot point that i 'll let you discover in the film . but most of all , this film shines because mark ruffalo plays such an endearing , sympathetic , sometimes infuriating character . you wo n't forget him

books pos 339.txt i 've skimmed a number of popular books published in the last few years on the problem of sexless marriage , and this is by far most interesting contribution to date . first , there is no recommendations for drug therapy anywhere in the book . second , the author frequently brings into the discussion a european-influenced view of some particularly american style predilictions and assumptions reguarding sex , parenthood , gender politics , and relationship expectations . her fundamental premise is that eroticisim requires seprateness , and in the course of building and sustaining security , we can frequently lose the " me " and " you " in us . but even more important , she sees the very contemporary marital impulse toward an egalitarian union - - while great for chores and child care - - can be a neutralizer in the bedroom . you may or may not find strands of your own dilemma in her case histories , but you will not walk away from them empty handed , either . there are many aspects of the book which are highly nuanced , and wo n't survive well in the o'reilly world of broadcast media interviews . i can just hear some producer-fed talking head asking something like , " you advocate couples go to vegas for swinging ? why ? " ( she does n't ) . so do n't pay attention to that noise . this is an intellegent , respectful , contemplative work of original thinking that confronts a subject too often approached with superlatives and pabulum . buy one for yourself and one for your best friend - - more than likely , they 're suffering , too

dvd neg 873.txt i do n't know what the last poster was thinking.. . this dvd goes to the top of my worst quality list . i would n't complain as much but they are advertized as & quot ; digitally remastered , & quot ; which is obviously meaningless . & quot ; long john silver&quot ; is soft-focus , borderline blurry , throughout ; marred with constant flecks and blobs ; and has countless vertical scratches that score the full image . it 's like watching some old home movie you found in a trunk . have n't viewed & quot ; captain kidd , & quot ; but a cursory scan indicated it too is in poor condition . if that 's the best the films come , and there 's no money for clean-up , so be it . but get that misleading & quot ; digitally remastered&quot ; off the box . that 's a hoodwink if ever there was one

software pos 64.txt i downloaded the demo of this program and although i am by no means a pro photographer i do have over 4 , 000 digital photographs of my family and i am taking new photos each day . in addition i post my photos on pbase so family and friends can always see the latest photos . i started looking into digital asset management after i started to fall behind on updates of the pbase photo website because of the time consuming process of managing my collection . in case you have not looked , there are products out there such as idimager , imatch , extensis porfolio , and many more . i downloaded demos of imatch and iview media pro and used each only briefly . although imatch costs only $49.00 or so and iview costs about 3x more ( around $160 ) i chose iview because i felt the interface was just easier to use . of course this says nothing about the features in each product and i am not attempting a feature by feature comparison because i do n't have the time . i do think that imatch is an excellent product and the few features i am looking for appeared to be available in both products . i recommend that anyone looking to purchase software attempt to download a demo first

camera pos 989.txt i 've been waiting for this technology for years . so when i found out jvc was planning on coming out with their 4 gb microdrive version , i had to have one . the $1500 price tag was too much though . then i found out the gz-mg50 was coming out , and would be about a $1000. i thought it was still a little pricey , but i could n't wait any longer . so far , the camera has performed great . it 's been easy to use and easy to transfer the files to my computer then to dvd . however , the video editing software that came with it seems a bit cheap , but it gets the job done . maybe the next gen version will be an improvement . the movie quality is very good . i wo n't give it a " great " because i occasionally see pixel blurring when watching my burned dvds . do n't bother taking pictures with this , unless you only plan on emailing them . the quality is far too low to use to capture those precious moments . i recommend getting an additional battery ( the three hour model ) . the one hour battery just does n't cut it , especially if you want to review your scenes while you 're out shooting . if jvc gave the camcorder a larger ccd and included better software , i would have given this a 5 star rating , otherwise i think they are on the right track , and in a few years , the minidv may be as forgotten as the eight-track .
dvd neg 347.txt it 's good to see that in his twilight years , old squinty eyes , clint eastwood is growing comfortable playing grouchy old dudes , because , well , he is a grouchy old dude . this movie is anemic from the beginning . taken from a wonderful novel by michael connelly , clint plays an old grouchy dude who 's just gotten a new ticker because his last one gave out while chasing a serial killer . run , run , run , thud . next , new ticker intact , clint is hired to find the murderer of a cute black woman by her sister , another cute black woman . oh , and cbw#2 plays the guilt card on clint , because he 's got his new ticker courtesy of cbw#1. so there 's a little bit of investigative work , a little but of huffin ' and a puffin ' , and finally clint discovers who the serial killer is who was responsible for his first ticker giving out and the murder of the donor of his second ticker . jeff daniels plays a doofus that lives next door to clint . what a stretch . special warning : clint takes off his shirt yet again in this film as he smooches on cbw#2. it must be in his contract or something . no one , and i mean , no one wants to see saggy clint with his shirt off . for a much , much better clint movie , go rent " unforgiven "
software neg 254.txt i trusted that this software would do what it claimed to do and was so let down by its lack of performance that i am dumbfounded and left speechless . during backup process i selected about 15gb of info to backup , spanning 4 dvds . everything looked fine , except for two ( 2 ) simple errors that i received , indicating that those related files may not have been copied / backed up properly . i figured no big deal , 2 files / errors out 15gb , i could handle that . based upon the false pretenses that my critical info was backed up properly ( simple pictures , videos , mp3 files and financial files to include previous years tax files ) , i then proceeded to slick my drive . remember , only 2 simple , benign and almost inconspicuous errors during the backup process . everything looked great . during the restore process , i then received numerous errors , each of them requiring me to click ' yes ' when asked if i wanted to proceed . i got tired of clicking yes around the 100 or so mark and decided to click no . when you click ' no ' , everything is undone ; there is no ' ignore all ' function so i had to sit through every prompt and got tired of it and decided that proceeding with 1000 files and answering yes would involve too much pain for me . i then selected a smaller group of files to have restored , only the ' my documents ' folder but ran into the same situation . eventually i ran a test on a small folder to have restored and still ran into the errors but pressed through . hardly any of the files were received error free and those that had issues were never restored . my guess is approximately 2 / 3 or 3 / 4 of my files were not restored and of course none that really mattered made it . i had the latest update applied to the program , so that should not be the cause . i would have done better to slick my entire hard drive without going through the backup process as i would have been at nearly the same place but without experiencing all the headaches , frustrations and an investment of hours , no days of my time . the program has been recently purchased by microsoft for inclusion in the vista os , i imagine . it will do well as a microsoft product , as it fails to deliver upon its promises

books neg 784.txt although i am a psych student with a pretty good gpa , i find this book difficult to understand . the difficulty seems to come from the authors ' desire to condense as much information as possible in just a few hundred pages . this leads to a cryptic language , where some terms are defined only once and some sentences become a string of such words , a thing which , personally , frustrated me
dvd neg 290.txt the only good thing in this movie was ms. howard 's performance , she is innocent and believable . i ca n't understand how good actors like weaver , hurt , and phoenix would let themselves be wasted on this . the ' plain ' dialogue among the ' elders ' is painfully numbing , choppy , and stilted . and the directing drove me crazy , especially since m. night...insists on filming group scenes as is he was just passing through , or following them without ever bothering with close-ups . these scenes make me feel like they were done by an amateur filmmaker with a his first video camera . if you like the back of william hurt 's head , you 'll get plenty of it in this film , the camera seems to avoid his face like the plague ; which is too bad , since when he finally has a good speech , we are deprived of the anger i imagine was in his eyes . i agree with others , i would have worked better as a 30 minute twilight zone episode . rent it first before you buy , and save some money for a classic thriller , like psycho

books neg 848.txt melrose larry green 's book is full of quotes . quotes and information used to back up points are good things . he appears to have researched by surfing the internet , watching television and legally incorporating the opinions of others . this is all fine and acceptable . the problem with " why the clintons belong in prison " is when the author ( cut and paste expert ) attempts his own narrative , which is sporadic , jumpy and poorly edited . his points are not linear , and show the author 's attention deficit . with a proper literary team , this book could have been something of note but unfortunately it feels like a " hit and run " report and reads like a one-sided sensationalized talk radio program .

software pos 224.txt this is a good package for backing up your pc . fairly intuitive , although it took me a couple tries to figure out what the software was doing so i could select the right stuff to backup . it uses good compression to minimize the amount of disk for your backup . the downside of that is you ca n't just select a file to restore , you must go through the restore process . you can select a single file , but it takes a bit of time . runs automatically and unobtrusively so it wo n't interfere with your current work .

books neg 610.txt the novel , a northern light , by jennifer donnelly , is a very realistic portrayal of the life of a teenage farm girl , bound for a great future . jennifer donnelly relates to mattie gokey , the lead character , in a way that they bother grew up in rural side of new york . donnelly attended the university of rochester before she wrote her three novels and one children 's book . her novels include , the tea rose , the winter rose , a northern light , and a children 's book , humble pie . all of her novels include a very popular romantic theme and her book , a northern light , has also been introduced in europe under the title a gathering light . a northern light reflects a lot on the issues of wealth , education , love , and murder . the combination of those themes makes for a novel that anyone is able to read and relate to . as you read this book , you feel like the main message is the traditional cliché of following your dreams no matter how hard they are to achieve . but as you read further , you realize that it 's a lot about hardships , strength and love . on the first page of the book , mattie is imagining a perfect day at the glenmore hotel before she so disappointingly tells herself , " i believe these things . with all my heart . for i am good at telling myself lies " . from this quote , you can see the type of person mattie is , and it gives a foreshadowing to the events that would take place throughout the novel . the events typically consist of let down after let down for mattie and her hopes for her future . this book is written from mattie 's point of view which really helps the reader to get to know her better . it adds a different element to the book that would n't be there if it was n't written from mattie 's point of view . it lets you get inside mattie 's head and feel the emotions that she 's dealing with along with her true thoughts and feeling towards situations . mattie is truly troubled girl who works so hard toward what she wants and yet there is always something holding her back . she 's stuck in a farming town where education is n't as important as having a prosperous farm and a family . as you read this book , you just want to tell mattie that she needs to take her own future into consideration and stop worrying long enough to have some faith . she is a selfless giver who is willing to do anything and everything to keep her family and her farm doing well . she deals with extreme guilt for wanting to leave her father after her mother died . she has to learn that the promise that she made to her mother to always take care of her family includes taking care of herself as well . royal loomis enters mattie 's life at a very unconventional time when mattie 's unsure of what she wants to become and she has to chose between his love and the life she 's always wanted . mattie deals with her teacher , miss wilcox , leaving town . miss wilcox was mattie 's role model who was living the life of an independent poet with a car and a royal lifestyle . the life mattie wants . this book is intended for a female audience because it deals with issues that sometime only a girl could understand . it 's a fairly easy read so it is more for adolescents than adults but not for young children . the issues that it deals with are issues that children may not be able to appreciate as much as teenagers who are about to go to college and leave their families . a northern light is full of valuable lessons , but most of all it 's just a good book to get lost in .

dvd neg 772.txt the no-name comedians at the beginning were funny , bea arthur killed , and the dumpy lady at the end who kept talking about how african-americans used to dig her backside but do n't any longer was funny . courtney love 's antics were amusing but grew tiresome . the rest of the roast was horrible . telling tommy lee that his genitals are the envy of barnyard animals is not an insult . and , after it 's repeated ad nauseum , it 's not funny either . has andy dick ever been funny ? kimmel ? corolla ? sarah silverman ? spade post-farley ? no . it 's as if comedy central corralled the most unfunny comedians of the past 10 years . and the bonus features are horrible . the interviewer was annoying- -even the guests seemed annoyed with her . was gilbert gottfried not available ? that guy is funny
health pos 818.txt most reviewers on this site are unenthusiastic about this particular product . i think the main reason for that level of dissatisfaction is , as someone else suggested , that people need to pay attention to how , exactly , this trimmer works . because of its design , best results are obtained when it is inserted , withdrawn , then inserted again , and the procedure repeated . second tip : rinse the rotating blade , switched on , under the hot tap to remove accumulated hair , etc , after each use . it works better when clean . the main plus of this product is its size . yes , it is flimsy , made in china , and would probably sell for $2.50 if it did n't say panasonic on it - or come with a 12-month panasonic warranty . but it works very well if you use it right and keep it clean . i have had mine a couple of years and the only problem is that the blade is now dull and replacement blades are apparently not available

books neg 744.txt herf applies a very simplistic test to determine the nazification of both germanies : did they side with israel in the middle east version of the cold war or did they not ? the trial against paul merker in the east , which had as its background east germany 's reluctance to pay reparations to expropriated jews , serves as his prime evidence for the continuation of things nazi in the gdr . but both of these arguments completely ignore the marxist ideology underlieing the rationale of the east german leadership and bypass more complicated issues of political allegiance . moreover , they totally eclipse the east german cultural discourse on the holocaust , a discourse that was decades ahead of discussions in the west and still proves to be more sophisticated than most that is being written in western academia .

dvd neg 340.txt uhmm....yah.. . this is a low budget " film " , but low budget doesnt mean it has to suck . i 've seen tons of low budget films that were absolutely beautiful pieces of art . it 's impossible to even figure out where to start in reviewing sideline secrets ; for even untrained actors this is bad , it seemed that the voices were completely dubbed like in an old japanese movie , and i think i even saw someone moving in the background in the supposedly tense office scene when there was n't supposed to be someone in the backgroung . i will give whomever a tiny bit of credit though for turning a livingroom & a garage into what was supposed to be a club - and at the end of the home movie , i was pleasantly surprised to see the gogo dancer was actually attractive ( quite so too ! ) as opposed to the rest of the young cast in this trying ever-so-hard to be a soft-core porn\thriller . in all seriousness , this thing gave me a horrible migraine . if you are stupid enough to actually buy this ( thankfully my roommate rented it ) invest in either a bottle of advil or a sledge hammer - you 'll want to use both on your head after the first 20 mins.. .

dvd pos 21.txt the print looks like you 're watching it through muddy water ; is this something to do with the unclear " public domain " status of this and other of capra 's works ? does n't he have a family that could help out his dvds the way that chaplin 's family has done , or even , to use the opposite extreme , the family of edgar ulmer , who have released superlative versions of some pretty dicey movies ? the point is that if people are paying for something they deserve to get it served up nice , and all the various dvds of meet john doe are painful to watch . we 've heard for years of the re-worked ending of the film , and that another one exists ( or existed at one time ) . bring it on ! for now the pleasure is nearly entirely in watching gary cooper react to barbara stanwyck 's pure life . it 's sort of like ball of fire but a bit more subtle . moviemakers knew they were on to agood thing teaming the two , because cooper 's slow-moving , nearly snakelike screen presence got an injection of caffeine when placed next to stanwyck 's vibrant beauty and her gorgeous clear gaze and complexion . she does n't even have to speak , she emanates something very basic in her bones and her posture . okay , the movie writes itself into a corner , for what else is going to happen except that if gary cooper is not going to kill himself the movie will break the trust it 's established with the viewers . this has always been doe 's problem , that it has to cheat to come out ahead of itself , and it did n't work in 1943 and it still is n't working now . it 's great up until about an hour and fifteen minutes ; then you feel the gears start to whine and complain as " hollywood " tries to solve a basically philosophical dilemma

music pos 995.txt this is a glorious recording of one of the most lyrical , haunting scores ever composed for a film . each succeeding track is a treat for the ears , refreshing and invigorating . neeley and varese sarabande should be congratulated for recording and releasing this hirtherto neglected gem . in my opinion , though , the only part of the entire cd that does n't work is the beginning of the " waxworks " track - the score to this particular moment in the film ( when norma , watching herself onscreen , rises triumphantly to proclaim " i 'll be up there again , so help me ! " ) is one of the most powerful and recognizable images in filmdom . in the original , the music is strong , powerful and almost spine-tingling , but this moment on the cd is underwhelming and not fully realized . however , what is one misfire ( totalling all of eight bars , at most ) compared to the richness and texture of the rest of the recording ? ! in short , if you love film music , you most likely love the score to sunset boulevard - and if you love sunset boulevard , then you will most likely love this recording , too

dvd neg 85.txt there are certainly some memorable scenes in this film , but as a whole it just did n't quite work for me . vlastimil brodsky is indeed a talented and endearing actor but spends the whole film playing the same stock character : fanda , a maddening yet adorable grandpa , oh-so-young-at-heart , oh-so-mischievious and impish , but somehow oh-so-good-hearted and harmless that you ca n't help loving him warts and all . in fact , that 's one of the fatal flaws of this movie : the lack of any dark side to any of the characters . they 're all basically harmless walt disney types , even the bumbling and self-absorbed son . there are no real consequences to brodsky 's actions other than stella ( his wife ) finally talking divorce but it 's obvious almost as soon as the words are out of her mouth that she 'll come back to him . there is no center , no force or dynamic power in this film- --it 's like a limp wine that you tolerate because you do n't want to hurt the feelings of your host . the ending also relies on another lazy device , the virtual deux ex machina in the person of stella suddenly transforming into a spirited accomplice / supporter of fanda 's when she sees that his attempt at self-reform is only making him miserable . this film might 've been much more effective and poignant had it spent more time dealing with fanda 's desperate fear and avoidance of dealing with old age and death , instead of focusing on how clever , audacious and adorable of an elderly madcap he is , which makes much of the film reek not only of kitsch but even worse , narcissism . one wonders if the director was just so awestruck at the chance to work with mr. brodsky , who is a towering figure among czech actors , that he decided to turn the film into a bit of a hagiography of him . a more accurate title for this movie , especially given the ludicrous ending shot as the credits roll , might be : " the fantasy life of a poor old man .

books neg 835.txt do you feel different from people around you ? do they resent your ingenuity ? have you been kept from achieving your full potential by tradition-bound brutes who live only for base needs ? do you long for the company of others like yourself , who , tragically but inevitably , are biologically destined to wipe these shorter , darker subhumans from the face of the earth ? congratulations ! you are either in the aryan nations or the clan of the cave bear fan club , possibly both ! ( i exaggerate - you could be a nineteenth century english settler in australia , or a boer in south africa , or maybe you just like larry niven , but that 's beside the point ) i can forgive auel for the historical inaccuracies in the book . in the late 1970 's when she did her research , we did n't have the genomic tools to reconstruct the lives of neanderthals , and even now enough controversy persists to keep the discussion page lively over at wikipedia . ultimately we 'll never know for sure what the paleolithic was like , and auel 's is if nothing else a vivacious fictional suggestion . similarly , her bloated , almost puffy writing style is excusable in a first-time author , though one wonders what parasite infected her editor . i have n't read her more recent works , but i imagine she has probably improved . even with the pendulous sentences clan is not unreadable . what infuriates me is the casually racist subtext of the story , nowhere critiqued or even acknowledged . the story reads like a near-literal historicization of helena blavatsky 's secret doctrine on the fall of the " aryans " - who interbred with " subhumans " introducing the world to , oh i dunno , domination by the unworthy , blind tradition , suppression of the individual , all the hallmarks of the book 's neanderthal culture . of course , even in this the blond-haired blue-eyed ayla is innocent , overpowered by a brutish thug . against this master narrative , all the admittedly interesting side notes about plant-based medicine and flintknapping make no impression . i would recommend anyone interested in paleontology take a trip to a museum or cruise the internet , and give auel 's books a wide berth . also ? enough rape scenes already

dvd neg 270.txt here we have what has to be one of the most mind bogglingly boring movies ever made ! i could n't believe what i was watching ! moreover , i am aghast that this film garnered some acclaim and that some reviewers on these pages even saw fit to award this dreck with an unbelievable four and five star rating . what is going on ? is it me or them that has totally lost the plot of what movies are supposed to be all about ? am i naive to think that movies should first and foremost entertain ? where oh where was the entertainment in this lame effort of a film with its unsteady shaky comera work , hamfisted confusing screenplay lacking energy and inventiveness and the cloying performance of modern cinema 's most tedious and overrated sleep inducing actor ralph fiennes ? how i long for the good old days when we had great movies with great actors from great writers and great directors and which achieved what they set out to do - entertain.sadly with the emergence of such a travesty as " the constant gardener " it appears that we unfortunate " real " film lovers are in for a dismal viewing future .

books neg 76.txt just wanted to quickly say i have n't finished it yet , i am only on page 20 but already this book seems very overrated . the author dives straight in talking about going beyond the five senses to achieve spiritual consciousness , but this is nothing new and we are not even given any background on how the author developed his views . instead , he strides arrogantly forward as though he is the ultimate , conclusive authority on spirituality , and it 's very aloof and , actually , not an enlightened approach at all ! i 've just started the chapter on karma and it 's really starting to smell like just another mish mash of other people 's opinions clothed as quasi-originality . it looks like i 'm going to continue reading with a very cautious , vetting attitude toward the text . the fact that this was a bestseller only serves to show how genuinely interested people are to develop their spiritual consciousness - and how easily authors such as zukav can cash in on their hopes and fears . hey , that 's the material world for you !
books neg 39.txt first of all , i did not exactly ' read ' this biography . instead i purchased the cd version which i distilled via my car sound system every morning on my way to work ( i have enjoyed countless biographies of great american figures this way , and still been able to read many more technology related books ) . i had great expectations from this book , having recently enjoyed three biographies of lincoln . i have to confess that i was sorely disapointed . i found the research of mr mccullough to lack the kind of details that i have enjoyed in biographies from walter isaacson , richard carwardine , or doris goodwin . i do not seek a beautiful story in a biography , but rather a reliable source of facts that i can use to form my own opinion of a character . in this context , i find mr mccullough 's use of superlatives or long emotionally charged sentences to be a distraction from the subject matter of john adams and his contribution to america . i also enjoy direct quotes from letters , speaches , autobiographies , as they help me refine my impressions of the context ( the period , the relationships to contemporary characters , ... ) surounding a promonent figure . usage of the english language in politics has dramatically evolved since mr adams ' time , and i missed ' hearing ' the voice of john adams . instead , this biography felt like reading a translation where the personality of the translator overshadows the personality of the original author . finally , having read other biographies of the founding fathers , i was disapointed to find so little about the complex relationship between adams and franklin . all in all , my lasting impression is that mr mccullough did a great job at bringing john adams and the early american revolution to the masses through a very appealling product that may however leave readers asking for more historical details and less emotional opinions . had i known that , i might have passed on this biography and instead explore mr mccullough 's fictional work
camera neg 472.txt the manufacturer apparently states this case is compatible with the panasonic fz1 ( and by extension the fz3 which has an identical body ) . i bought it and can report that it is not compatible with the fz1. with just the lens cap on you have to jam it into the bag sideways and then wrestle with the camera to get it back out . if you prefer to use the camera with the lens hood adapter on the camera ca n't fit in the bag at all . there 's also no padding to speak of with this case . by comparison my lowe case for my canon eos elan provides a secure , padded repository and you can put the camera in lens down with the strap on top so the camera can easily be withdrawn again . targus makes decent laptop cases , but they have a great deal to learn about camera cases apparently . apparently it does fit some cameras , just not the panasonic fzs . considering the product is made in china one should be able to expect a bit more at this price
health neg 221.txt maybe it 's my own fault , but i did n't get that from the product description . it 's a weensy little thing for using on your desk at work or taking with you on business trips ; in my apartment it barely lasts through one night . it 's also really noisy . i am probably comparing to my last ( normal sized ) humidifier ( a vicks something or other , no longer available ) which was great and lasted 3 years , until hard water built up too much limescale.. . i would have cleaned more if i 'd have realized how hard it is to find one to replace it

dvd neg 829.txt a star is born is a disturbing film for all the wrong reasons . by failing to get the audience to sympathize with a movie star 's tragic downfall , the film displays a schizophrenic quality . there is almost a breakdown in the relationship between the audience and what happens on screen . this is in no part due to the performances by the lead actors ; it 's the nature of the material itself . perhaps if we were to see the james mason character as a likeable star before failure and booze drain away his ambition and reason for living , the audience would understand what the garland character sees in him and we could sympathize with both characters . instead , we see garland 's character despairing over a not very likeable washed-up drunk and we 're left feeling as empty as the film itself
camera pos 547.txt i purchased this camera as a replacement for canon optura 20 which was dropped and when estimate for repair exceeded price of this camera , i decided to move on . after using dcr-hc28 for several weeks , i believe this is a very neat package . overall , i am very satisfied with this camera . one of the first things that i noticed is that color representation in low light conditions is much more accurate than that of canon . i grew accustomed to adjusting optura 's white balance indoor in order to get accurate color tones . now i am finding , that automatic settings work just fine and , in fact , i did n't have a reason to play with presets as of yet . this camera is more of a " point and shoot " type than canon . it provides you with manual controls , but they are not easily accessible . still , i have not found a reason to mess with these . besides , for those , who would claim that manual settings are necessary for advanced / professional type of filming , i would point to the price tag and ask where and when did they last see an advanced / professional camera for under $300 ? this camera is also about half the size of canon and combined with low price and weight , produces a package that i can drag with me while going to the beach , bicycling , hiking , etc and not having to worry about ruining expensive piece of electronic gear , as was the case with my optura which , at the time when i bought it , cost me about 2.5 times of what i paid for sony . so far , i 've used this camera in about all of the lighting conditions that i would expect to ever having to consider . i have no complaints about its performance . picture seems to be sharply focused and color tones are correct . focus is fast enough to keep up with little kids or to shoot some sports / action . sound quality of the microphone is quiet acceptable . there seems to be very little noise from drive motor and it is not picked up by the mic so it is not transferred to your recording . all of the essential controls and menus are within easy reach . there are few negative points that prevent me from giving this camera 5-star rating . lack of any kind of accessory shoe or external microphone input is a drawback . it would be nice to have these , as it would increase range of conditions under which one can use it . still , among my friends , who actually have a camcorder , about 90% do n't own an accessory light or external microphone , so if it was possible to lower camera cost by omitting these features , it is not a criminal move on part of sony . the lcd display could have been a bit larger and it would not hurt if sony would provide it with more freedom of motion - it only swings out to 90 degree angle and in certain situations it is a limiting factor .
books pos 235.txt i would agree with the translator that imitation of christ ranks very close to the bible . i read it over and over . it is shocking clear and concise . it forces you to examine your conscience and admit that you are a sinner and encourages you not to be afraid to carry your cross and aim , yes , to be a saint . thomas a kempis 's words cut to the heart and ring true over and over . in the normal state of human depravity , deception , duplicity , relativism , and excuse-making no one could write such a book without a transcendant , almighty , omniscient , omnipresent and infinitely merciful lord . each chapter feeds the hungry and thirsty soul and feeds the fire to seek our lord more and more . i wait patiently for your return lord jesus for your judgement and the new heavan and earth

music neg 998.txt gonzalo is a fantastic pianist . this cd however is meant to capture his more thoughtful and sensitive side . however , it is languid and the tunes do n't stand out . it is hard to tell if track 2 is really track 4 as the plodding bass and minimalist approach on piano make for sleepy moments - if driving later in the day . i have heard him with fire and brimstone and sometimes it goes over the edge of taste . but it is exciting . not here . there is barely a hint of any cuban influence in this music as well . now some will like the gentleness i suppose , but with weak material and not much diversity , it sits pretty flat with me
books neg 976.txt i did a fast skimming through this book and noticed that for an essential monster movie guide , it certainly does n't praise or hype the genre that well . this book comes across like it was written by an elitist who 's too good for horror . nearly every movie / special gets a low rating and i ca n't understand why a book like this that could 've been a good companion to the horror fan would be so anti-horror as a whole . horror fans , in general , want to be be entertained and or scared...i for one do n't want logical stories and things that make sense if it detracts from the entertainment factor because typically what makes sense and uses logic in horror is boring . it gets 2 stars from me because it offers a diverse selection of films and includes mini biographies of horror legends like vincent price , christopher lee , peter cushing , lon chaney , boris karloff , etc. but for a horror movie book , the writers certainly did n't help their genre by bad-mouthing it so much in this book

software neg 676.txt this program works after it 's installed , but the installation process is unbelievably flawed . if you have a version of norton on your computer already , this may cause all kinds of problems with the new installation . not only did i have to uninstall all versions ( after norton lets you install the new one ) , but i had to make a bunch of changes to windows , also . on top of that , while you 're struggling to install ( i got it on to one computer easily , a second with some difficulty , and the third.. . well , it 's been several days of struggle ) , norton counts down the number of days in the subscription . so if you install on one computer today , and another two months later , then your subscription on all your machines still expires a year from now . i do n't see how symantec can put out a program that does n't allow you to upgrade easily.. . after all these years , they ca n't fix this major bug ? that 's just pathetic
camera neg 374.txt i read all the reviews and comments on this kodak printer i could find . many gave glowing reviews . i 'd just purchased a new kodak digital camera , and thought this printer dock would make a perfect setup . i was never able to get the printer to perform as kodak says it should . it caused some odd conflict , and my computer would not boot into windows xp with the printer attached to the computer . i ended up having to disconnect the printer , turn on my computer , and then reconnect the printer in order to use it . windows then had to always reinstall the printer drivers . it was made even more frustrating by kodak 's tech support . i called and emailed multiple times for assistance . in one conversation i was literally told " i do n't know what 's wrong and ca n't help you . " now that 's tech support ! finally the printer refused to print telling me that it was out of paper . i tried all kodak 's remedies , none worked . no matter how much or how little paper was in the machine , it said there was no paper . i even opened a fresh pack to find it still fussy and not let me print . i ca n't recommend this printer . i could give a better recommendation had kodak itself , through its tech support , at least have provided my with some competent assistance . i got about 2 dozen prints , quite a large cost for printer and supplies for a few prints before the machine just failed to work at all . about the only positive i can give is that the prints i did get looked good , the color was nice . i gave it an extra star for print quality alone . kodak was a name that had some strength behind the name once upon a time . it was synonymous with home photography once upon a time . they 've lost something over the years , and that is quality

music neg 774.txt while i doubt i 'll ever get used to the edited ( single ? ) version of ' nights in white satin ' presented here , i have to agree that the song selection in general is excellent for a compilation of this seminal band . that said , the moody blues ( or more likely , their record label ) have n't exactly been shy about releasing such anthologies and hits collections on cd , either . while ' gold ' represents an affordable means of buying some of the best known and loved music from the moody blues , it also is for me one of the most trying listening experiences as well . if i had to guess , i 'd say much of the music contained on ' gold ' comes from different masters than the songs currently found on other collections , and on the band 's original cd albums . there are definite issues with the sonic quality of these songs as presented on this disc . for instance , the music track of ' nights ' is horrendously compressed in comparison to earlier cd versions of this song ; perhaps the record label was working with an unremastered single release master of the song ( my guess ) , but the audible discrepancies between this version and earlier examples ( albeit , in the full album form including the late lament and the full orchestral intro ) are hard for this listener to stomach . i can point to any of the earlier music included here and say pretty much the same thing . whatever the reason , the original source material used for this cd could 've seriously benefitted from earnest remastering work . while i suspect that would 've raised the asking price of ' gold ' , i also would contend that great music deserves such caring treatment . as it is , too much of ' gold ' as issued is indeed quite tarnished , which in the real world given the metal that goes by periodic symbol of au would 've been impossible to do . but evidently in realm of the corporate music world , when selling music on the cheap and banging out sloppily compiled cds it 's very easy to take the most precious and thoroughly muck it up
health pos 286.txt this model was given to me as a gift almost two years ago . i bought another off of amazon because the recharge cord had a short in it , and i figured i could use a second one to keep in my travel bag . i 'd have to say i 'm pretty pleased with the trimmer . i like the fact that the guard slides up and down to the appropriate setting instead of me having to keep up with 4 or 5 individual plastic guards that have to be changed out when i want to change the trimming depth . i use it a few times a week , and it seems that it can go for months without needing a charge . the little vacuum that sucks the trimmings into the little holding area is not the strongest....it 's catches probably 70% of what i trim . you 'll want to be sure you 're standing over a sink or towel when using it . well worth the $30 i spent for this grooming tool
books pos 412.txt the novels in this series are not the escapist fantasies that many associate with the arthurian legends . they are , in fact , historical fiction at its best . whyte has gone to great lengths to not only ensure historical accuracy , but to weave the stories into historic events . the first six novels in the series ( that is all i have read , though it appears that there are two or three more ) give a wonderfully plausible explaination for the genesis of the arthurian legend . but the beauty of the books is in whyte 's prose . a scottish poet , he uses the language beautifully and creates characters so vivid and multidimensional that we forget the 1600 between their time and ours . these books will not insult your intelligence , and they prove that one does not need to suspend the laws of physics or distort the facts of history to find magic in the arthurian legend .

dvd neg 795.txt as i stated before , i have a fabulous thing called " digital cable " . one night i was flippin through the channels and this movie was on . i could only watch so much of it before i had to turn it off because the voice dubbing was way off . sometimes that happens with " digital cable " , but it usually it will right itself in the end . as i watched for about a half an hour i could not take it anymore . i tried everything to fix it including switching channels , turning on and off the tv , and things of that nature . i even went as far as calling comcast and complaining , but even that was a wasted effort . i eventually had to turn it off because i was a hairs-width away from haymakering morris . well , even though comcast ruined my viewing experience so far , when i was at blockbuster i decided to give it another chance . i know i mentioned that the lead actor could not act but i thought i could look past this , because it might not be completely his fault . for one the visuals could be slightly off like the voices , or it might be because it 's his first movie . who knows but howard 's mind was made up . " rumble in the bronx " was to be rented . from what i saw so far on " digital cable " , i possibly found a person i could call my mentor , when i enter the world of stuntmen . when i returned home i threw the dvd in the dvd player and guess what ? the dvd was messed up as well , the voice dubbing was totally off key as it was on " digital cable " . i raced back to blockbusters and returned it and grabbed another copy , telling them this dvd was broken . i returned home again and tried to watch it . " what the heck ! ? " i yelled , " is the world against howard tuttleman ! ? " you guessed it that dvd was messed up as too . i even tried it out on another dvd player and it proved to me that the run of dvds blockbuster has were all messed up . i got so frustrated that i threw the dvd out the window ( i rented it on my father 's card so there is no recourse to me ) . after i cooled down alittle bit by blasting away on my harmonica , i was still determined to see this movie . i ran up to best buy in troy , and i found a copy . i asked the servant that was working in the movie section if this is the most updated and newest version , hoping that it was a new pressing . i was happy with his answer and purchased it . well i returned home and made up some popcorn and grabbed a pop . i put the dvd in the dvd player and dimmed the lights . finally , tuttleman will have his moment . well to keep this clean and short , let me say that , that night ended with a baseball bat , three ( 3 ) stitches in my hand , a broken window , and a hefty grounding-sentence ( we are talking weeks here ) . in conclusion , some movies ca n't be good , no matter how cool the stuntman , this movie should be pulled off the shelves because it could possibly start a riot . later .

dvd pos 44.txt a film that 's a little like trying to find your way out of a house of mirrors or an attempt to reassemble an image once it has been split by a prism . since nothing is as it seems , we may as well be inside a fictionalized world ; like the unicorn story the main character , cathryn , is writing . this fantasy is read aloud throughout the film creating a framework whose only relevance to the story unfolding , is to reassure us that we have stepped into a world that is a creation of the imagination ; however , the fact that is comes from the mind of a schizophrenic is hardly reassuring . a glance at the cast of characters hints that they are not necessarily who or what they seem ( hugh is played by rene , rene is played by marcel who is played by hugh . cathryn is played by susannah and susannah plays cathryn ) . insanity is not an ordering principle of the mind , but rather a vain attempt to put order to an ever-changing palette of images that may or may not be reflections of images within the mind instead of outside . a very atmospheric film made more so by the disturbing score that is not altogether in sync with the action , another technique that constantly keeps the viewer off balance

dvd pos 391.txt for a plot synopsis please read the amazon review . i wish to talk about the reasons why you will love this film . as a longtime fan of both sam raimi ( of the evil dead series ) and bill paxton ( aliens , twister ) , i went to see this on opening night . not many people can claim this i 'm sure because it was and is , such a small film that received next to no marketing . for shame . this film is in the best tradition of modern film noir including blood simple and fargo , both made by the cohen brothers . film buffs will be able to draw the connections to those films and their filmakers , so i wo n't bother to get into that . should you have seen either of these films and enjoyed them , i suggest you stop reading and immediately rent a simple plan . if not , keep reading and i will try to express why this film is so remarkably brilliant . and why i hope you will take a look at it . a simple plan is , at its core , about four people . and underneath all the plot devices and twists , it 's about how they relate to one another . notice i did't say characters , because this film does n't have actors simply delivering dialogue . it 's about people you get to know , understand and sympathise with as they undergo the most brutal of dilemmas . sure , finding a mysterious bag filled with money is an excellent plot device , but the heart of this film is much simpler than that . it 's about the basic human flaw of committing a criminal act and trying to weasel your way out of it . and being forced to do the most unthinkable things in the process . that 's what gives this film such depth . you watch these people try to figure out how to cover every angle so they can get away with stealing a whole lot of cash . and in the end it falls apart for two reasons : the details and the human factor . they say the devil is in the details and this is never truer than with a crime . as for the human factor , where greed is concerned , people cannot trust one another because they fear the other person 's greed while are unable satisfy their own . in many respects this film is almost an homage to blood simple and fargo , but in many ways i think it is superior . i often draw the comparison by a scene which is both a simple plan and blood simple where a body is increasingly difficult to dispose of . and even afterwards , after the emotional toll the has been taken , once one evil act is committed , another is sure to follow . it 's so painfully facsinating to watch a person work out their problem on camera , frantically going over the details in their mind , all the while their heart is beating a mile a minute . bill paxton does this better than anyone . he is such a likable man ( both in the film and in life ) that you ca n't help but feel sorry for the mess he has created . his entire performance is a balancing act between getting away with a seemingly harmless crime , keeping his partners at bay and their mouths shut while being prodded along by his conspirator wife . that may make them all sound malicious , but really the opposite is actually true . they 're all normal folks , like we 've all seen a hundred times . and in the end it really gets to you because you can imagine how you would react in the same situations they find themselves in . after all , were you faced with the choice to steal a couple million dollars that no one would miss , what would you do ? but then again , nothing is ever that simple

camera pos 446.txt we had a canon powershot s50 3 years ago , loved it . so this time when my husband wanted to buy another digital compact camera , we specifically looked for canons . we originally were thinking of getting the sd700 , 800 or something like that . but after we compared these cameras together in a store near us . we found out sd900 has the finest lcd display , more opitions in control panel.. . so we came back and bought it from amazon ( our favorite online store ) . we used it in our last trip to grand cayon , lv , sf etc. this sd900 takes very good pictures , especially in good lighting conditions . colors are also smooth and rich . the downside , as you may already read from others ' reviews , no battery indication , no raw ( it 's ok , my husband does n't do much editiing anyway , it will be too much to ask for a campact camera to offer ) , control panel is sensitive.. . do n't get frustrated if you happened to pressed the wrong button and could n't figure the way out during the time of shooting . stich is a great function which comes with , but when in a very bright area , you can not see the stich alignment very well on the lcd screen ( i guess it 's a common trouble to all digital compact cameras which are relay on lcd dispay ) . overall , it 's a wonderful camera , we love it . it 's my husband 's camera , i uses canon 350d , but i borrow it from my husband sometimes because it 's tiny compares to my 10 lbs " moose " and it takes very good pictures .

software neg 552.txt " genius " is an educational simulation game , where you 're building an industrial complex - - plop down factories , roads , houses , fire departments and such . as the game progresses , you complete physics puzzles to obtain new technologies and product improvements . you subscribe to newspapers , which contain answers to some questions and the knowledge or equations needed to solve others . the physics problems are entertaining , well designed , well documented , implemented excellently , and can be quite fun . they are presented as problems you encounter during business operation , for example while developing a new product . all of the information you need is provided . the game will appeal to children 8 & up , but these physics problems are more like age 16 & up because they require high school math . so , children & youths may need help from a parent who remembers algebra and preferably physics - - yikes ! some of the questions are easy & fun . some require you to be comfortable with algebra , converting between units , and applying formulae . a few are very difficult . fortunately , the questions are the same each time , so after figuring out the answers , you can write them down & just enter the answers next time . sometimes the game even gives you the correct answer after it is too late , so you can write it down for next time . unfortunately , i ca n't find a cheat sheet list of answers on the web - - too bad , this would really help . the level of difficulty of these questions is n't a problem , just be warned . the simulation side of the game is suffers in comparison . the industrial simulation controls are poorly documented . what each building does and when / why / where it is appropriate / inappropriate and how to run the game is somewhat of a mystery . there 's no way to figure out whether building something will be good or bad except trial and error - - logic does n't always help . bad decisions spiral out of control , seem to lead inevitably to bankruptcy . unfortunately , wrong answers on the physics problems can have the same effect . there is a " statistics " report that is supposed to give feedback on whether your company is making or loosing money , but this form does n't have enough information . so , expect some trial & error , some frustration , some algebra , some physics , & some reading through magazines looking for obscure clues . " genius " can be really fun , but could use some interface improvements . highly recommended for anyone taking physics in high school or college .
dvd pos 712.txt this is one of the great biopic films ever made . more often than not , film biopics are too rushed . they try and squeeze in every aspect of their subjects lives , and they end up giving short shrift to the person and their lives . this is not one of those films . it just covers woody guthrie 's adult life , from when he hit the road to when he became a big time folk singer , and his passionate defense of the working man . the look of the film is deliberate , in that it 's washed out . the hoedown scenes at the camp are some of the best in the film . they 're really lively , where the extras and everyone seem to be really enjoying themselves . the film has a real genuine feel to it , like you 're actually watching real people . david carradine is amazing as woody guthrie . he makes you think you 're actually watching woody himself . he did his own singing and stuntwork on the film . ronny cox is excellent as well , and he does his own singing too ( remember , cox played the man who jammed with the hillbilly in deliverance ) . randy quaid and melinda dillon offer great supporting roles as well . this is a fabulous film , and it feels short at 2 1 / 2 hours .
dvd neg 112.txt gene hackman is jedidiah tucker ward , an aging yet tireless litigant for the public good , enemy of evil corporate type and the bane of overpaid attorneys everywhere . on the other side of this gap of good and evil is maggie ward , jed 's headstrong daughter . between them is a products liability lawsuit involving car lights that kill people . the premise suggests the ending - jed will win the day , but not before his daughter has been transformed into a noble attorney . jed will fight the good fight ( which will require supreme grandstanding ) while maggie learns just how amoral her side really is . what robs this courtroom thriller is what 's missing in virtually every courtroom thriller - a case that could go either way , an actual case in controversy . maybe because of the amount of preemptive litigation required just to produce a major motion picture , hollywood is simply too beholden to lawyers to make a truly biting film about them . instead of a compelling case , we have one that 's ready for our verdict as soon as we 've seen the suits worn by either side or their offices . the case in " class action " is one you can typify as " david & goliath " , which is to say that the end has been fated to be won by the little guy by a higher power . there 's no way that we 're going to see a case won ( even by dishonest means ) by donald moffat 's hired band of harvard-trained professional liars , and there 's no way anybody in the audience is going to buy their arguments . maggie 's bosses are so transparently bad , that not only do they screw up , but even their explanations are patently evil even so , the film stacks the deck against them by cynically attributing to them as evil what are basic facts of life for lawsuits of this kind - namely that products liability plaintiffs will make overbroad requests for discovery , and defendants respond in kind by deluging the other side with documents responsive to the request but otherwise valueless . for a thriller about high-paid lawyers , " class action " has all the legal acumen of high-school mock-trial , with fewer suprises

camera pos 880.txt i am writing to offset some negative opinions on this unit . i bought the canon because it has facilities for an external mike . i am a new camcorder user and so have no practical experience to bias my opinion one way or another . first on the matter of tape drive noise : yes i can hear it if i put the unit up to my ear . but no noticeable noise comes up on actual movie clips when played back through my computer . second , they claim you can interconnect and capture clips to your computer . what they do n't tell you is that you need a firewire card and cable ( about $70.00 total at best buy ) . you cannot simply hook up through the available computer usb port . fortunately , microsoft provides the necessary drivers in the xp os and minimal capture software called " moviemaker " . i am not too pleased with the tape system but considering the price of the unit , i think it is a bargain . finally , i have become aware through short experience with the unit that the ergonometric design for the right hand was very well thought out . your thumb easily controls on / off and tape transport functions . it is really easy to use , at least for right handed users . all considered , i am satisfied with the product . of course , if it dies next week , i will have a different opinion

books pos 685.txt based on the description , i expected this to be a davinci code knock-off , but gave it a shot since i recieved a free copy . comparing labyrinth to the davinci code do it injustice ; this is definately not an imitator and is worth reading in it 's own right . i enjoyed the characters , plot , and switching between the past and present . i 'm not sure it has literary value ( i would n't argue that the davinci code does , either ) , but it 's certainly complex enough to make you think about the plot and character relationships without being difficult to follow
software neg 213.txt office 97 was a pretty good product . the programs were powerful , had a decent interface ( maybe not as good as the claris products of the early 1990s , but not bad ) , and came with a ton of features all on one disc . the office 98 release for mac was pretty much the same thing . the only thing that really got annoying for me was the office assistant ( paperclip ) but it is easy enough to turn off . office 2000 was a bit of a disappointment for me . i felt that the improvements were minimal ( aside from a bit more stability in word- -anyone who has ever used word 97 on a regular basis knows it 's prone to crashing ) and in fact detracted from the ease of use . one example is the clip gallery , which went from being one of the best organizers ever created to becoming a program that would n't have received decent reviews in 1988. another is powerpoint 's outline feature . i always turned this off because it ate up monitor space and therefore made the actual slide smaller . when you use smaller displays like i often do this is a problem . the menus , which hide some functions until you go to the bottom of them , were also an annoyance . the manual went from being a nice thick book to one half the size . office 2003 continues making the program uglier . now there are many tasks crammed onto one little panel on the right of the screen . again , this eats into the workspace . the clip art system is even more cumbersome , and many of the clips are online only now . the help feature tries to point too much in the online direction as well . now some people may not complain , but what if you 're using a laptop in the middle of the country ? i feel that the program is basically an uglier version of the same thing that was first seen in 1997. in fact , the 1997 version was more pleasant to work with and almost as powerful . on my macs , i 've switched to keynote for presentations and pages for some of my word processing because the new office versions on that platform are similar . some of the templates also look very 1997. apple 's programs are updated on a regular basis , and their templates look very modern . now i know microsoft adds some new ones now and then , but they should consider redesigning many of them- -such as replacing the overused arial and times new roman fonts with something a little more classy . the program is bloated way too heavily . i can run office 2000 comfortably on a 486 with sub-1gb hard drive , but ca n't even get 2003 on it . a final gripe is that access is not user friendly at all . file maker is a better alternative , as it is easier to use and friendlier

dvd neg 225.txt what a disappointment ! i absolutely loved the black pearl but was admittedly nervous about a sequel . as it turned out , i had every reason to be . it whole purpose of this movie seemed to be to return those characters from the original , major or minor , who seemed interesting . that they did but , unfortunately , the producers forget to give them a credible plot and interesting things to say . depp seemed to play his role even campier than before while keira must have , somehow , pissed off the writers so that they refused to give her any real meaty part of this movie . legolas , i mean , orlando bloom also seemed to be sort of drifting along , sometimes good but more often , haphazardly . to my mind , the only real interesting addition was that of davey jones . except for times when it was hard to understand what he was saying ( due to the tentacles ' n all ) , at least his was a unique addition to the movie . i do sort of object , however , to associating him with the flying dutchman legend . the two have nothing to do with each other , fantasy or not . and do n't get me started on the cannibals ! any way , i think this movie merits the two y'ars i gave it . while considerably beneath that first movie , it is somewhat watchable and even enjoyable at times , but it is most definitely not as good . and , as a final thought , the very last scene of the movie ? lose it entirely . it simply was unnecessary .

dvd neg 308.txt incredible does describe this movie - incredibly bad ! this movie does n't know what it wants to be . at times one can see attempts to recreate and milk the genuine rage and drama of " mississippi burning " or the anger and impunity of " ghosts of mississippi " , or a hybrid of those and bits and pieces of other movies of this genre . at other times it looks like its just trying to draw from the sex appeal and cheesy interaction of 2 of its main actors , matthew mcconaughey and sandra bullock . as a result this movie picks up the rear in that genre 's list of movies for lack of originality , and the scattered hodge podge statements it tries to make . some of my favorite actors are wasted , either by being given cliched dialogue , over acting , or being put there merely for their brand name with no script to support their presence . if this script is considered a great adaptation of a great book , then i have no interest in reading the book . i 'm sure the idea and the premise looked good on paper . but the direction does n't guide the story with any coherence or identity of its own . bullock is mere cheesecake and is unbelievable in her role , proving she 's only worthy of b-grade " miss congeniality " type crud . mcconaughey over acts so much ( as can be said for keifer sutherland and others ) that it can be said he balances out the under acting of patrick mcgoohan , kevin spacey and donald sutherland . samuel l . jackson should be ashamed of himself of not only his worst performance ever , but also easily his worst choice of movies to participate in . even the extras in this movie are horrible . enough ca n't be said about the terrible direction in this movie , equating elongated facial shots with drama to a fault , making sergio leone westerns look much more authentic by comparison . this is not " a powerful film . " it 's a powerful attempt at using a big name cast , a brand name book and a capable director to use material that they know would easily jerk the emotions of its audience , and in doing that they resort to all the cliches of this genre scattering the story line in so many directions , culminating in an over the top , pleading hunk of cheese summation scene by mcconaughey that would n't hold water in any real court of justice . maybe people claim greatness to this movie out of guilt , or because they have n't seen quality comparisons and classics like " mississippis burning , " that has both a great script and fabulous acting . i do n't know . all i know is it tugs from so many hokey directions it takes the final scene to remind everyone how it started . among the top of my most over rated movies
dvd neg 18.txt this movie has such wonderful reviews from both professional critics and amazon customers that i was expecting great things . while i agree the acting ( especially the girls playing christy and ariel ) is excellent the story is just too implausible and i got that impression from the minute we see the family crossing from canada to the us ( yes they are irish but for some reason they have to sneak in to the us from canada ) . anyway why on earth would an apparently intelligent couple enter the us with their two kids illegally , without jobs or much money to settle in the most expensive city in the country ? i know the dad is an actor but could n't he have settled the family in one of the less expensive boroughs and taken the subway in to manhattan ? the mom is a teacher but ca n't find a job but no wonder if they are in the country illegally . yet there is money for private school , fixing up the dump of an apartment , an expensive camcorder , betting the rent money on an et doll etc. i ca n't imagine any parents moving in to an apartment building known as the " drug house " with two young girls and then letting the girls wander about as they please . mind you the parents are a couple supposedly almost crippled by the guilt they feel over a third child - a son - that has recently died . i kept expecting someone to call social services . and the medical situations with both frankie and the mom and new baby are not well thought out or researched . the symbolism between mateo , the new baby and frankie is very heavy handed . though the film is told through the oldest daughter 's eyes because of several scenes and elements the movie is not suited at all to children . and there are also several scenes that are really not connected with the oldest daughter at all . maybe if i had taken it more as a fable i would have " gotten " this movie more but i was expecting a straight forward drama and was disappointed .

dvd neg 150.txt do n't expect a comedy in the vein of trinity or they call me trinity . if you do , you are in for a fall . both of those were silly but redeemed themselves by being entertaining . this one has no such pretensions . it is merely boring . the story concerns a corrupt mining company out to cheat the local town 's folk out of their claims . they do this through intimidation and violence . when a couple of friends get hold of a claim , they put together a plan to secure that claim and those of the rest of the town from the bad guys . to do this , they enlist the aide of a traveling circus to serve as a distraction . they yell , they fight , they wrestle , they shoot and then they do it some more . its not very exciting cinema . this production is made worse by the dvd . i suspect that the original film was a rather low budget affair . the dvd , however , is of such low quality that who could really tell ? the edges are clipped off , the transfer is grainy and the effect is of someone holding a hidden handycam in a theater trying to bootleg it . it was not worth the effort . spaghetti westerns can be fun . this one , however , needs the pepto bismol right from the beginning to drive off the heartburn .
dvd neg 631.txt the quiller memorandum takes place back during the cold war . it represented a time and place in history that was true at that time . it accurately depicts an era that is now gone , that some of us lived through . the movie , by today 's standards , is a little disjointed and incomplete.it jumps to a conclusion but lacks story development how it got there . some scenes must have been edited on the cutting room floor back in the 60 's or 70 's in order to get a g or gp rating . as a result of those incomplete or cut scenes , part of the movie makes no sense . the movie would have been better served if it were produced closer to the author 's original book . the most memorable part of the movie is the haunting score , including matt monroe 's " wednesday 's child " . i was disappointed in viewing this movie again some 20 or 30 years later . perhaps wolfe was right when he said that we can never go home again . quiller must have gotten lost on his way home !

books neg 75.txt i loved the earlier nevada barr mysteries , with their depiction of national parks and natural dangers . i was n't as happy with some of her latest efforts , but still had n't given up on her . now i 'm not so sure . this latest novel started off well enough although the idea of two severely traumatized girls should have been a clue as to what would follow . the idea that they were from a polygamous mormon sect was a red herring . perhaps it was barr 's attempt to show us how these girls were abused even before they met evil incarnate . the scenes where anna realizes who the real villian is and her interaction with him and the poor tortured third traumatized girl went on for over 60 pages . each scene was more disturbing the one before it . i found myself skimming the pages and still am not sure how she resolved all the loose ends . but i have absolutely no desire to re-read the end of the book and find out . i wish i could say that i would read another nevada barr novel because i so thoroughly enjoyed the first ones . but after reading this disturbing , somewhat convoluted story , i would think twice . if i did pick up another anna pigeon novel , i 'd make sure i had something else to read if the story took another dark turn . i would certainly not stick with it to the end .

books pos 291.txt while peter jay fernandez and jay o . sanders are n't the only actors to narrate the acclaimed cross series , they certainly are among the finest . with a host of television appearances to his credit ( law & order , cosby ) massachusetts born hernandez has also made his mark on broadway in jelly 's last jam and the merchant of venice . his voice has a tad of huskiness , which makes it all the more appealing as cross . in all , fernandez has been featured in almost 12 of the alex cross tales , so he well knows the characters and easily inhabits each scene . to date , jay o . sanders has narrated over 50 audio books , and he 's a perfect voice partner for fernandez . his experience includes off-broadway roles in shakespearean plays , which may account for his remarkably clear diction and easy listening tone . the voices of fernandez and sanders complement one another as they bring one of the most compelling cross stories to life . it 's a painful attention-getter when we listen again to how cross lost his beloved wife , maria - she was shot down before his eyes . her killer was never found ; the case chalked off as another sick drive-by shooting . now , cross has returned to being a psychologist , his children are thriving , and perhaps he may be able to love someone again . however , a telephone call from john sampson , his old partner , changes all that . sampson wants cross 's help in finding a psychopathic serial rapist on the loose in georgetown . of course , cross ca n't say no but little did he realize that this investigation would lead him to a tie-in to maria 's death some years ago . one more rapid paced thriller from the amazing pen of james patterson read by two consummate voice performers . - gail cook
software neg 164.txt im computer literate and regularly use a number of varying programs from visio to logic audio to ms office . after picking up illustrator however , im frustrated by the lack of intuition and steep learning curve the software offers . ive been told that the world revolves around 2 types of people : those who " get " vector graphic programs , and those who errrr...dont . unfortunately , after 10 hours use and much manual reading , i fall into the later category . i dont plan to give up however and plan to enroll in a course . this decision was supported by friends proficient in its use - but who had difficulty demonstrating the complex concepts to me . ( indeed , defining the direction of a drawn curve was as intuitive as metaphsyics or nuclear science ! ) so my advice is this : be extremely carefull if youve never used illustrator before . it may be a breeze to those well versed in its use , but to an absoloute beginner its an extremely difficult program to grasp and you may be dissapointed to find this out after youve forked out your hard earned dollars for it .

music neg 465.txt the restoration of a vivaldi opera must be a commendable effort specially if filling in big voids and rebuilding major missing parts of the masterpiece . motezuma is such an example where ample musical and artistic license was taken to bring it to life . like restoring a canvas where not only the colors and forms had faded but also sizeable parts were ripped off and lost , reconstructing motezuma presents the challenge for the restorer of thinking and dreaming , and becoming as inspired as vivaldi . in listening to motezuma , one can pick up the original vivaldian compositions from the reconstructed material as clear as looking at a combination painting part picasso part michelangelo . as much as such painting can be taxing to the eye , portions of this opera can be as disappointing to the ear . except for several arias and the two sinfonias , the music has a touch and taste of the 1800 's , but not of the baroque settecento . the juxtaposition of the restorative style is also distractive , and just does not work . it makes at times the orchestration devoid of the vivaldi unf , charm , and texture . nonetheless , motezuma 's musical beauty can be found in great arias such as d'ira e furor armato , la figlia lo sposo , gl'otraggi della sorte , d'ove la figlia ? , s'impugni la spada , and performances by vito priante , inga kalna , and marijana mijanovic . bravo for vito priante and his interpretation of gi'otraggi della sorte , and d'ove la figlia . he does a great ornamentation in the da capos , and turns up the volume in all the right notes . just like " terribile lo sento " , and " orribile lo scempio " , " gi'otraggi " shares the same musicalization . somehow , this version of the score is especially more dramatic and subtlely more melodic .

dvd pos 761.txt i 'm not sure why i never watched " ghost " before until last night . for some reason , i did n't pay much heed to it when it was first released and never thought it was worth watching on tv . i 'm glad i gave it a chance because this is a good movie . what makes it good is its ' skillful mixture of suspense , romance , comedy , and the supernatural . that would seem to be too much to tackle for one movie but we get it all in the right balance . i was drawn rather quickly into the movie and got to where i could n't wait to see what was coming next . there were a few " convenient " capabilities that these ghosts had that were necessary for the story to work . i 'm a rather pragmatic person but , by the time these things came up , i was so caught up in the story that i wanted these things to be possible . obviously , the writer and director deserve accolades for their work and the actors do as well . i wanted to make note of the quality of acting because it was probably the cast that left me uninterested in watching " ghost " . i was prepared to be unimpressed in particular with whoopie goldberg so i want to confess that i thought her best supporting actress oscar was well-deserved . i figure that i was one of the last persons in america to see " ghost " but if there are others of you out there who still have n't seen it , give it a look ; it 's well worth it

dvd pos 547.txt the economy , austerity and directness of the films of fritz lang made him one of the most profound , and precise filmmakers.. . lang , a master of the german expressionist film , shot his first talkie , a crime drama considered a landmark in the story of suspense movies.. . it was a shocking idea for its time , based on the real-life killer peter kurten , headlined as the vampire of düsseldorf.. . ' m ' is about a terrorized city , and a plump little man with wide eyes ( often chewing candy ) who is a pathological child-killer , unable to control his urge for killing.. . the film embodies several lang themes : the duality between justice and revenge , mob hysteria , the menacing anticipation of watching a helplessly trapped individual trying fruitlessly to escape as greater forces move inexorably in , and , for probably the first time in the cinema , it adds a new dimension to suspense : pity.. . for the killer is clearly mentally sick.. . he cannot overcome the overwhelming compulsion of his murderous disease , and yet , we see him hunted down and almost lynched as a criminal , rather than treated as a sick man.. . early in the film , the killer is heard whistling the grieg theme from ' in the hall of the mountain king' . this theme inexorably becomes imbued with menace.. . and when we see no more than a girl looking in a shop window , the melody on the sound-track told us chillingly that the murderer is there , just out of sight.. . the murderer is played by peter lorre in a virtuoso performance that has barely been matched in all the thrillers he has made since ' casablanca , ' ' the maltese falcon , ' and ' the mask of dimitrios . ' when the photographs of his victims , all little girls , are shown to him , he jumps back and twitches with horror.. . with powerful visuals , lang 's motion picture is lorre 's first film.. . his performance as the corpulent , hunted psychopath is a masterpiece of mime and suggestion.. . lorre is the archetypal outsider-outside the law and society because of his compulsive crimes , outside the balancing society of the underworld because he is not a professional criminal.. . he had only twelve lines of dialog.. . in the most famous of all about a pathological killer - alfred hitchcock 's ' psycho ' - anthony perkins lacked not only the threat of the tortured peter lorre , but also the dimension of invoking our incredulous sympathy.. . ' psycho ' reeked with blood and horror , whereas the suspense of ' m ' is subtle.. . a child 's balloon without an owner , a rolling ball , are enough to tell us that another murder had been committed.. . the audience , trapped in its seats , torn by ambivalent feelings towards the killer , watched him trapped as the net is pulled tight.. .

( 1 ) stromberg is a lame villain . yes , his underwater lair is well-designed , but it 's silly . not as silly as that ice palace in " die another day , " but pretty silly . ( 2 ) barbara bach is one of the very worst bond girls . she 's not an ugly woman , to be sure , but she was a terrible actress ; she sounds like she 's reading - - poorly - - from a cue card in ever single scene she 's in . ( 3 ) jaws is a stupid character . having metal teeth would n't actually make you capable of biting through metal . the metal you were biting would resist , and you 'd end up just tearing up your gums . i do n't expect realism from 007 movies , but i also expect them to not be outright idiotic . ( that said , jaws is effectively used , and richard kiel was excellent in the role . ) ( 4 ) the disco score is terrible . terrible . ( 5 ) the plot is nothing more than a rehash of " you only live twice , " but on the ocean rather than in space . certain elements of the big final shootout are even the same in both movies ! embarrassing . i love bond , but this is not one of the highlights . the dvd is good , with a couple of fine documentaries , but the commentary track grates , because the director and other commentators spend way too much time patting themselves on the back for the great job they supposedly did . even if that were true , it 'd be annoying
dvd pos 77.txt sorry , after reading some negative reviews i just had to speak up . this movie was one of the best movies i have ever seen . i still to this day watch it over and over again . well directed , some of the best acting i have seen , and my god the cast in this movie , the list of stars is endless . the courtroom scenes were so intense , i envey anyone who has not seen this yet . the story was perfect and so many surprises and turns . really well done . this movie is worth every penny , i just wish i would of got to see it in the movies . it is the most powerful movie i have ever seen , how can anyone say this movie was not good , i guess they just ca n't handle the truth. .

books neg 112.txt i had never read any of vernor vinges books before , but i had heard he was an excellent author , so i thought i would try this . boy , am i glad i bought it used on amazon for about only $4. i simply had no idea what was going on in this novel . the plot is unintelligible . i dont know what the bioweapon the jacket refers to is ? i dont know what " the rabbit " is . i see that numerous other reviews here , did not know what was going on either . i do not understand how someone could write so incoherently . the concept of someone who had alzheimers getting cured & entering a future society is great - but it never goes anywhere . the only reason i did not fall asleep , was that i was trying to figure out what was going on , but i did could not even finish this book
books neg 410.txt i enjoy reading books of trivia and fun facts , but i did n't even make it through the first chapter before i put this book down in disgust . almost every entry had to do with sex or male endowments . as i was flipping through the book , i found x-rated pictures and drawings that i would hate to have to explain to my children if they were to pick up this book . i never would have bought this book if i had seen it in a bookstore , and i regret throwing it in the trash before i could see if i could get my money back
dvd pos 396.txt i just wanted to say this is a great workout . i love the eastern dance styles . i have just written a long review of honey 's bollywood workout , and people were saying the same things , too fast etc...but indian dance is taught by imitation , and is very expressive facially and bodily ( especially the classical dances ) and open to improv . bollywood and bhangra are an extension of classical . most do n't realize eastern dance is learned and practiced in a vigorous manner imitating , learning , and memorizing from the beginning . the teachers of the classical and indian dances do not like to break up the steps and movement or slow them unless they are so , because you lose the inspiration and the feeling of whatever you may be portraying . so have fun with this , it 's awesome and leaves room for your own interpretation of things as mentioned . and it really wears you out . plus everyone looks great dancing and celebrating the movement and abilities of the body no matter the dance form ! but i find eastern to be the most passionate , feminine , beautiful , and divine . have fun
dvd pos 390.txt i 'll start out by saying that i prefer the jason movies . i think the whole body count is a fun way to watch a horror movie . the freddy movies are good horror movies , but they 're not really slashers like i thought they would be . - a nightmare on elm street - a great , classic horror movie by wes craven . he creates good high school characters , although trying to prove that they 're only 15 years old is a little far-fetched . freddy is more horrific and scary , he does n't say much . - a nightmare on elm street 2 : freddy 's revenge - they were asking for it when they completely changed the style and rules of freddy in this sequel . many will disagree , but i do n't think it 's a bad movie , it 's just very dark and horrific . - a nightmare on elm street 3 : dream warriors - definately a step up from part 2. it goes back to the roots of the original film and brings back nancy , who is now studying dreams and sleep in a mental hospital . the style brings us back to the original movie with the same rules and objectives . - a nightmare on elm street 4 : the dream master - decent entry in the series carrying over characters from #3 and introducing all new characters . the story does n't flow as easily this time around and it 's a step down from part 3 , but still good . - a nightmare on elm street 5 : the dream child - stephen hopkins ' visual style makes this the best sequel in the series . freddy is hilarious and the special effects are great . the story is more interesting than part 4 and the characters have matured since that movie which is good . - freddy 's dead - the final nightmare - cheesy storyline trying to tell us that in 10 years there will be no kids left in an american town ? rachel talalay thinks the 3-d effects in the film are lame , but not that story element ? if it were n't for the interesting backstory on freddy , this would n't be a good movie . - wes craven 's new nightare - wes craven did succeed in making an interesting and well made horror movie here , but it is a little strange to include it in the rest of the series . better watched on its own and not consecutively with the other movies . - nightmare encyclopedia - alot of interviews that are n't edited very interestingly make for a decent special features disk . it 's good to see that these interview are n't self serving at all and they 're completely retrospective , it would 've been nice to hear more from heather langenkamp , or possibly johnny depp ? this is a great set for extreme fans and a good set for casual fans . i 'm a huge fan of the alien series and a pretty big fan of the predator series , but not as much as alien . i would say that i 'm now a huge fan of jason and a good sized fan of freddy in comparison to alien / predator . i do recommend these movies , but this enormous box with annoying cardboard cases is outdated for today

music neg 206.txt anyone who rates this more than one star has mental deficiencies . seriously
music pos 252.txt like many amazon reviewers , i play a teensy bit of guitar . i know just enough to know how incredible these guys are . this is the best , most exciting acoustic playing i 've heard since al dimeola cut " race with devil on spanish highway " on his elegant gypsy suite lp . watching the del castillo brothers shred on the dvd part of this set will assure that i do n't get anywhere near my guitar for a long time . since robert rodriguez ( desperado , spy kids , etc ) filmed the performances , we get appallingly good , tight shots of the fretwork . people , it ca n't be done . i will henceforth concentrate on harmonica , and try to forget that sugar blue does about the same level of impossibility on that instrument . the songs and playing come from a somewhat traditional latin , mexicano perspective , but the overall sound is more like santana when carlos goes acoustic . the " hidden track " on the cd most overtly shows that the del castillo brothers love their blues and rock almost as much as the latin roots music . this is an obvious buy for anyone who enjoys latin music or great guitar work of any style , but it is more accurate to say that anyone who is not totally averse to this style should check it out . the quality of music here really transcends the genre

camera pos 626.txt i have a canon eos rebel which takes fantastic pictures . i use it around home and when i am setting up static shots such as family portraits . the only problem is...who wants to lug it around to take snapshots . despite some of the above opinions about lack of sharpness , i have had no such problems . the 5900 is great for " grab " shots and it 's not too shabby for setting up a planned shot using it 's advanced controls . be sure that you buy a fast memory card . this will reduce the time between shots . as in most cameras , a memory card is not supplied with the camera . mr. goyal 's review about not being able to take pictures without a memory card is not true . you can take a limited number of shots with the internal memeory . the only real problem i have is the red-eye reduction feature . i usually turn it off as the delay between the " red-eye " flash and the main flash is too long . the subjects often think the shot is over and start to move . anyway it is easy enough to remove it later , either with photo-software or with the photo kisok in the drug store

( and the camera gives you the impression you cant change shutter speed or anything ) however ! you can easily change this by going into the over / under exposure options and under exposing your photos when you are in dark environments . they come out surprisingly well and blur-free
books pos 568.txt i 'm writing this before reading the whole book but its a collection of articles so the different chapters are discrete units under a common theme of the economies of the arab world with a good deal on the economies of their oil producing gcc members . reading this book more than twenty years after it was published is fascinating as so many of the issues and repercussions mentioned have either come true or held true and the state of the region has not improved considerably but even regressed in many cases . consider the following excerpt from the book that i found interesting : " the oil states today face tremendous challenges , as oil revenues start to decline . few expected that the decline would come so soon . everybody knew it would come , but it was expected later rather than sooner . " this is almost like seeing history repeat itself in real time . worth a look if you 're interested in the field

books neg 588.txt this book devotes from 4 to 9 pages to every american president . each individual section includes a brief summary of the president 's successes and failures while in office . the " secrets lives " aspect includes a description of his temperament , character and personal habits . for example , john adams is said to have been vain and irritable , while frankin pierce is depicted as an alcoholic . also much oddball trivia is mentioned , such as that george washington had dentures made of hippo bone rather wood . the biographical information is at least somewhat educational , especially on the lesser known presidents such as millard fillmore and zachary taylor . but most people who study history will already known much of what is written here . the truth is that o'brien is not an actual presidential historian with scholarly credentials . but rather a freelance writer who apparently just read a few books , such as " the reader 's companion to the american presidency , " and then gathered together the bits he thought would be the most scandalous and entertaining . also o'brien provides no original research and some of what he reports as being factual is still subject to debate among scholars . however , what i found most disturbing about this book is o'brien 's tone and attitude . his so-called " humorous style " is basically a series of lame wisecracks and insults directed against the various presidents , especially those he dislikes . for example , he jokingly suggests that andrew jackson had " some unknown frontal lobe damage " . i have no problem challenging the policy decisions of a particular president . in fact , i disagree with much of jackson 's presidential agenda , especially his bigoted policies directed against american indians . however , i also think it is possible to have political disagreements without resorting to the sort of cheapshots that o ' brien uses . overall , i found the book to be juvenile , mean-spirited and overly negative . there are many better researched and well written books on presidential history out there . so do n't waste your time on this one .

dvd pos 626.txt what a great idea , to make a documentary of violinist hilary hahn traveling around the world and concertizing . undoubtedly at the top of her profession , hahn never fails to amaze with her unmistakably gorgeous tone , enviable precision , and brilliant musicality . this dvd " portrait " includes personal footage of hahn backstage at the philharmonie in berlin , as well as a tour at the curtis institute , a recording session at abbey road studios , and a trip to hong kong . in an age of music commercialism , hahn is refreshingly real and self-deprecating . included on this dvd are excerpts from the korngold concerto , mozart sonata for piano and violin in g major , the lark ascending by vaughan williams , chaconne from partita in d minor by bach , and the paganini concerto no . 1. on the menu there is additional concerto footage , which includes the korngold concerto and mozart sonata in their entirety - thank goodness , because there 's nothing more aggravating than replaying excerpts . if for nothing else , buy the dvd for these complete live recordings , because they are absolutely sublime . the outer movements of the korngold sound a lot like film music , which the classical music lover may or may not like , but the second movement is incredibly beautiful and highly recommended . the mozart sonata is also very well played , but this is nothing new as hahn has already released a recording of this . this dvd is important because it contains video footage of hahn performing - the only other dvd where you can find her playing is the last night of the proms , in which she plays the mozart concerto no . 4 in d major and presto from sonata no . 1 by bach , but the sound quality is somewhat lacking and certainly does n't do justice to hahn

software neg 529.txt this is the worst software i bought . first , it cost $100 and mcafee did not honor the $55 rebate because i sent the rebate form a little late . they had only 15 days to send out after purchase while compusa receipt has much longer deadline to send our rebate form . is n't that kind of trick ? second and most important , it slowed down everything , not a bit but by dozens of seconds or even more than 1 minute . third , the speed is not only the problem , its wireless connection sucks to the maximum and a couple of my machines ca n't get online and ca n't connect to the network . i have 3 pcs and 1 laptop . only two machine can get connected . it also conflicts with belkin network card driver which has been so popular for so many years . how the hell mcafee did not know that adaptor ? fourth , there is no manual whattsover and you have to all figure that out yourself . given it has so much problem it 's very frustrating to configure it . sometimes the security center is downloading forever . who the hell knows what it is doing . sucks . i had spent so much time to fine tune it and it still sucks that much . i changed back to internet security suite which is much better than this . do n't buy it even they give it to you free or you will break the disk .

camera neg 527.txt i will start off by saying , i loved my sony cybershot . when the alpha came out i could n't wait to get one . it died after 200 pictures on day three of a three week once in a life time trip through south america . amazon said it was out of their hands because it must be returned within 30 days . i 've spent 3 hours so far dealing with sony . most people i spoke to or on-line live chat support were unfamiliar with the product and transferred me around to business support , computers , video . they also contradicted one another . when i did get to someone who knew the product i was told firmly that despite the camera being a lemon and malfunctioning after only taking 200 pictures they the would only ' repair it ' not replace it . now i am stuck with a lemon , and i fear i have a history of further disappointment and frustration with this camera . i highly recommend you read all the customer reviews . other people have had problems with the camera , i ignored them because i had faith in sony and thought the other alpha owners ' dud cameras were unusual . if you decide to purchase anyway , i highly recommend you do not buy through amazon , but through a real store with a good and fair return policy , that stands behine their products . places like microcenter will exhange , no questions ask . i am kicking myself because amazon was $100 cheaper then microcenter . penny wise pound foolish . i love amazon , but , i will never buy anything other than books and dvds from them . lesson learned on electronics .

camera pos 290.txt i use this little gadget mainly for macro and portrait work . when you have it on the light emitting from the flash is diffused which gives you a more flattering less contrasty light to illuminate your subjects with . unless you are going for a very shadowy , high-contrast , image this diffuser can save the day . it is very light weight and easy to pack in small places , so you should never have a good reason to leave it behind . sometimes it is the simple things that make the biggest difference in a photo , and using this can defiantly make very noticeable differences

dvd neg 460.txt this version " wind and cloud - the storm riders " made in 2004 is not the same as " the storm riders " made in 1998. this dvd is a condensed version of a tv series packaged by tai seng . it is full-screen and was made for tv . it is pretty disjointed as it was condensed into 2 hours from 30 hours . most people doing the reviews for this dvd is confusing everyone writing positive reviews for the 1998 film staring aaron kwok and ekin chen

software pos 447.txt i bought this title because the first typing instructor for kids got such good reviews . i was looking for a way to teach my 8yo son keyboarding . he has always had a terrible time with handwriting . i knew i needed really easy , slow-paced typing instruction for him , or he would n't get it . well , it 's 6 months later and he can now type ! we did it with nothing but this software . i made him practice about 10 min / day 5 - 7 days / week . all in all , he found it to be work to learn this new skill , but still rather enjoyable . there are 11 games included and several of them are very good - - meaning they are really fun and build typing skills at the same time . there is also a series of drills , lessons , and typing tests to teach the keyboard . the keyboard is introducted a few keys at a time , and then you repeat the related drills , lessons , tests , and games until those keys are learned fairly well . i had to require my son to keep repeating each section of the keyboard until he could do it at 15 wpm before letting him go to the next section . this is what the software recommends , but i had to learn it the hard way . at first , i let my son go ahead too fast and he ended up getting overwhelmed . i ended up having to put a sticker chart on the wall and offering him prizes for getting to 15 wpm on each section . i would recommend this software for children from 6 to about 11. the cartoon characters are very juvenile and would probably offend a child any older than that . however , for any adolescent or adult able to ignore the juvenile cartoons , this would be an excellent way to learn to type too . i found that my typing skills improved just by occasionally using this software .

music pos 771.txt there have been innumerable motorhead collections over the years , but this is one of the few that attempts to mix old with the new . on this collection , all the classics are present , and some newer material is thrown in as well . unfortunately , there are some throw-away tracks , mainly the girlscool and headgirl tracks . ( to be honest , these tracks are pretty much worthless . ) some live tracks are meshed in and fit well , and the newer songs help to add some variety to the old-scool stuff . i would recommend this collection to listeners looking to get a nice , cheap collection of some of motorhead 's best just for the sake of getting into the band . but if you 're wanting the prime collection of older material , save up some extra dough and buy " no remorse " or " stone deaf forever .
health neg 723.txt i had great results with this product with the first use . however , when i used it the second time , the triangular pad lost all of its abrasive surface , leaving me with a smooth , useless triangle . i replaced the triangle , thinking i had a " dud " , but had the same thing happen with the second pad . the cream will work without the pad , but not as effectively . if the manufacturer can come up with a pad that has a more permanent surface , they will have a winner with this product . on a positive note , i love the facial product
books pos 968.txt this is an excellent book . its academic / sociological approach may put off some lay readers , but that would be too bad . the subject , and the message , are both very important . in many ways , this book is similar to & quot ; the appearance of impropriety : how the ethics wars have undermined american government , business and society , & quot ; but although this book is somewhat less accessible to general readers it is certainly stronger from a social-science standpoint . an excellent book , well worth reading for anyone interested in why repeated efforts to stamp out political corruption have borne such mixed ( at best ) results
books pos 391.txt i first encountered this gem of a book when i decided to home educate my children for a few years , and it came with my daughter 's fourth grade calvert school kit . yes , it is european ethnocentric and there are the references to god , but our family was and remains enlightened enough and able to explain *context* even to children . whether you are a bible thumper or dedicated atheist , or somewhere in between , do n't discount this book just because of your beliefs ! there is much that is amazing and simply golden in this book . as a historian , i cannot think of a better way to introduce western civilization to a child . the storybook format is a real winner with kids , and if you 're reading it to them aloud , as i did , well , play editor as you go along ! or take the time to explain the context of the times in which it was written . i will be ordering another copy of this book , as my original copy was stolen by some rather sneaky and acquisitive ex-inlaws ( you know who you are ! ) . this book is a do n't miss . and it is also excellent for adults who do n't like history but recognize the need for such knowledge

camera pos 338.txt pros : - reduces flare and ghosting when shooting in bright light . - helps protect your lens from dirt and scratches . - somewhat protects the lens in case of a fall . better to break the hood than the front element . - makes you look more like you know what you are doing and helps to keep others from carelessly walking in front of you . cons : - will increase lens movement in windy situations , kind of like a sail on a boat . - takes up more room in your bag , even when reversed they still add to the diameter of the lens . - people take more notice of you , will help to blow your cover if you are trying to keep a low profile

health pos 99.txt my wife had high bp , so we got this model . the reasons for choosing this model were that : 1. the upper arm monitors are supposed to be more accurate 2. it was cheaper than the fully automatic models 3. omron seems to be one of the better / best brands . 4. supposedly , the pumps on the fully automatic models are prone to breaking . the unit appears well built ( including the hand pump ) . it is easy to operate , and it seems very accurate . we checked its readings with an fully manual unit that we have at home , and the automatic unit at the drug store . we find it takes very accurate and consistent readings . people with physical limitations might find the hand pump inconvenient . also , people with a big arm might need to buy the larger cuff . i 'm overweight right now , so the cuff barely fits my arm , but fits my wife 's nicely ( it was bought for her )
books neg 483.txt i enjoy reading sports fiction with my 10 year old son . the descriptions of this book suggested it addressed important themes which transcended basketball . however , as i read the book , i found the treatment of those themes quite superficial . in addition the book was bawdy . while it may accurately reflect locker room mentality , many readers may not find that mentality entertaining . it is not an appropriate book for children
dvd pos 98.txt this movie is funny and by being so bold in so many ways is refreshing . it presents realistic characters without worrying about offending people by presenting sterotypes . it takes the time to develope the story effectively without boring the audience . it is a long movie but it moves at a great and effective pace . it is full of laughs . joe pesci is one of the best comic actors of all time . i do n't think that anyone else could have pulled of the part of vinny nearly as well . marisa was great as well and it was hard to find a performance that was less than great . the writing and directing , two things that often get overlooked , was wonderful . the only weakness ? the case is a little fantastic . it is hard to believe the coincidences in the movie that lead to the boys being accused of the crime . of course movie plots do n't have to make perfect sense but this stretches it . though i usually do n't like excessive foul language , this movie uses it in a funny way . i guess it would n't work without it.. . but do n't be mistaken....it has a lot of bad language . do n't let kids under 17 watch it without supervision

camera pos 336.txt canon makes a great underwater housing for a reasonable price . i purchased this for a recent trip to grand cayman and cozumel . i did n't go scuba diving on this trip , but i did take the camera snorkeling ( diving to depths ~20ft ) . it worked flawlessly and i got some pictures i was very happy with ! one thing i did not anticipate was the use the camera got out of the water . going from ac to the hot humid outdoors , my eos rebel fogged up ( condensation ) and even after 30 minutes i could n't take good pictures . with the sd110 in the uw housing , i just wipped the housing 's glass portal with a lens tissue after it had warmed up a couple of minutes and i was able to take clear pictures . the instructions are pretty good , but it took me a while to figure out how to take out the o-ring seal for cleaning / lubing . once i figured it out , it was n't so hard . the sd110 may be getting a little old , but it still takes decent pictures and even with the housing i do n't have so much money tied up in the system that i would be devestated if it was lost or stolen . i will probably upgrade to the sd550 or sd500 ( they both use the same batteries as the sd110 ) with the wp-dc80 or wp-dc70 housing at some time in the near future , but i will definitely keep the sd110 and wp-dc10 as backups
software neg 712.txt we have used quickbooks on a pc since the 1990's . we loved the way inuit made accounting accessible for people without degrees in accounting . quickbooks for mac is terrible in comparison . if you plan to use the payroll features , it is unusable . quickbooks mac payroll redirects you to the internet , where it is handled by paycycle ( an independent company ) . payroll is not integrated at all in the mac ( instead import / export operation ) . on the pc , it is part of the quickbooks application . we could not get job costing to work , and the tax calculations made no sense . we were paying tons of money to paycycle , so fortunately the taxes were filed automatically . we finally reverted back to quickbooks for windows and are much happier with intuit handling our payroll

books neg 389.txt " the other boleyn girl " and " the queen 's fool " are two of the best books i 've ever read- -and i 've read a lot of books , especially about this period , which especially fascinates me . they were gripping to the end , and my involvement with the characters was complete- -true masterpieces . so whenever a new book by philippa gregory comes out , i buy it , hoping to have the same experience , and lately have been sorely disappointed . " the virgin 's lover " fell flat , and now i am trying to read this book but not finding myself engaged , must give it up . one reviewer suggested the books were being written too quickly- -that is always an easy guess , however it depends on the writer . anthony trollope , for instance , was able to turn out amazing book after amazing book with incredible speed . that may or may not be the case with gregory . i know , as a writer myself , that there are times when the work flows out , feeling almost as if it 's channeled from another source , and times when it 's harder , more mechanical . the more challenging situations are those when i 'm not entirely convinced or in love with my subject . so to me , neither of these books feels as if they spring from a natural impulse . they feel forced , constructed . i 'm going back to trollope

books pos 609.txt i read the pig man by paul zindel for a summer vacation assignment . in all , i do not enjoy reading books , but i was surprised by the humor in this book . when i was reading it , i would have to stop reading and i would start laughing . it would take a while to calm myself down . it first started with john and lorraine , then a lot of strange things started to happen to them . the old man that they where trying to prank call , was actually going to give them money . when they meet him it all changed . they where worried because they lied to him and did not know what to do . they told him the truth and became good friends with the pig man . they called him the pig man because his name was mr. pignati , and he collected hundreds of little pig statues . john and lorraine learned a lot about the importance of life as they grew to love the pig man . this sad story has to taught them how to move on after a loved one has died .

dvd pos 877.txt in 1987 and 1988 , jim henson 's the storyteller aired and became an instant showpiece for television , a truimphant ( but short-lived ) series breathing fresh life into nine lesser-known northern european fairy tales and , later , into four timeless stories drawn from greek mythology . these old folk and fairy tales , mined from countries such as germany and russia and compiled in 2 discs here , along with the greek tales , are vigorously and appealingly narrated by two storytellers : john hurt for the european fables and michael gambon for the greek re-tellings . but , with much respect to mr. gambon , who himself does a fine job , it is john hurt who decidedly draws my attention . hurt , with the more eye-catching portrayal , is ideal as he inhabits his storytelling character with a gleeful and quirky charm and a mischievous twinkle in his eyes . it does n't hurt that the stories featuring hurt as the host boast clever and sensitive screenplays written by anthony minghella , who , nearly a decade later , would win an oscar for directing the english patient . as such , jim henson 's the storyteller gloriously lives up to its titular billing . john hurt 's performance sparkles with his enchanting delivery as , propelled by his captivating voice and effectively off-kilter mannerisms and abetted by heavy make-up , he evokes a rich verbal miasma which sucks the listener in to his stories . minghella 's screenplays are replete with rich , witty wordplay and evocative descriptives that indeed recall to mind the classic fairy tales with which we grew up . the kids , of course , wo n't have that frame of reference , but , still , watching these episodes , it really does feel as if you 're sitting around the fire , enraptured at the feet of a master spinner of yarns . michael gambon , on the other hand , is burdened with the weightier and grimmer greek tales . thus , he eschews john hurt 's light , ebullient touch , opting instead to display a more proper and somber persona . he 's pretty good , mind you , but , in the final analysis , he ends up lacking a bit of something when compared to john hurt . both hurt and gambon , by the way , are accompanied by the same mangy talking dog ( as operated by brian henson ) . at a half hour per episode , jim henson 's the storyteller is presented in a marriage of live acting , creative animatronics , and surreal and stylishly vivid imagery . jim henson and his crew do a marvelous job with the production values , coming up with excellent special effects ( for its time ) , seamless puppetry , matte paintings , and yeoman make-up work , all to plant the viewer firmly in their fantasy setting . a charming quirk of the series , which adds a nice touch , is the interesting ways the folk tale would continue to make its presence felt during the occasional interludes with the storyteller and his dog . the camera would cut away from the story and focus on our host by the fireplace , but , somewhere in the background , whether it 's on a painting in the back or on the surface of a display jar or cup , images depicting the story are set in motion . pretty neat . the stories themselves are more mature and darker in essence than any kid 's fable we 're used to over here , especially the greek entries , and several carry melancholy and bittersweet overtones ( " the soldier and death , " " the heartless giant " ) . but do n't keep the kids from watching this series ; everyone should get a chance to fall under the spell and feel the power of stories . it does help that most of these tales are little known in the states , thereby giving the viewer a chance to enjoy the unfolding of a fresh story and be actually startled here and there . when was the last time cinderella or beauty and the beast , timeless as they are , offer up anything new ? this is just about as perfect as television shows can get ; the only flaw i can come up with lies in the dvd set as it comes with no special features whatsoever . all the episodes are superb , but if i had to pick the best of the pack , i would definitely go with " hans my hedgehog , " " the soldier and death " and " the three ravens . " with several recognizable name actors lending their talents to this series , jim henson 's the storyteller : the definitive collection truly is a must have dvd set . ************************************************************************** spoilers follow . the nine european fables : " hans my hedgehog " - from an early german folk tale : a barren peasant woman , desperately craving a child , naively says aloud that if she had a baby , she would n't care what it looks like . soon enough , she gives birth to a baby who resembles a hedgehog , much to the father 's dismay and the scorn of the villagers . " fearnot " - from an early german folk tale : a carefree , absent-minded boy who never scares goes on a strange journey to learn fear . though still very good , this may be the weakest episode of the lot . gabrielle anwar has a tiny nonspeaking role . " a story short " - from an early celtic folk tale : the storyteller himself is in the spotlight as he narrates the time he was caught making a fool of the royal cook and , as punishment meted out by the king , must tell one story a day for a year . all goes well until the very last day when the storyteller suffers from storyteller 's block . brenda blethyn has a part . " the luck child " - from an early russian folk tale : seeking to avert a prophecy which foretells of a seventh son of a seventh son of someday supplanting the current king , the unscrupulous monarch seeks out this luck child and attempts to do away with him . but those blessed with luck cannot be undone...and the same could be said for prophecies . the soldier & death " - from an early russian folk tale , this is an awesome story . because of kind acts towards three beggars , an honest soldier returning from war is given a magical sack , a deck of cards , and a nice whistle , which he uses to save a kingdom and to foil death . " the true bride " - from an early german folk tale . shades of aslan ! a white lion comes to the aid of a girl ( jane horrocks , little voice ) being held under the cruel care of a troll . co-starring sean bean . " the three ravens " - from an early german folk tale : a wicked witch ( miranda richardson ) weds a widowed king ( jonathan pryce ) and then , recognizing that the king 's three sons and daughter pose a threat to her ambition , transforms the three sons into ravens . but the princess ( joely richardson ) escapes and is told by her brothers that , unless she remains speechless for three years , three months , and three days , they 'll be trapped in their raven forms forever . " sapsorrow " - from an early german folk tale : this is a variant on cinderella ( or is it the other way around ? ) as a beautiful princess ( the unimpressive alison doody ) , seeking to escape an arranged marriage , flees to a distant kingdom and disguises herself as a loathsome hag . but , then , she falls in love with the prince...co-starring jennifer saunders . " the heartless giant " - from an early german folk tale : on the whole , giants are benign creatures , harmless to none , unless , of course , the giant has n't a heart . this story is about a curious prince who is fooled into freeing one such heartless giant from the king 's dungeon.. . the greek myths : " daedalus and icarus " - the inventor daedalus and his son icarus flee from the wicked king minos with the aid of daedalus 's man-made wings , but will icarus heed his father 's advice ? i 'm guessing , not . " orpheus and eurydice " - the musician orpheus descends to hades to bring back his dead wife . " perseus and the gorgon " - the hero perseus faces the gorgon , medusa . " theseus and the minotaur " - it 's theseus , with some help from a beautiful princess , versus the savage minotaur , half-man , half-bull .

software pos 334.txt after going insane with the new version of norton systemworks 2005 , which does n't even install , i decided to finally swear off all symantec products . i have used zone alarm pro for some time . it 's not perfect , but it certainly will protect your computer . i took the plunge and went with the full security suite this week , and i 've been relatively happy . on the plus side , the software works really well . the personal firewall is better than any you can find , and the virus protection found a phishing app that norton had not ( before i had unstalled it ) . on the minus side , the firewall can be problematic . i 've had page load issues on ebay and on my own site which has a cgi script to keep my images and files from being hotlinked ( bandwidth theft ) . when i visit my site or any other that has a similar anti-theft cgi script , the images simply wo n't come up . ebay gets all messed up as well . i have n't been able to figure out a setting that works , so i have to turn off the firewall on ebay and a few other sites , which kind of defeats the purpose of a firewall . this does n't happen a lot though , so it 's not annoying enough to get my dander up . all in all it 's been a far better investment than symantec products , so despite its limitations i would recommend this program . it does have a lot of options to set , but they are pretty easy to get through if you are computer literate . if you decide to go with this program and you currently have norton antivirus , you will need to uninstall norton before this program will run . if you were to ask me if i preferred symantec systemworks or zone alarm security suite , there would be absolutely no hesitation in recommending zone alarm .
music neg 482.txt i liked this when it first came out b / c i was 16. i was a rebel , wanted to be part of something different . this is their best work since the weirdness does get lame after a while . favorite song is mongoloid...totally strange but rocking song . " uncontrollable urge " rocks ( in a weird way ) and come back johnny is almost a conventional song . satisfaction is completely unique but its not a good song . the group was obviously trying to do more than music and develop a kiss , multi media , making money kind of thing . i saw them live ( they were horrible ) during their hey day . the most interesting thing about them is while other odd bands were eventually accepted and integrated into the mainstream , devo is still as odd of a group as ever . mark motherbough does a lot of soundtrack work ( rugrats ) and you can hear the devo in all of his work . anybody that gives this novelty group 5 stars is cheapening what true excellent music is . devo came out as a goof , not as serious musicians . they got big in the 70 's b / c they were part of the new wave and kids ( like me ) were looking for alternative music that we can claim our own .
books neg 479.txt for years , i had heard the akashic records being touted as the unwritten spiritual book of life , that included every event , every living soul who had ever taken a breath from the beginning of time through eternity . the subject was beyond fascinating , as my limited mortal mind could not grasp the enormity of such a body of knowledge " existing " . however , i took it on absolute faith that this was so and recently endeavored to find the quintessential book on the subject . knowing of mr. cayce 's tremendous psychic following , i assumed this book would enlighten me and others . i excitedly bought a new copy for myself and sent another to a friend . after trudging through the first 68 pages , i felt lost and befuddled . the writing and text are difficult to follow and not at all in " layperson 's " language . perhaps this book is meant for an experienced psychic mind and intellect , one who understands the language and is willing to muddle through the long-winded case histories to discover meaning and relevance . my friend confessed she had read a mere chapter or two , then set it aside . pie dumas author & life coach

software neg 674.txt i have 3 computers with different expiration dates for the installed norton anti-virus programs . i purchased the 3-pack and installed it into the computers as the old subscriptions expired . i then found out that the clock for the 3 units started when the program was installed into the first computer . when i contacted norton , they acknowledged that it was designed that way and gave me a code to enter into the three computers in order to increase their protection to a full . when the code was entered into the first computer the clock increased to 1 year in that computer . norton would not allow the code to be entered into the other 2 computers . i will never purchase another norton product

dvd pos 373.txt this film was probably hurt a bit by the fact it had to have its fall 2001 release postponed due to 9 / 11 ( it 's plot included terrorists that sell a bomb ) . i also imagine the marketing was tough since it had to be sold based on tim allen and the comparisons to " get shorty " rather than as a plot driven movie . i tell you though , this film is simply funny . just like an old marx brothers film , the plot is there only to set in motion the quick-witted dialogue and interaction between the characters . i have enjoyed both of dave barry 's humor novels ( this and " tricky business " ) . they made me laugh out loud as did this movie . i think it captures the spirit of the book perfectly . for those that have laughed at dennis farina from his roles in " get shorty and even " snatch , " he has never been funnier as a hit man who encounters unexpected roadblocks ( literally ) on his trip to do a quick sniper job . tom sizemore is also excellent as the dumbest crook you 'll ever see . there are some movies that you may see once in the theaters yet can watch over and over everytime it is on tv because it retains the ability to always make you laugh , no matter how many times you have seen it . check this one out !

dvd neg 367.txt well , this was about as formulaically politically correct as a movie can get , unfortunately : the female teenage protagonist ( played by witherspoon , whose acting powers have increased dramatically since her stilted acting here ) acts masculine and heroic , the male teenage protagonist acts craven and flippant . at one ridiculous point , the girl runs around acting like a commando , a veritable one-gal army , blowing up the bad guys , while the boy hides in a cave sniveling . later , when the boy tries to assert himself by offering to carry the gal 's backpack as they cross a desert , the gal snaps at him , bella abzug-style , and walks quickly ahead , leaving him in the dust . clearly a modern radical feminist thing going on here , and what is most unfortunate is that this movie was made for a young audience and therefore is in keeping with the modern radical feminist propaganda which is brainwashing young women into unnaturally behaving like men . of course , in the real world , the result for such manly girls , once they become women , is that men do not choose them and they remain alone , and therefore become bitter- -ironically and inevitably blaming men , of course . in this movie , the wimpy teenage guy falls for the brassy , masculine gal- -but that 's why they call them movies . when are these post-modern writers , artists , and other culture-shapers with an agenda going to realize that when they tout modern radical feminism , they are touting something unnatural- -men simply do not prefer masculine females . men want someone to complement them , not compete with them . men crave femininity in females , not feminism . wow , is there ever a difference in those two forms of comportment ! this poor teenage guy depicted in this movie , at least his character does progress a little bit : by the end of the movie , instead of craven and flippant , he graduates to something akin to a metrosexual-type with a wild-boy haircut , if that is even a step upward . but the plucky gal- -she 's still the one in charge in this fictitious world of upside-down gender relations . uh , another problem with this movie- -and there are many- -is when the kids are going through the kalahari desert , something which should be , and for a time is here depicted as , a foreboding and life-threatening task . yet we see witherspoon in this desert frolicking with a dog ; and we see the boy 's flippancy and joviality emerge in a totally out-of-place manner , considering the dire situation they are in . the sense of urgency which had been built up is totally excreted away by these light-hearted , inane scenes . look , i dig disney kid movies- -more realistic ones . you know , old style disney movies . you take " old yeller " for example . now there was a quality kid movie , and quite true to life . this movie was not . it had a plastic , spoiled-american-materialistic-teenybopper feel throughout . disney has gone down the tubes . in any number of ways , they 've been subverted by radical marxist agendas ( note : one more of these was the fact that an african bushman was allowed to evince a pagan ritual from his pc pagan religion- -something called " tapping , " while the caucasians were of course not shown evincing any sign of their un-pc judeo-christian religion- -this is bias , folks , leftwing , pc bias , same as the aforementioned feminist bilge ) . i am learning to run , not walk , away from disney stuff , and this movie was further cause for me to do so .

dvd pos 79.txt nowadays , hollywood just would n't have the balls to make a film that spits in the face of terrorism , unless it was an easy target that does n't spit back ( aka , america and it 's 1st amendment ) . this film harkens back to the day when people wished our country 's foreign policy was a bit more leathery . well...ya got it now ! at the very least , a film like this would piss off the surrender-monkeys in the jackass party , not only for what they would see as a glorification of nationalistic jingoism , but for the villification and slaughter of stalinistic , castro-like communists that they would only want to capitulate and make peace with . makes one wonder if the lefty glenn close now hates herself for acting in such a film . what would they say to a film like this ? unfortunately , there 's plenty of room for criticism in this movie , aside from the political implications therein . some ( arguably , if not all ) of the special effects seemed a bit hokey ( hence the 4 stars instead of the five ) . i think if anyone wanted to be bipartisan about anything , it would have to be the 90 's style cgi , especially the plane crash . at best , one might go so far as to say it was " cute . " and what can a guy like me say to that ? even as i write this review , scarcely 2 days have past from the red letter day in the struggle against terrorism , in which the ruthless terrorist leader of al qaida in iraq , al-zarqawi , caught himself a couple of 500 lb . bombs with the use of his house . for those who want to keep westerners depressed and demoralized ( not a far stretch from " fear-mongering , " right ? ) in the fight against terrorism , this deals a disappointing blow to those who hate america . what 's worse , they ca n't seem to ban a film exalting american nationalism such as " air force one " from those who wish to see it ( oh no ! ) . and just 2 years ago the same whiners were bitching about " the passion . " sucks to have the 1st amendment apply to every american and not just the idealistic " intellectual " few , does n't it

music pos 581.txt eloy ( name taken from h g well ` s time machine ) is a german atmospheric , progressive art rock band that was formed back in 1969. through the years , personal wise , the band has totally turned over , in some positions , several times . their originator frank bornemann ( guitars / vocals ) has persevered , presiding over a three decade band , that has turned out some of the best progressive rock music , i 've had the fortune to hear . ocean ocean , their sixth album , released in 1977 , is a concept album , depicting the rise and fall of atlantis . though there are only four tracks , they average almost eleven minutes each . many eloy aficionados point to this album as their ` tour de force' . it is excellent , but as far as i 'm concerned , based on what i 've heard so far , there is no album that stands heads above the others . overall , ocean has an atmospheric ambience reminiscent of hawkwind or a more unknown band that i once reviewed named ship of fools . it also reminds me jeff wayne 's , war of the worlds . track listing 1. poseidon 's creation ( 11:38 ) **** has a long droning medium pace and a whinny guitar intro . at the 4:40 mark , bornemann finally begins the vocal . there is quite a lot of guitar playing on this song , augmented occasionally by the synth . 2. incarnation of the logos ( 8:25 ) **** has an atmospheric vocal beginning . the song does n't seem to have much of a melody until the 3:40 mark when the synth / organ takes over with a pleasant one , assisted by some percussion and a bell now and then . 3. decay of the logos ( 8:15 ) ***½ the shortest song at eight minutes seems a little jerky at first with more monologue than music . when it does get going after about three minutes it 's still jerky in a medium paced beat . strong synth playing through the middle . 4. atlantis ' agony at june 5th - 8498 , 13 p.m. gregorian earthtime ( 15:35 ) ***** this is a monster song . it is like nothing i 've ever heard . except for a fifty some second monologue at the beginning , " atlantis.. . " starts with a truly intriguing eight minute plus instrumental intro . not just any intro , like you 're used to , with a full orchestra and violins . no this is an spacey atmospheric intro that would make the great pink floyd , envious , with the propitious use of ghostly sounds and special effects segueing into an amazing five minute organ bridge , with no beat just the hammond a few side effects and you . no it does n't get boring . instead it sets you up for the vocals , which issue forth at about the eight minute mark . slowly the rhythm section establishes a slow beat , while the singer does a great imitation of bob dylan , with a remarkable spacey synth breaking in between the vocal . but we 're not done . with about two minutes left , the band picks up the tempo to a medium fast tempo ( the first time i ` ve heard them play at this speed ) . now the violins join in with the guitar and synth for the finale of this great finale . total time : 43:53 line-up - frank bornemann / guitars , vocals - klaus-peter matziol / basses , vocals - jürgen rosenthal / drums , percussion , flute - detlev schmidtchen / keyboards , mellotron , xylophone , voice - the boys of santiago / chorus ( 1 ) conclusion one of the factors , i find appealing about this band , is that in the span of three decades , they managed to present a style of music which was compatible with each era , so listening to their albums from different periods gives us a window into the progressive music of various time periods . eloy 's musical tempo almost never exceeds medium and on ocean tends to be more in the medium slow range . listening to this and other eloy albums i hear influences from numerous other bands . like many prog bands i hear pink floyd but i also hear uriah heep , moody blues and bob dylan ( really , on track four ! )

books neg 778.txt i can see how instructors would be enthusiastic about this book , but unfortunately it will in no way help the student develop their ear training . here 's the problem . the book and cd basically outlines a method of ear training , it is not ear training itself . for example , for each step of the book there is one and only one example on the cd . it is just that , an example , not a training . so , there is one 14 note " lesson " on intervals and from this you are supposed to magically learn how to identify all the major intervals . i do n't think so . however , if you were an instructor then you could use that example as a starting point to develop your own lessons and work with students in recognizing intervals . you could spend a month on variations of that lesson itself since that 's the core of ear training . in fact , if you 're an instructor you can use the whole book as a blueprint for a year long curriculum from recognizing intervals to recognizing chords . by the way , the cd itself mostly uses really dull organ patches . the idea may have been to eliminate timbre as a distraction . however , since one of the goals of ear training is to distinguish timbre from tone , this is another example of how this book / cd in itself wo n't be of much use to students .
books neg 811.txt i first read this book back in the mid-80s after watching the miniseries starring gary cole as dr. jeffrey macdonald . the miniseries absolutely riveted me , as did this book . but upon repeated readings , i began to pick up inaccuracies and errors . i found that the book , rather than answering questions about this case , caused me to question more and more . joe mcginniss , while never a stellar writer to begin with , was eventually exposed as the worst kind of writer , twisting facts and quotes to serve his own purpose , which was to sell his theory and therefore , his book . i have nothing against mr. mcginniss forming his own opinion as to dr. macdonald 's guilt or innocence , but to omit certain facts and blatantly lie about others and misquote principals and research in order to further your own propaganda is sickening . if you want joe mcginniss ' theory on how and why the murders happened , with no regard to the cold hard facts and legal evidence , pick this book up . if you want to read about the case , with all the facts in place both supporting and questioning dr. macdonald , do as other reviewers have suggested and read " fatal justice " , a far more in-depth review of the case and evidence and form your own opinion .
dvd neg 444.txt so i decided maybe i 'll give this exploitation thing a try considering i love gore , violence , and horror movies . the reason i give it a 1 star is because it just is n't that good of a movie . it 's very boring for most of the movie . about the first 20 or so minutes few words are even said . then the guys just rape this woman several times , then she comes back for a very unsatisfying revenge . it 's very slow paced and does n't live up to the hype . it is n't all that gory , and it is n't scary either . also , the rape is n't that convincing . i 'm not saying i need everything shown in detail , but the acting is so bad it makes it seem as if its not even a big deal . oh , and the woman gets revenge on one of the men who raped her...and he was practically mentally retarded . the guy really just fell in with the wrong crowd and they convinced him to do something bad . that is not grounds for what she did to him , which in my opinion was the worst of the killings . anyways . not that good of a movie , do n't let the lure of sleaze and violence make you think it will be worth your time because its not
books neg 482.txt i was hoping the book would be good . most reviews are . however the topics are not really covered at all , more introduced . it was like talking to a drunk bloke about sports , most points are important and relevant but its presented in a way that makes it confusing . they openly admit they dont want the book to be rated on the quality of the english . just as well , long rambling thaughts that do n't form conclusions . not what i wanted or needed . it actually manages to take the fun out of reading and texas holdem all in one go
music neg 733.txt collective soul had a few nice attempts toward pop music like dosage . the main problem i have with this album is none of the songs are hits so no airwaves and the fact that the album probably has about 7 fillers ! its just to flawed to recommend to everyone it may be if you are a diehard collective soul fans . i wouldnt lose this album but i wouldnt buy it again
music pos 353.txt i 'm biased , because i loved the movie and adore the book . gregson-williams does an outstanding job here ( before this , i was most familiar with his score work on metal gear solid videogames ) . the music is extremely touching and magical . the " evacuating london score " ( from the scene in the train station ) tugs at the heartstrings . and the " battle score " brings back the images of the dynamic battle at the movie 's climax . one song that 's missing is the 1940s jazz song played in the movie when the kids are playing hide and seek . other than that absence ( probably due to copyright restrictions ) , this is an excellent cd . as for the " bonus " dvd - i probably would n't purchase it if i had a second chance . it 's got some nice gallery art of movie stills and concept art . there is only one trailer , and it is not the very first one released , which opens with the kids at the mansion and really gets the blood pumpin ' with its intro of the wardrobe . there are also behind-the-scenes interviews i have n't watched yet , but i wonder if they 'll appear again when the movie dvd is released .
software neg 479.txt i feel duped ! i bought spy sweeper at the computer store a year ago . it was the 2.6 version . at first everything was great . i got my definitions , it found traces , it detected spy cookies . when i ran the definition update , i had no problem with the firewall . every time they said upgrade , i did . then i started getting renew e-mail . i had months to go and they sent me renewal e-mails sometimes two or three a week and i ignored them , not only because i knew the year was n't up , but i also was suspicious that it was just another spammer out to get my credit card information . i e-mailed them asking if their renew mails were really from them , voicing my concerns . i got ignored , to when i eventually got to speak to someone , they did n't even know what their renewal e-mail looked like ! the problems began when i updated the latest version which is the 4.5. when i would try to update my definitions i 'd get a warning that there 's was a problem and contact webroot , while it had no problem noting that i had the latest version updates . no settings were changed , not even my firewall which was blamed by them . i think it 's them not me since now it 's suddenly happening . they refuse to address it . then i checked their site about my subscritpion . i knew i had one because i bought it at the store , my subscription does n't expire until june and if i was invalid i doubt i could upgrade to newer versions . what did their page say ? no subscription ! when i wrote i never got a straight answer about it . then i was told that the program was corrupted , download a new copy of the latest version from their site . i did . what did i get ? boxes that said subscription not activated . they knew i had one and they wo n't change it on their site or give me explanations . after pestering does my latest version now say when i expire . i 've asked why it goes online to scan when it does n't need to and i get ignored . so i decided to call but was n't sure how because i 'm in a different time zone . it took several days for them to get back to me by e-mail saying that their mountain time is treated like my eastern time to get a hold of someone . the first person i spoke to after four tries at 15-20 rings each , was nasty , especially when i told him to slow down because he mumbled . i downloaded what he told me to do , he said nothing about the firewall issue despite him telling me he read my tickets about it.the second person sounded like he 'd smoked one too many joints after he decided to answer the phone after 15 rings . he did n't know how to answer any of my firewall questions or why their page kept saying i had no subscription when the program in it 's latest version finally admitted i 'm current after pestering . they do n't give you straight e-mail answers . they do n't answer their phones hoping that after the 15th ring you 'll give up . it wo n't scan everything even when no other programs are running . in the new version it found a spy cookie , it kept repeating the same one over and over despite my checking it as " always remove " .never did that with the previous versions . i do n't like a company who answers questions selectively . i do n't like a company who makes you wait 20 rings . i do n't like a company who blames your computer settings when they never affected the previous versions . webroot 's spy sweeper will be replaced in my desperate search to find a spyware program that actually works , and whose staff answers my questions and not mislead me about my subscription status

dvd pos 579.txt victor hugo 's enormous output is unique in french literature.. . he was described as ' the most powerful mind of the romantic movement ' and his novel , published in 1862 , continued to be widely read.. . the plot - that of a detective - is as well the epic of the people of paris.. . its author claimed it as a ' religious ' work , and indeed by means of its characters , sometimes a little larger than life , yet always vital and engaging , and by its re-creation of the swarming parisian underworld , the main theme of man 's ceaseless combat with evil clearly emerges while the whole gives a faithful picture of the declines and flow of life.. . hugo relives his youth in this vast novel , the culmination of 14 years work.. . he and valjean share their most outstanding characteristic : their charitable heart.. . the story contains glimpses of hugo 's disgust towards ' the treatment of the lower class french citizens by the government : valjean , an ex-convict recently released from prison , but he is not given the opportunity to make a good living for himself ; fantine forced into prostitution due to the lack of money to pay her illegitimate child.. . and towards the ' general injustice of the law enforcement system : valjean sentenced to prison for stealing a loaf of bread ; fantine arrested for hitting a man of a higher class.. . the symbol of france 's greed that hugo despises is thenardier - the man that fantine entrusts cosette to - who betrays the trust by essentially making cosette his personal slave.. . the strongest emotions of " les misérables are love and hate.. . javert and valjean are both extremes , with a conscience incredibly strict.. . liam neeson is cast as the gentle valjean who takes the twist of fate parlaying it into personal success and moral rehabilitation.. . he changes his ways to become years later the much-loved mayor of vigau , and as a caring businessman he struggles to forget the past and manages to redeem his soul becoming benevolent , giving manual and financial help to the weak , sick and poor.. . after nine years , valjean was horrified to discover that javert - a former guard of the quarries of toulon , where he served almost 20 years - has arrived to be the head of vigau 's police force.. . valjean 's desire to protect the employees from bad influences leads him to fire ( indirectly ) one of his workers fantine - turned prostitute.. . he assumes responsibility for raising her daughter cosette.. . he becomes a father figure and soon forces the choice of sacrificing his own freedom for her happiness.. . geoffrey rush plays the icy chief inspector javert , the man who tries " to live his life without breaking a single rule . " when he is given the job of spying in the barricades and valjean gives him his freedom instead of shooting him , things begin to fall apart for him.. . the action of mercy of jean valjean causes him to doubt the solid base of his existence.. . he is in emotional agony unable to betray his convictions.. . he sees too late the truth.. . valjean 's legendary physical strength are enough to stir his suspicion that the town mayor is a fraud.. . he is less villain than a man driven by his own hard concept of justice begging permission of his superiors in paris to investigate the mayor , the man he believes is a convict.. . when he thinks he has made a mistake in identifying monsieur le maire as the ' convict ' jean valjean , he insists on informing him that he has denounced him unjustly and that therefore he must be dismissed : " you must punish me " , he says , " or my life will have been meaningless . " ( a key line in the film ) . uma thurman approaches the self-indulgent character of fantine with admirable restraint , giving a certain level of charm and charisma to the film.. . she gives her sick mother role a good amount of realism demonstrating her character 's frustration and pain exquisitely.. . fantine 's misery overwhelms her as she sells her body to support her child.. . being in a wild state , enraged at how she is a helpless victim of misery , she is arrested after being humiliated by several would-be customers , but valjean intercedes on her behalf overriding javert 's authority.. . when valjean helps her , she begins to rediscover hope.. . her joy at the thought of having cosette with her is great.. . but the shock of valjean 's arrest and the discover that cosette is not there , are too much for the poor creature.. . claire danes plays the teenage cosette who realizes one day that she has become quite beautiful.. . she disobeys her father 's rules by secretly sneaking out and seeing marius - a charismatic young parisian revolutionary - with whom she fell in love.. . cosette spends her childhood as a servant girl at the thenardier 's inn , horribly mistreated and constantly terrified.. . she grew up in a convent , innocent , pure and a bit naïve.. . peter vaughan is excellent as the compassionate bishop whose act of generosity turns an embittered valjean around.. . bille august tries to capture the essence of hugo 's morality staging its political turmoil strongly enough to give it contemporary resonance , keeping the eternal three elements : the bishop handing over the candlesticks ; fantine 's collapse ; marius crying out : " to the barricades ! " history does n't change , as voltaire once remarked.. . but what we need from it , does.. . valjean 's story is not unique , it 's universal.. . in other world , it 's contemporary.. . there are certainly enough " les misérables " to go all around the world.. .

camera neg 910.txt i 've just returned this unit . it does n't play videos as advertised . i was able to get it to properly play .avi files at 320 x 240 resolution...see other review below . but 320x240 gives a postage stamp size picture . at 640 x 480 the playback was full size but jerky and broken....more later . i have now had 3 different brands of 8 " photo frames in my possession : a phillips , a pandigital , and this coby . i have developed the following list of features in my " ideal " photo frame . first , video playback : i 've been taking a lot of video clips with my digital still camera...they come out well and the convenience of not having to lug my camcorder along , and the ability to quickly transfer clip files within / between chips and my computer is attractive . i would like a frame which will play the format my camera is taking ( .mov , more later ) i 'd also like the frame to play a multi-media show...that is , to play movie clips in show presentations , intermixed with .jpg photo files . second feature is to play .wma music files , in addition to mp3. this is because i have a non-ipod personal music player . all my music is in .wma format because it is roughly half the file size of mp3. third , i would like a timer on my frame...set it to come on in the morning , off at night , for example . fourth , i 'd like an audio or speaker out feature . none of these frames has home theater-like sound , and i have an extra pair of computer speakers i 'd probably hook up . video out could come in handy too . fifth , i 'd like to be able to rotate stills from within the frame 's software , manually or automatically . yes , you can rotate them in the computer , but the frame may or may not preserve the rotation . ( this may depend on which photo edit program you are using . ) sixth , i 'd like a folder hierarchy file management system in the frame 's software . especially with the huge chips now available , i see an advantage to push a couple of buttons and change the picture set ( folder ) , rather than switching out chips . here is where the 3 units i 've had stack up , followed by my next ( fourth ) unit . i am keeping the pandigital....which costco has for $140. it plays .mov video files , but not within a slideshow . it has no speaker out jack and the sound is tinny . it requires mp3 music files . it permits picture rotation . no folder management system . no clock / timer . no ability to play stills / video intermixed . i think the coby and phillips picture quality is brighter but the pandigital is ok . the phillips did n't play video , and since it also had a software glitch when i returned it i decided to look elsewhere . ( no remote and no music with the philips either . ) the coby wo n't play my videos , even after i used my converter program to try about 10 different mp4 and avi variations . the coby plays .wma music files , wo n't rotate stills , has no folder system , no clock / timer . it has a speaker out jack . it does not permit intermixing video and stills in one multimedia show . picture quality is fully equal to philips , generally the recognized standard . if all you want is photos , and never turn your camera sideways , this unit will be a good value . another unit i 'd like to get to play with would be the image moments model by digitalfoci . i 've exchanged emails with someone there who clearly knows what they are talking about and i believe this unit will intermix my photos and videos .

music pos 282.txt first , i 'd like to say that i am so glad there are artists like amel around who are n't trying to fit in with today 's commercial r&b scene . as a long time fan of r&b and soul music i ca n't help but feel sad and dissapointed at the direction the genre is taking , especially in regards to female singers . she may be beautiful , but she does n't need to use her looks to overcompensate for any lack of vocal talent by flaunting herself . amel has a beautiful soul , and you can hear that through her wonderful voice and lyrics . every song on this album has at some point or another touched me , some songs straight away while others grew on me slowly . you know how sometimes when you 're listening to music and a particular lyric or vocal piece makes you shiver ? amel 's got that down for me . i was firstly introduced to nusoul by teedra moses , someone who i 've admired for two years now , and who to me seemed one of the few decent r&b singers left . through teedra i stumbled on amel 's " bravebird " and became more and more curious as i listened to the album over and over . like with most nu / soul , the love i have for each song grew slowly , and songs i thought were n't for me suddenly became my favorites on the album . i love that about amel ; she makes me suprise myself , as i become emotionally involved with her music and voice over time until i 'm enchanted . " for real " hit me instantly as a beautiful song . i never get tired of it 's cute opening where amel 's daughter babbles something in baby talk ! i 'd love to talk about each song individually , but i 'd probably just bore you . to me amel 's music is a personal experience , and most likely strikes people in different ways . i will mention however , " congo " - one of the songs on there i was tempted to skip at first but has fast become something of an obsession which crops into my head throughout the days , with it 's monotonous jungle vibe . other personal favorites include " we can be new " , " say you want it " , " all i got2 " ... hell the whole album really . along with other outstanding artists of the nu-soul genre , amel has succesfully metamorphosised my taste in back music . trust me , you 'll never go back to commercial r&b again
dvd pos 426.txt i do not consider it hyperbole to talk about the second season of " buffy the vampire slayer " as scaling operatic heights , culminating with the glorious aria of " becoming , part 2 , " which i still relentlesly tout as one of the ten best dramatic hours on television i have ever seen in my life . i have watched a lot of television and have been teaching classes about this topic for over half my life , so i believe i can make a pretty convincing case . we witnesses the potential of this series in season 1 , when creator joss whedon held off on the revelation that the mysterious angel was really a vampire , who just happened to have a soul and loved the slayer , until half way through the abbreviated first season . in season 2 , we find out just how far true love can go wrong . love continues to be a very painful thing for the scooby gang , as cordelia ( " some assembly required " ) , xander ( " inca mummy girl " ) and joyce ( " ted " ) , find out . then again , prospects look much better for willow ( " phases " ) , although we never really do take the cordelia-xander romance ( " go fish " ) to be anything more than a cosmic joke , which does offer up the delightfully twisted " bewitched , bothered , and bewildered " as the exception that proves the rule ( footnote : buffy spends most of the episode as the buffy rat because sarah michelle gellar was hosting snl that week ) . of the off-arc stories , " halloween " and " ted " are clearly the best of the bunch . but when it comes to romance , buffy and angel are truly on the road to hell paved with the best of intentions . it is clear in the season premier episode , " when she was bad , " that things are different . when buffy dances seductively with xander , taunting him with her sexuality , the ante has been upped considerably . the pivotal point in the season comes with episode 13 ( of 22 ) , " surprise , " when buffy unknowingly undoes angel 's curse on the night of her 17th birthday by making love to him . why the gypsies put in the faustian ( in the goethe sense ) escape clause via the moment of true happiness and contentment is debatable , but the galvanizing effect on the show is truly impressive . when angelus brutally slays jenny calendar in " passion , " leaving her body in a grotesque display for giles to discover in his bed ( while opera music soars in the background ) , it is the symbolic hellmouth of the show opening up . the audience is shocked into realizing how bad things can get , only the worst is yet to come . giles 's anger buys him one shot at angelus , but buffy has to rescue him . they turn on each other in anger , and buffy actually slugs him to the ground before they collapse weeping in each other 's arms . buffy tells him , " i ca n't do this alone , " but this proves to be most ironically incorrect . clearly whedon constructs each season around two half-season story arcs . the first half of season 2 heralds the arrival of spike and dru , and the quick departure of " the annoying one . " of course now we look back and are amazed at what james marsters has done with the role of spike , but at this point it is juliet landau 's ditzy psychotic vampire who provides the flair of the dark side . whedon brings the first half to a climax in " what 's my line ? , " the show 's first two-parter , where we are introduced to kendra the vampire slayer . it seems buffy 's brief moment of death at the hands of the master in " prophecy girl " has some long reaching implications we only begin to appreciate at this point . but with the return of angelus everything changes . spike and drusilla are trying to reassemble the judge , a grotesque who cannot be killed " by any weapon forged . " then everybody learns the truth about not only angel 's transformation but also jenny 's betrayal . thus begins the deadly game of cat and mouse between angel and his former allies , which culminates in the two parts of " becoming . " both parts of " becoming " are written and directed by whedon , and represent the apex of his work on the series . when angeleus opens the portal to hell , only his blood can close it , but things are not going to be that easy for buffy . the dramatic culmination contains the best fight sequence ( with swords ) in a show that prides itself on innovative staging of its fights , and is an ultimately emotionally shattering experience captured beautifully by sarah michelle gellar 's slow dissolve into tears while the haunting sarah mclachlan song " full of grace " is played . joss whedon had set this moment up from the first episode of the series . it is a payoff usually reserved for the final episode of a series and not simply the end of the second season . " becoming " is truly an astounding accomplishment in the history of dramatic television and when you watch the entire second season again you can appreciate how brilliantly this shattering conclusion is set up . the original theatrical film was a teaser , the first season on television was an appetizer , but the second season of " buffy the vampire slayer " was epic and once you see this , whether again or for the first time , you are not going to want to stop here . it was also nice to see that the extras went up a couple of notches for the season 2 dvd collection , especially since we expect more goodies from whedon and crew , especially given the high quality of " the watchers guide , " the show 's official companion volumes . there was a lot of thought put into this show , which means any and all insights and looks behind the curtain are greatly appreciated
camera pos 374.txt the philips digital frame truly stands out from all other digital pictures frames that i 've gotten . the resolution and picture quality superb , and the sleek outer design is an additional plus . also , the picture frame can be charged and last a couple of hours without a cord , which is very convenient . as another reviewer said , you have to scroll through your entire collection one-by-one on your memory card in order for you to get to the picture you want . it would be more convenient if you could skip through pages or have a blackberry type rolling scroll on the side of the frame to speed through if you needed to . also , i would like to see philips next frame include a flashdrive slot as well , that way we can upload pictures from our computers to the usb flash drive and directly insert the flash drive into the frame without tranferring them onto a memory card . thank you

camera pos 146.txt this camera is amazing . out of the 3 digital camera 's under $150 i 've used , this is by far the best , beating out the kodak and the sipix . i originally bought the sipix , and it was junk . do n't buy the sipix that 's under $150. the kodak for some reason did n't seem like it took as good pictures as the finepix , but the software was a little better , being from kodak . this camera can take pictures of resolution up to 2 megapixels , but i do n't even use that option because the 1 megapixel pictures are so amazing . it comes with a 16mb removable memory card , so you can take around 49 pics at 1mp , around 24 at 2mp , and it takes short videos for about 30 seconds in mpeg format at a 320 x 160 resolution , or more on a lower setting . the lcd screen can easily be turned on or off to save battery power , and the 2 aa batteries it takes lasts pretty long . it has a nice , sleak design , and the software has no issues with windows xp at least . the only cons i could think of are that the only zoom it has is 2x digital zoom , which is pretty much useless , and i never use it , since it 's the same thing as zooming in with your picture viewer on your computer . so you can consider it not having any zoom . the software for it works well , but it could be better , options wise . the filenames of the pictures will default to a number depending on its order on the memory card , so if you transfer pics to your computer more than once in a day ( since it creates folders based on date ) , you 'll have to rename each pic . but i hardly complain , since the pictures come out so incredibly well . i 'm so happy with this camera ! if you want a camera under $150 , this is the one to get . do n't even waste your time with the kodak , unless you want the one with 3x optical zoom , but that 's $200. i use it for general purpose , taking pictures of freinds and such . once in a while i take a picture of a sunset at 2mp , and that will be photo quality printed on a full page . 1mp creates crisp and clear desktop wallpaper size images , and .3mp will created good smaller images to put on websites . there 's no reason to buy anything else , go with the fuji finepix a200 !
camera pos 224.txt i use this gem on my 20d along with my 24-105mm , and as far as i 'm concerned it is one of the best optical lenses out there . my 24-105 is n't the ideal indoor / low light lens nor is it the ideal sports photography lens ( although it is sharp , just not quite long enough ) the 70-200 fills in that gap in my arsenal with is to boot ! the photos i 've taken so far on the sidelines are all keepers . if you can afford it , do it , you wo n't regret i
dvd pos 417.txt this review refers to " excalibur " ( dvd-region 2 ) in days of old , with knights so bold , and fair maidens glittering all in gold , lays the legend of king arthur , camelot , and the powerful , mystical sword known as " excalibur " . john boorman 's beautiful artistic film ( adopted from sir arthur mallory 's " le morte d'arthur " ) , will captivate you and take you away to another time and place . from the birth of arthur , merlin taking him away for 20 years , arthur drawing " excalibur " from the stone , the emergence of camelot , the magical powers of merlin and the evil morgana , to arthur 's demise and being taken off to avalon , the beauty of this film and this story will have you under a spell . the european cast and the exquisite location shoots in the country side of ireland add a sense of authenticity to the flavor of this film . king arthur , the knights of the round table , sir lancelot , guinevere , merlin , morgana , sir gawain , percival , uther , they 're all very much part of the story , and the cast is tremendous . nigel terry is the good and noble king arthur , lancelot and guinevere , who loved their king but also each other are played by nicholas clay and cherie lunghi . you 'll see stellar performances by a young gabriel bryne ( in his first feature film ) , patrick stewart , and liam neeson . helen mirren is excellent as the evil morgana , and the always wonderful nicol williamson is the magical mystical merlin this edition is for viewers with dvd players compatible with region 2 ( japan , europe , south africa , and the middle east , including egypt ) .some players are multi-regional , so check your manual . parents...although a wonderful tale of knights and fair ladies , this is not one for younger viewers . the battle scenes are violent and a bit graphic and there are also some sexual situations . " first knight " with richard gere and sean connery , although not quite as true to the legend , is rated pg-13 , is quite an entertaining film , and may be more suitable for family viewing ( there is some violence ) . a beautiful story and film . enjoy....lauri
software pos 844.txt this remote works really well and it 's easy to create your own profiles for whatever application you use , or to customize it however you want . there is a good user community that is doing a lot of cool things with the firefly . set up is simple and the range is good . it " just works . " the only suggestion is that the buttons are not backlit so it 's hard to use in the dark . adding to that problem is that the remote is pretty much symmetrical so you can be holding it upside down and not really realize it . if it were n't for that i 'd give it five stars , and if they came out with a version that had backlit buttons i would n't hesitate to upgrade

software pos 285.txt not sure how i got it , but i got a browser hijacker that adaware and spybot would n't get rid of . on top of that i got a trojan that these programs and my avast antivirus would n't get rid of . so out of desperation to do something quickly , i went to b.buy and bought this for $40. they did n't have a large selection , so i put down the money for it . imagine my feeling when i saw it on amazon for $20. still this product works well . it made me uninstall spybot , adaware , and turn off my windows firewall to install it . you can install it on 3 different computers , or it asked you to switch your license from one of them , should you install it a fourth time . so you can install it more than 3 times , you jsut have to switch your lisenses..understand ? product works very well and got rid of my problems . you get updates for 1 year , and then you have to renew . i think this is stupid personally , but its the trend now days . its a rip...you pay $40 for spyware or virus protection and it should be good for more than a year . several annoying windows pop up from time to time asking me what i want it to do . i wish there was some default user setting so the program could do it . the firewall slows down your connection , but they all do . i have 3mg dsl and my speed test are down around 1300k , so i 've lost alot of bandwith . i guess its worth the protection . before with spybot and adaware , the spyscans would typically find 25+ issues of spyware . now with trend micro , i find only 5 to 10 issues on my weekely scan . so i 'm happy with the product , except for my decrease in dsl speed
software pos 624.txt excellent software to manage your large backup hard drives . you can format , partition , split , merge and a whole lot of other things . if you purchase a large backup hard drive i recommend this software and the acronis true image software . with both , you can partition your drive and have a ghost copy of your c: \ drive in one partition and daily backups of my documents in another . this way in case of a hd crash you have a bootable backup . ( note that the software that comes with backup hard drives will not make a bootable backup of your hard drive . ) thats why i recommend both acronis software packages
health neg 882.txt i am a big fan of the regular clic reading glasses . i own several pairs and think they are great . however , the sport goggles do not get my vote of confidence . they have three problems which make them unusable for me : 1 ) on all clic products there is an all important stem adjustment that adjusts the length of the stems to properly fit the glasses onto your head . however , unlike the very cool regular reading glasses by clic , the sport googles do not adjust properly and so the goggles run very tight if you need even a slightly above average stem legnth , 2 ) there is also extra foam padding on the sport googles that make them very snug , but because of the tight stems the foam padding makes these glasses far too tight to enjoy and 3 ) the maker does n't make it as clear as they should in their description ... the irridium ( red ) colored lens on some of the sports goggles are far too intensely tinted and dark for any kind of regular light conditions or applications like morning driving ... or even safe walking on a rocky path . sorry clic , but your success with the reading glasses went to your head ... you needed to do more user testing for comfort and vision with the sports goggles . i would like to return them for a larger size and lighter colored lens ... too bad for me !

camera pos 284.txt i 've had this lens for 2 months now , and love it . it was my first " l " lens and i can see the quality difference in this line . first , i tried the 28-135 is-pretty good . but i was n't totally happy , so returned it and ordered the 24-105 l . now i 'm happy . contrast , sharpness , & ca are much better . build quality & feel are superior as well . plus the is really works . i will try & get all is lens in the future , i believe it is worth the extra cost . focusing is very quick and zoom action is smooth & steady . if you 're on a budget , the 28-135 is real nice . but to go all the way , i recommend this lens . the is on the 24-105 l is quieter i found . the price is a bit steep , but optical quality is there , resale value will remain good , and weather sealing should hopefully keep dust and junk from getting inside this lens .
books neg 220.txt if you liked whyte 's previous sophomoric efforts , you 'll love this . in addition to being the same dumb , hackneyed story lines and stock characters we are used to from the previous books , this one has the additional feeling of being pure filler : in no real way does the story get advanced . arthur begins as a baby , and ends as a small boy . there are adventures , but nothing important happens . as usual , in whyte 's books , the bad guys are left alive so they can sneak up and do new evil , and as usual the bad guys are pure plot devices and in no way characters . with all the ( totally ahistorical ) democratic rhetoric , merlin 's brother shows up out of nowhere and they immediately hand him half the power in camelot . anyone who would read this , i guess , has already read the previous lame offerings in this series and does n't object to laughably boring plots which rely heavily on coincidence , caricatures who never grow or change , and historical detail that sounds like it comes from a museum brochure rather than any real scholarship . so go for it . but please , if you want something exciting that will also make you think , look at the really good arthurian efforts out there- -gillian brandshaw , a.a. attanasio , or barbara taylor bradford to name just a very few. .

books neg 174.txt this is a nearly verbatim rendition of the grimms ' story , and it 's hard to understand why zelinsky would use his talent to illustrate it for children . even harder to figure out is how the american library association could award its caldecott medal for distinguished american picture book for children to any rendition of this dreadful tale : the king threatens to kill the miller 's daughter if she ca n't spin gold from straw . rumpelstiltskin saves her life by spinning gold for her , but extracts a necklace , a ring and , on the third night of spinning , a promise of her firstborn . she then marries the king , whom zelinsky depicts as young and handsome . when it comes time for the queen to hand over her newborn , rumpel agrees to relent if the queen can discover his name . she sends a servant to follow him into the woods and discover the name . so the king , though he looks good , is greedy and brutal . the queen is a victim who agrees to give over a future infant to save her own life , and then depends on an anonymous , unrecognized " servant girl " to save the child . and rumpelstiltskin , shown as physically unattractive and ( the message seems to be ) therefore bad , is the one who saved the future queen from execution and then relents on the payment he bargained for . a weird , twisted story that offers nothing for kids , illustrated with renaissance-style pictures that accentuate the perversity by making the bad guy look good and the guy who saved the damsel in distress look bad

dvd pos 203.txt i saw this movie in the 1986 theatrical re-release and subsequently on dvd . i can readily attest that it does not age ! i 'm not even a dog person myself , but the plot is not about dogs per say , but the life adventures that a young cocker spaniel named lady has . living with owners named darling and jim dear , lady apparently leads a pretty good life . assuming that every dog leads the good life she and her friends enjoy , she is later shocked to meet tramp , who lives on the streets . however , she soon realizes that he has a good heart beneath that rough exterior . she needs his help when crusty old aunt sarah comes to mind the house- -and the newborn baby . initially not understanding that lady feels protective towards the baby , she also selectively ignores the damage which her two siamese cats were actually responsible for doing to that very elaborate victorian house . amazingly , aunt sarah presumes that lady was responsible for wrecking the house- -and attempts to muzzle her up ! like any streetwise character , tramp has lots of connections and solutions to any problem which pops up . however , he does not come across as an annoying know-it-all who you would want to quickly get rid of . tramp is instead somebody whom we are supposed to both identify and then want to hang out with in rough environments . lady had ' gentle ' friends named jock and trusty , but they ca n't help out in a world also outside of their own . of course , the spaghetti dinner scene remains one of the most enduring of all time- -it made a very profound impact on me well before i was even old enough to myself consider dating . i imagined that i would eventually share a romantic dinner of my own with my own " mr. right " . however , tramp 's decision to go after the rat in the nursery also remains a powerful scene . he then felt no loyalty to anybody in that family other than lady , but saved the baby anyway ! tramp proved that class is not a matter of breeding but what you do with your self ! despite his earlier professed discomfort with collars , tramp ultimately gets adopted by the darlings . therefore , he and lady do in fact live happily ever after .

" ah , well , let me explain . see , if tchikavoslky taught me one thought , it was this : i know nothing . so it is with this deep insight into my own mind that i came up with the following things i should know , based on what i currently do not know : 1. how to start a hurricane . this is very important . 2. how to kill a man with a toothpick . what if you met a hitman at a fancy restaurant and found out your were his next victim ? scary . 3. how to run a nuclear powerplant with a one-man army . i do n't want to be the next homer simpson ! 4. how to raise children . i 've raised ten and still have n't figured out what a diaper is . 5. what a diaper is . i do n't know , my wife used to talk about them a lot . 6. how to drive . sure , technically we 're supposed to learn how before we get our driver 's licenses , but like many people , i just got a fake one when i was 12 and have been driving since then . i 've been in over three hundred vehicular accidents and been charged with five counts of manslaughter , so i figured it might be good to learn how to drive . 7. how to stalk a celebrity . you just never know . 8. how to put on underwear without leaving stain marks . you fellas know what i 'm saying ! 9. how to make coffee . people ask me to all the time , and because i do n't know how , i just take some warm water and pour mud in . thankfully no one 's noticed my inadequacies yet , but i 'm sure soon enough they will , after another person dies of food poisoning and internal infection . 10. how to kill yourself . i do n't want the aliens to get anything out of me when i 'm taken hostage . i saw it in that tom cruise movie , and it was sure scary ! so with these things in mind , i 'm severely disappointed by this book , and feel it is mis-marketed and stupid . please , barbet schroeder ( or whoever the author was ) , write a better book next time
health pos 837.txt my husband was totally delighted with the rollator walker . it is so much easier to use than the typical walker that we had to wonder why anyone would n't want this new , much more attractive kind . it folds up very easily when not in use and the basket comes in very handy for carrying things . when folded up it fits in the back seat of our car , and it would probably fit in the trunk if your truck is fairly large . we put it together in about 5 minutes and the price was great , what more can you ask

camera neg 457.txt it 's unfortunate that with a name like canon , you expect a quality camera . that 's why you shell out the money for an item that you think canon will stand behind . unfortunately , this is not the case . i bought this camera to use in graduate school ( industrial design ) . i needed it to do research for my thesis . i figured between that , all the product photographs , and the need good portfolio pieces , spending the 500.00 on an 8mp camera would be well worth the investment . i was wrong . about a month after i bought the camera , it started to malfunction . the lens got stuck and would not come out . neither would it go all the way back in , so the lens cover would not close ( not only putting the lens in danger , but draining the battery as well . ) it was still under warranty , so i sent it to the canon service center in elk grove village , illinois . it was received , and i was informed that my camera would be returned in 7-10 business days . that was almost a month and a half ago . i have put my thesis research on hold because i do not have the proper camera for it . every time i call the service center , i am told that the " parts are on back order " . evidently they do n't know when these shipments are due in their center , so they do n't know when i will have my camera back . the best part is , when i called two weeks ago , they offered me a " brand new " s215. the told me it was a great deal and that i should accept the offer because " they never do that " ( meaning they never offer a new camera for one in repair . ) i pointed out that the s215 was only 5mp , had a smaller screen , and cost nearly 300.00 less than my camera . i also reminded her that my camera was brand new when it broke and i had to send it in . today i was told that there was no information on my camera , the backordered parts , or when they could send my camera back . the woman on the phone asked me why i did n't accept the s215 that was offered , and when i explained and asked for a camera the same model as mine , she said they were not authorized to do that . i told her that i was going to spend the time originally set aside for my thesis research to write letters to both the service center and canon corporate headquarters , and she suddenly had a technician she could consult , and my camera would be back to me by the end of the week . i wo n't hold my breath , but a copy of this review will be sent to canon .

software neg 126.txt i really dislike this software . i 'm the type that likes to customize everything and this program just is not made that way . first , when you initially select files and folders , your disk choices are " c : " or " all " . i have several disks and i want to pick and choose , but this program makes that really difficult . then you have to pick a destination where the files will be backed up . choose carefully , because you wo n't be allowed to change it later ! and if you want to do incremental backups , be sure to schedule it before you do the initial save , because you ca n't do it later . basically the entire job , future backups and all , must be defined completly at the beginning and can never be changed without completely starting over .

software neg 14.txt i use pdfs a lot and i must say that quite often i turn to free pdf software to actually do the tasks that acrobat fails to do . one area i have always had a problem with is the formatting of some documents in size and sometimes acrobat simply fails to recognize them and so i switch to the free pdf software which has no problems doing this and is easier to use . however if you are a pro pdf maker who wants to add sigs and links and notes and chapters and all the other function tags including security tags then i recommend this product hands down as the best one . i just find that it is not always the best pdf software package in the world , but a good one all the same . i would not recommend buying this one just to make standard pdf files alone . if you want to touch up those file then this is what you need to do that right .
books neg 187.txt i did n't like the only other dean koontz book i 've ever read , watchers , but i enjoy reading kevin anderson 's stuff so i thought i 'd give koontz another try because i 'm a reasonable person and i understand that not everyone can like everything by an author . on to the review : i realize that this book was initially meant to be a screenplay but i think the authors would have been wise to rewrite it instead of just tweaking it a little when the movie deal fell through . the dialog is mind-numbing and predictable . every time there was a car scene i could guess what kind of conversation would be held . " you drive too fast ! " " are you my mother ? " over and over and over . the idea was good . a modern-day frankenstein . . . or rather a frankenstein that had never died and had made it to present day ( yes , i know , frankenstein was the doctor , not his monster . but you get what i 'm saying . ) . but the dialog read exactly like a movie script would , or like a play . this book had so much potential but the authors ' laziness in not rewriting the entire thing after the movie was n't made cost it dearly

dvd pos 106.txt before i rate the box set and the four movies i would like to give you a brief history of my life with these films . when i was really young i use to always ask my dad to rent tremors and we would all set and whatch it . but when i got a bit older and i could understand things better i became afraid and was scared of grabiods coming up from underneath are house and eating me . anyways after about two years i got the guts to whatch tremors 2 : after shocks . and afterwards i was agian afraid of grabiods and now shriekers attacking me . finally after about ten years of not watching them , me and my buddy travis got to talking about tremors and he asked me what grabiods where . so i dicided to draw him pictures of them and after a few days i ended up creating a tremors comic . so after becoming so involved with tremors again i decided to watch the first film again . and after it ended , i bought it off amazon and a week later i bought the third movie and then another week after that i bought the second . i had literly gone a 180 from fearing tremors so long ago to become a huge fan . and when the fourth finally came out i had my family , my friend travis and his brother hooked . now after being a huge fan and watching the four films over and over i can finally rate them . the original tremors is by far the best ; with it 's all star cast and great story line . the second best would have to be tremors 4 : the legend begins because it stays more true to the first and it shows how it all began . tremors 2 : after shocks would be third best since it stared earl and gummer and tremors 3 : back to prefection would have to be the worst since it 's story is weak , its short and it takes the evolution thing a bit far . overall this is a great pack of all four tremors movies and if i had n't boughten all of them aready i would buy this attack pack . ps. tremors 5 script has been finished and if tremors 4 sales enough they will make a fifth . and one more thing it would be awsome if universal would release tremors : the series on dvd .

software pos 911.txt i bought this based on the amazon reviews . i am extremely new at this but the software is pretty good . the teacher is somewhat annoying and as another reviewer said , he sings over his playing way too much . i wish there was a way to turn him way down and the guitar up . it touts having over 160 lessons , but that is somewhat misleading . i do n't doubt it has over 160 pages , but i covered 23 " lessons " in about an hour . i do like the fact that the first few lessons he teaches you very easy versions of the chords so you do n't feel hung up on doing the full chords when your fingers do n't want to move to strange new positions they are n't used to . i am using this as well as fender 's dvd for acoustic with keith wyatt . the dvd is a little more challenging for me , but keith wyatt is much better than the guy from the emedia software ( and he does n't feel the need to sing ! ! ! ) . overall , i would recommend this software

books neg 205.txt if you are looking for a " feel good " book about baby boomer retirement , this book may have some value for you . but if you are looking for specific in-depth how-to , this book is n't the answer . each segment-work , dreams , travel-is short and does n't address many relevant issues . for example , regarding the work chapter , the author postulates that there will be a work shortage and companies will hire baby boomers to fill the gap . well , that is speculative with globalism . those jobs may be outsourced . most are low paying . many of my highly qualified friends are unable to find jobs despite retraining . yes , there may be wal-mart jobs but is this your retirement dream ? the work chapter sounds a lot like most " do what you love " books . but doing what you love is often best as a hobby not to furnish needed income . these and other issues facing boomers who want meaningful work into their 70s are not addressed . i could pick apart other chapters in the same manner
music neg 786.txt for those who were fortunate enough to aquire one of the first two releases of the thief soundtrack ( like myself ) congratulations - you have the version of the cd that contains the best song on the soundtrack , beach scene . it has been dropped for this us release . for those who were interested in obtaining the thief soundtrack being mainly interested in the one song , beach scene ( most of the other songs can be found on other tangerine dream albums ) , please realise the following differences between beach theme and the now dropped , beach scene . the song , beach theme is a much shorter track ( almost by half ) and there is a very cheesy , acoustic , " rock n ' roll " , drum beat that was mixed / dubbed over the original beach scene song which has the much more mellow and less invasive electronic , sequenced drum beat in it . it 's beach scene that was both heard in the movie and over the airwaves back in 1981. if that is the song you remember ( fell in love with ) and are looking for , do not buy this latest release . keep looking for those out of print cds - they are out there . on a lighter " note " , it 's very nice to see they added the ending / end-credits song , confrontation . this is a lose / win scenario for thief soundtrack fans - it all depends on which song is more important to you . if you already have the earlier releases with beach scene on it then buying this latest version will now complete a defninitve soundtrack for them as that last song in the movie has now finally been added to the official soundtrack

" ann carrington ( carole landis ) is returning to her ancestral home and inheritance , with cheeky pal gail ( joan blondell ) in tow . but after the girls switch bedrooms , someone murders gail . confused , she drifts over to the house of cosmo topper ( roland young ) , whose car she hijacked earlier in the day . gail blackmails topper into helping her discover who murdered her , and who is trying to kill ann. now the unfortunate topper must somehow solve the mystery , despite a small army of creepy servants , a house full of secret passages and vicious seals , and his upset wife searching high and low for him.. . based on thorne smith 's novels , " topper " and " topper returns " even had a spinoff tv series , which was nowhere near as good as the movies . and those movies are charming and still fresh , especially if you like to see a twist on the usual ghost stories . but it 's the little touches that make this movie hilarious ; for example , there 's george laughing on a chandelier , and gail chugging champagne when she discovers her own dead body . not to mention that vicious seal . the comedy becomes more obvious and spoofy in the second film , but no less entertaining . but at the same time , these movies are graced by tender moments between george and marion , and a truly exquisite scene where gail 's ghost wanders out the window into the sky . and i 'm still not sure how that invisible-person-under-the-covers shot was done , especially with the primitive special effects of the 1940s . roland young is the star of the piece - - his topper is timid , halting , and has his day scheduled down to the minute . not a single spark of sponteneity . grant comes across like a trickster god , and has wonderful chemistry with bennett . and blondell is simply charming as a resourcefully cheeky ghost girl . " topper " and " topper returns " are decades old , but are perfect examples of hollywood classics . charming , chipper and hilarious
camera pos 97.txt when digital cameras first came out , i , like many people swore i 'd always be loyal to film . digital could never take the place of film . i 'm not convinced that it has replaced film completely . there 's still something i love about putting a roll of film in the camera , shooting away , sending the film to be processed , and seeing the results . i also know it 's a bit expensive . i know that the argument about quality has always been paramount in the discussion , but digital cameras are improving in this regard , and most manufacturers are assuring users that while the technology will always be improving , we are at a point where a good investment can be made in a digital slr and it will not be outdated as soon as the buyer purchases the camera . so i figured now is the time to get a digital slr . i have been a loyal nikon user for nearly ten years , and have owned the nikon n60 , n70 , and n80. my first love was , and still is the n70 ( i 've been told by the person who sold me the camera he thought i was the only person who loved the n70 ) . i purchased the n80 only after my n70 cost too much to repair , but i 've enjoyed the way my various nikon cameras have handled all sorts of situations and the fact that they can be as simple to use as a point and shoot if i do n't have the time to use specific controls , but it also has options for more creative and artistic purposes . my nikon cameras have allowed me to capture family moments with ease and majestic landscapes , wildlife shots and all sorts of other things i ca n't resist to capture forever . i decided to purchase the d70 since it was close to what i 've already experienced with nikon . in many ways it works in a similar way to the n70 and 80 , except it 's a digital rather than film version . like the film versions of the midrange nikon slr 's , it has a dial that allows an automatic setting , portrait , landscape , sports , close-up , nightscape , and night portrait modes , the ability to select aperture , shutter speed or manual controls . the camera has auto and manual focus abilities . photos can be as easy or technical as the photographer desires . the controls are easy to use , though it takes practice to be comfortable . on a personal level , the camera has passed the halloween test , niece 's birthday test , and fall foliage in new england test and favorite scenic spots test . the only real difficulty i 've had with the camera is trying to capture stained glass windows in a dark setting . auto focus has not worked at all and i 'm not thrilled with the manual focus of these shots , but at this point i 'm sure it 's the photographer and not the camera . i do have one suggestion for anyone who purchases this camera . the manual is very confusing . it uses all sorts of symbols and can be more of a distraction than anything else . i 've had luck with the " magic lantern guides " with my other cameras , but have not as of yet used it for this camera . i did purchase the nikon d70 field guide ( david busch , wiley publishing ) which has been helpful . it can be a quick reference for anyone already familiar with nikon and photography in general but it also provides and introduction for the novice to photography .
dvd pos 31.txt the station agent is a touching , yet off the beaten path kind of flick that i found simply endearing to watch . fin ( peter dinklage ) has just inherited a train depot somewhere out in new jersey . having a passion for trains , he embraces this as his home . however , he only wishes to be left alone and finds that 's not as easy to do as he would have thought . first , he discovers joe ( bobby cannavale ) who has set up a food truck outside his home . joe is a conversationalist , desperate to talk to anyone and everyone . next fin meets olivia ( patricia clarkson ) , who almost runs him off the road , twice . these three appear to have nothing in common , and despite all odds , they form a friendship that is heartwarming to see . all three actors gave amazing performances . dinklage , as always , commands every scene he is in . i 've missed seeing him since the bastards at cbs quashed threshold , so it was nice to see something with him in it again . cannavale amused me with his character , joe , who really needed to " get a life . " the idea of quite time is not something he can easily grasp to say the least . and clarkson radiated as olivia , a character trying to put her life back together again after having lost her son and having her husband leave her . what i liked most about this flick is the honest portrayal it gave us of life through fin 's eyes . there were the chronic stares he got just for being smaller than average . plus , there was a scene in the grocery store where the cashier did n't even see that he was standing there , so she did n't ring him up until he could get her attention . it just made me think about what it must really be like to not fit in the standard mold physically . all in all , excellent film

dvd neg 762.txt yup , definately the worst halloween movie . come on , michael on a reality show ? ha ! what the f**k does that have to do with the series ? not only that , but the plot is completely pointless , the acting sucks , and dr. loomis and jamie are nowhere to be found in the movie ! not only that , but the movie relies way too much on gore to be scary , and therefore comes off as pretentious . do n't get me wrong , i love gore in movies , horror or not , but any knowledgable halloween fan knows that the halloween movies were always scary without the gore . along with halloween 3 ( which actually had nothing to do with michael ) , halloween : resurrection reigns as the worst movie of the series . there are a many more problems with the movie than the ones i listed , but i 'm tired of typing , so i 'll let other reviewers explain why it 's so bad . bottom line , watch any halloween movie other than this or halloween 3
dvd pos 368.txt the is a tragic but very true to life depiction of the degradation caused by addiction to individuals , families , and society . the film is graphic in its depiction of addiction , but as an addiction counselor , who is an addict and alcoholic in recovery , it is very close to actual tragic events i have seen in the world of addiction . the emotionally disturbing events that take place in the lives of the main characters are exactly the very real things that addiction counselors are seeking to prevent . these events are the end of untreated or unchecked addiction for far too many . unfortunately , even though some of the content may be offensive to some , it is a starkly true depiction of what the reality for some addicts becomes . even though the film may leave one emotionally upset for a time , it is a worthwhile film to break through false pretenses about addiction 's final results and the glossing over of the degradation addiction can and does lead to in real life . watch and learn the truth about severe addiction
books neg 984.txt i typically do not read stories like this , but a neighbor had lent it to me and i figured i 'd check it out . the plot is n't bad , but the dialogue is another story . the writing was so unbelievably awful that i had to fight myself to finish it . phrases like " god damn , oh god , etc.. . " were repeated over and over again . i got really sick hearing about tess 's cute freckles and jimmy 's movie star looks / sex drive . the majority of the story line between tess and jimmy has them arguing over a one night stand . it was 300 + pages of pretty bad writing . i 'd strongly recommend taking a pass on this book . not worth your time unless you are looking to take a mini-break from harlequin romances.. .
software pos 164.txt nobody , and i mean nobody , could be more of an illustrator novice & ignoramus than i . several months ago i was given a licensed copy of illustrator 9 that a departing coworker had used . wanting a chance to design the departmental logo that otherwise would 've gone to an agency , i raised my figurative hand and volunteered blindly for duty . having taught myself everything from ms-dos to turbocad , to photoshop elements , not to mention word , excel , and powerpoint ( do n't get me started on that latter program , argh ) , i figured i could tackle at least the basics of illustrator 9. loaded it on my laptop , took it home for a weekend....and just about lost my sanity - - and several fingernails - - trying to learn that confounding program . i managed to produce a few logos , one of which was chosen . but egads , what a big , stinky bear illustrator 9 was to wrestle . when i saw that cs2 had this live trace feature , i pleaded with my workplace santa to get it for me , and wow ! what an overall improvement ! ! illustrator will still not be as intuitive to pick up as an ms office product , but this comes darn close . with cs2 , they 've given us " hot tips " - - little clues about what some of the tools do , that pop up when you mouse over the tool . the intuitive menus are nice too . also cool is that all the text & paragraph and fill & stroke features , which used to be huge boxes taking up valuable real estate on the screen , are now condensed up on a small horizontal toolbar , like in the office products ... and when you mouse over them , the screen tips tell you how to expand them . aaaahh ! finally some help for dunces like me . live trace and live paint are unbelieveably cool . the very first thing i did after loading cs2 was to grab a .jpg photo of a soccer ball off google images , and within 20 minutes , without consulting any book or online help , i 'd converted it into a simple graphic image painted into the 2 colors i wanted . but as for a great guidebook , the reviewer who suggested illustrator visual quickstart guide by elaine weinmann was dead-on . i 've bought several other " highly rated " books to try to help me through the confounding quagmire of adobe products , so i 've seen them all . the visual quickstart book does n't have any of that insufferable " wanna-be-a-comic-novel-author " writing , and focuses just on the basics . and it 's very literal , with step-by-step instructions . still there 's no substitute for the utterly excruciating process of learning illustrator through experience . but the weinmann book 's better than any i 've seen yet . the only reason i have n't given this product a 5 is because it still does n't have the intuitiveness that it needs . in that way it 's still " snobby " - - aimed at pros , not folks like me who need to do occasional design stuff but not for a living . but this is a far , far , far cry better than illustrator 9. absolutely worth the money , just for live trace and live paint alone .

music pos 18.txt this has to be one of the most beautiful cds ever recorded . damien 's vocal range is vast ; his musicianship excellent ; but it 's the crafting of songs at which he truly surpasses most artists . haunting , sensitive , flowing , crashing.. .

music neg 473.txt unfortunately i was extremely unhappy after listening to the album . unlike many other altan fans , i view maireads singing as the weakest part of the groups appeal despite their having chosen some excellent songs over the course of their recording career . the problem is that on this album they emphasize her singing to the almost total exclusion of their instrumentals which was what attracted me to the group in the first place . and the few instrumentals they do play are played with no spirit almost like & quot ; well i guess we have to put a few instrumentals on&quot ; kind of effort . i 'm sorry , but she has a thin voice and is frequently shrill and off-key on many of their songs . she is however an excellent fiddler and that with the superb abilities of the other members and inspired arrangements made them for me the top irish folk group . alas they have decided to stress her poor-to-mediocre vocals instead of their great abilities in playing reels , jigs , etc. i miss frankie kennedy 's flute too . goodbye altan , your best day 's are over unless you revert to the format of the old days

dvd pos 4.txt at 23 years of age , i can truly say that i have been a lifetime fan of sesame street . watching the 3-dvd set of sesame street - old school , vol . 1 has been both nostalgic and enlightening . because i was born practically a decade after most of the material on this set originally aired , i expected most of the content to be new to me ( i was barely a year old when mr. hooper 's death was explained to the world ) , but that was not the case . many of the short films and interstitials were familiar ( and not just because i used to watch sesame unpaved on noggin ) to me as a viewer from the mid-1980s , and i think that just underscores the quality the show has exhibited from the beginning . sesame street truly revolutionized children 's programming , not just because it was educational , but because it was ( and remains ) entertaining , not pandering . i 'll admit , seeing gordon with an afro , orange oscar and the first few tries at big bird 's head still freak me out a bit ( as they did when i saw them on noggin several years back ) , but the show itself is just as good as i ever remembered , something that cannot be said for most nostalgia entertainment ( like transformers or he-man or jem ) . the set contains five full episodes from the first five seasons , and 54 ( the liner notes are incorrect , they should have asked count for help ) bonus clips . the set also includes the 25 minute pitch-film that was made before the series originally aired , explaining sesame street 's message and motive . although the episodes have a disclaimer that it is not necessarily intended for today 's pre-school children , i believe they would probably enjoy " classic " street even more than the current lineup of shows . the fact that today 's pre-schoolers may be more advanced than the sesame street of yore can really be attributed to sesame street itself , and that 's pretty cool . still , i personally appreciate that the aim of the set is at adults , because so many of us associate our childhood with sesame street . a booklet is included that gives a brief overview of the series from the first five years and i found it informative . according to muppet central , a few sketches were altered or removed for music copyright issues ( one with stevie wonder , one with rogers & hammerstein ) , but because i never saw the originals , i found nothing amiss . what astounded me more than anything was that at the end of the first five years , more than 600 episodes of the show had been produced . no wonder they ca n't release full seasons ! although the full-length episodes are great , my favorite part are the additional sketches from each respective season . seeing kermit sing " bein ' green " in its original form , the " bread , milk and butter " cartoon and the " in in the sky with diamonds " parody is a real treat . the picture quality is great - - especially considering the program 's age ( and the fact that it was one of the first programs to be recorded on video , although film was used for most of the interstitials ) - - i doubt the show ever looked as good as it looks right now . the sound quality is good too - - mono of course - - but clear and crisp . overall , i highly recommend this set for anyone who loves or loved sesame street . for those who were born after these episodes aired ( like me ) , looking back at the beginning is really special . it is clear that everyone involved had a true love for teaching and interacting with children and taking television to another level

dvd pos 575.txt for ina claire ninotchka was a last chance to show posterity what she could do , for there would n't be many film opportunities offered her . she 'd been a leading lady of the stage for nigh on thirty years , and her elegant beauty , very much a high-bred dina merrill type look , was still aglow . she was one of carl van vechten 's favorite subjects and he took photo after photo of her , staring imperiously against a wall of baize , or reclining on a lace pillow as fleecy as her beautiful blonde hair . she suffered the ultimate indignity the following year at mgm , when her part in i take this woman was taken away from her and given to the cheaper verree teasdale . her director , josef von sternberg was also let go , and in fact the whole picture was redone so many times studio wags called it i re-take this woman ! the " woman " in question was hedy lamarr ; after ina claire 's hilarious showdowns with garbo in ninotchka , the studio might have thought her perfect for the part of lamarr 's central european rival . a year or so later , and edmund goulding put her to work as dorothy mcguire 's mother in the charming , underrated claudia , but that is definitely a mother part and as such , put an end to ina claire 's film career . as the countess " swana " she gets lots of billy wilder 's best lines and laughs . she 's not afraid of anyone , much less garbo . much has been written about the chemistry between garbo and melvyn douglas , indeed a delightful mix , but the picture would have lacked a lot of its edge without swana 's steely , icy hauteur and her adroit manipulations . in real life ina claire lived on to a great old age . she was 92 when the last curtain fell for her , and here in san francisco , where she spent most of her life , all the lights in her building went off for an hour , precisely at 8:30 , while her fans stood on the street , devoted and vigilant in our own way as the fans surrounding the dakota hotel when john lennon died
books neg 526.txt i was optimistic when i saw the title , but you know that old saying , " do n't judge a book by its cover .

dvd pos 994.txt i think a lot of people miss the power of this movie . to me this is a scathing view of how simple minded religious people are duped by ministries in this country . even though this was made some years ago before the advent of the infamous tv ministries today , the message is still clear . those who have only a simplistic relgious outlook are prey for the kind of charletans portrayed in this movie . this is certainly one of burt lancaster 's better roles , and he plays it with much guesto ! if we were to look at most of the popular ministers today we would find that many are from this dark kind of background . this movie has a strong message . do n't listen to the word of god from others . if you must believe in the wild stories of the bible , do so in your own way . do not sanction phoney churches and preachers with your time and money ! even in this modern day and age , the influence of this kind of hokem is still strong . mr. bush and the republican party used it as a means to seek re-election ! everyone who is a born again christian , or a church goer of any kind should see this movie and perhaps get a better understanding of what the religious industry is in this country . the ending of the film is perhaps a bit contrived , meant to imply the dangers of man assuming the powers of the almighty ( if there is one ) . still , a powerful film for its time and contains a worthwhile message for viewers today .

books pos 265.txt this book is a very detailed starting point for renaisance fans . at its heart this is a socio-economic history . the clever inclusion of climate and geographic conditions presuasively explained why prosperous capitalism grew in some regions while others remained stagnant . chapter 5 - " the human unit " was the most informative . most facets of history are here for the reader to absorb . this is the type of book we all wished we had in school

software neg 666.txt this is the most god awful method for learning a language i have ever encountered . my jaw dropped when i saw that nasa and other government agencies were using this software in order to learn a foreign language . if that is truly the case then i demand my tax dollars back . it is that bad . the reason i gave this software a shot is because their marketing campaign has been asserting that it was the absolute definitive method for learning a new language . you 're probably looking at it for the same reason . first , you should know that you can purchase a set of flash cards from your local bookstore and it is just as effective as any rosetta stone softare and costs 90% less . i used this software when i borrowed it from a friend in order to see if it was better than my current method of learning mandarin , which i 'll get into later . i had an opportunity to make copies of this software when it was in my possession but decided against it . not out of fear of piracy penalties , just plain because i would rather not have this software than have a copy of it . that 's really how awful it is . imagine if your parents tried to teach you english by only teaching you noun / picture association ? it would n't work unless you learned about proper english grammar and proper syntax . if you learned about verbs and other things . this program will assume you know all your chinese numbers automatically . in the very beginning a picture of a little girl will show up and it will verbally say ' one little girl ' in mandarin.. . however it will not tell you which word means the number one , which word means girl , and so on . it 's a guessing game , not a learning experience . all the positive reviews i 've seen for any rosetta stone software on amazing seem absolutely phony and fabricated to me ( especially on the rosetta stone japanese page ) . please beware , and there is no better way to prove that what i 'm saying is true other than trying a demo for yourself . i am sure that it is as bad as the full retail version that i used for a week . the absolute best method i 've used for learning mandarin has been pimsleur 's audio cds . ( i 've never tried berlitz and pimsleur 's other competitors , but i 'm sure they are better than rosetta stone ) . i have used mandarin i and ii so far from pimsleur , and i am able to hold impressive conversations with other fluent speakers of mandarin . the great thing about it is that pimsleur explains everything to you , allows you to say it out loud , there is no brute memorization involved with pimsleur , only natural language assimilation . just ask yourself this , when you learned english as a child . did you learn by learning how to read and write first ? or did you learn how to speak and listen first ? did n't you learn syntax first and then use what you learned to formulate your own sentences ? that 's exactly how pimsleur has taught me mandarin . i was surprised how i was able to create my own grammatically correct sentences with pimsleur only a few lessons in . go ahead and try a demo of any rosetta stone language . it should be enough to keep you away from rosetta stone in favor of any of their competitors . i 've heard good things about berlitz and others , but pimsleur in my opinion is the absolute best .
dvd neg 286.txt what a huge disappointment this release is . i was suspecting that it would n't be all that great when i saw that the studio that originally produced this show , 20th century fox , was the same video company releasing it . well , the first season looks horrible . the source material is all 16mm dupe prints , some parts of which are out of focus , scratched and dirty . in all cases the image is soft and , well , like 16mm . compared to what fox is releasing of voyage to the bottom of the sea , produced the same year ( 1964 ) and at the same studio as boone , this release is nothing short of a disgrace . we should be given pristine 35mm source material , and we 're not . i suspect fox would n't release the original camera negs from it 's vaults without a substantial fee . anyway , season one of daniel boone is n't worth buying . i have n't seen season two , when the show started filming in color , but i 'm now afraid to look
music pos 600.txt in 1976 , my fair lady returned to broadway , in a revival touted as the " 20th anniversary " production . perhaps most famously , this particular revival was the first big professional splash of a young soprano called christine andreas.. . at long last , this much sought-after cast album gets its cd premiere . christine andreas is one of the best eliza 's ever captured on disc , and ian richardson 's performance as beleaguered tutor higgins is full of wit and humour . george rose ( in a tony-winning turn as eliza 's dustman father ) is very enjoyable in his main numbers " with a little bit of luck " and " get me to the church on time " . jerry lanning also makes for a fine freddy , with the winsome " on the street where you live " . this recording also features the " embassy waltz " sequence , which was never included on the obc , and only featured as a bonus track on the reissue of the olc . the production itself heavily recreated the original production , complete with oliver smith 's sets and cecil beaton 's costumes . hanya holm 's choreography was revived thanks to original dance captain crandall diehl . christine andreas picked up a theatre world award for her breakthrough performance . the show opened at the st. james theatre on march 25th 1976 , but later moved to the lunt-fontanne theatre where it closed the following year after 377 performances . the following year , andreas returned to broadway in another important revival , the 1978 production of " oklahoma ! " in which she made a thrilling laurey ( cast album available on rca ) ; before cememting her position as broadway 's ingenue of choice , with the role of frankie frayne in the 1983 revival of " on your toes " ( cast album available on jay / ter ) . more recently , she played marguerite st. just , in the original company of frank wildhorn 's flawed " scarlet pimpernel " ( cast album available on atlantic ) . i heartily recommend this particular my fair lady

camera neg 114.txt at 300mm this lens is very soft , it 's hard to get a shot that looks like it 's in focus . to do so , you need to shoot at about f / 11 , and then since there is little light available , you usually have to bump the iso to 800 or 1600 just to get an acceptable shutter speed . of course , the high iso then introduces other artifacts . the focus is also dead slow and often does n't lock on . this is a lens that i have constantly fought with . do n't upgrade to the new 70-300 is either , as it 's only marginally better . buy the 70-200 f / 4l . it 's a far superior lens
dvd neg 954.txt if the girls in this film were considered " hot " back in 1979 then i 'm glad i was still in preschool . some unattractive women , not college age girls , but actual 30-year-old women who cannot get into the popular pi sorority start their own sorority called h.o.t.s. which stands for help out the seals and sadly their pet seal was the best part of the movie . the goal of the h.o.t.s. girls is to steal all the guys away from pi house , so they throw " wild " parties , jump topless out of a airplane ( too bad the camera was on the ground ) , fly a hot air balloon over the pi house to launch pies on the pi girls as they sunbathe topless , etc. the script seems to have been written by a 12-year-old , which is n't a bad thing . i liked the fast-paced wackiness of it all and the frequent topless scenes were nice . unfortunately i did n't find any of the girls even remotely attractive . if this film was remade today with the same amount of nudity and with nikki ziering , brittany daniel , shannon elizabeth and jenna jameson as the four main h.o.t.s. girls and maybe catherine bell as the house mom it would gross over $800 million in dvd sales . i also agree with one of the previous reviewers who complained about the lack of rear shots . how rude

books pos 351.txt i was a little wary about the title but this was not at all about weight gain and / or loss ; weight was incidental . in this fiercely intelligent novel , dorothy and justine are both desperately lonely women , both victims of abuse , and yet are different in other ways . their parents often failed them , their childhood was often full of shame and self-sabotage , but gaitskill writes this with complexity , always aware that a victim can also be a victimizer . gaitskill is never sentimental . underneath her narrative , underneath the pain and the sex scenes ( which are never fully loving ) and the disappointments and loneliness , is a raging anger at the inability of human beings to connect - on race , on class , but mostly on gender . i sensed that anna granite , the intellectual whose shadow dominates this narrative , and who is the reason dorothy and justine first meet , is gaitskill 's platform for displaying her keen intellect ; and sometimes there is a hint of didactism . but this is a minor quibble . the last section moved me very much and proved that although gaitskill abhors sentimentality , she can certainly do sentiment well . ` humanity ' is a word often found in this book . our sexuality is connected to our humanity . our ability to treat other human beings like human beings is what makes us human . in the end , gaitskill 's brilliant , wonderfully feminist novel was , for me , about how easily we strip each other of our humanity .

camera pos 643.txt at least for now it is : - ) . during the course of the past 10-12 months i have owned 7 , that 's seven , digital cameras : canon s230 ; kodak v530 ; 5 different models of casio's : z60 , z600 , z850 , p700 ; and most recently presented my wife with a red s770 for valentine 's day . i also had a pretty good chance to evaluate canon sd450 ( my brother-in-law owns one - it was actually a gift from my wife and i to him for his 21st birthday ) , casio ex-s600 ( a good friend of mine owns one ) , and panasonic dmc-tz1 ( once again , a gift from my wife and i to my father-in-law for his last birthday ) . if you read any of my digital camera reviews ( and i 've written a few by now ) , then you know that i 'm not particularly fond of canon 's lately - i think they are overrated and overpriced for what they have to offer . as i also mentioned before , i 've tried several different kodak models ( and i used to work for the company too ! ) , but all of them turned out to be a waste of my time , to say the least . i became a big fan of casio 's , although not all of my experiences with them were great . but being a huge gadget " freak " that i am , and constantly wanting new " toys " , i have always craved for more . over time , my tastes in digital cameras have changed from having a simple point and shoot type of camera to wishing for more power and manual control . so one by one , i returned / sold all of my cameras , and after extensive ( and i really do mean extensive ) research , i got myself an lx2. i must say though that i probably would n't have without getting to know my father-in-law 's tz1 first . i was actually quite impressed with it . powerful zoom , sharp lens , decent picture quality . i also played with some other panasonic models in various stores just to get a better feel for them , as well as spent a few hours on the phone , and exchanged numerous e-mails with a friend of mine who owns an fz30 , and who swears by it . unfortunately , lx2 was not available anywhere locally , but i felt that i got a pretty good understanding of what panasonic 's cameras are all about , and after some more thought and consideration , i went ahead and bought it from amazon ( nice thing about buying from amazon is that you can always return whatever it is you bought , including digital cameras , within 30 days for a full refund , no questions asked ) . i did know about the " noise " issue at high iso 's , but it was n't a decisive factor for me , and i 'm glad i did n't pay much attention to it and got the camera anyway . it turned out to be one of the best purchases i 've made in a long while . here is why : pros : - superb design . this camera is wonderfully crafted . and i absolutely love black ! it gives the camera a nice , clean , professional look . i do n't think i 'll be buying another silver camera soon after having this one ; - intuitive controls , and menus . i charged the battery , put it into the camera , and started using it and taking pictures right away , without even going through the manual once ; - a load of features , including a large , bright , widescreen lcd ; wide angle , super sharp leica lens with a 4x zoom ; mega ois - optical image stabilization control ( optical means it 's done mechanically , which is a true way of doing stabilizing , comparing to other cameras where it 's done by " tricking " the camera into using higher iso 's ) ; and many more . in addition , it has a joystick for an easy access to different menus , has a number of manual controls , as well as provides ability to shoot in raw format ( more on that later ) ; - it comes with silkypix developer studio software for working with camera raw files . for someone who is not familiar with raw - it 's a " pure " , camera specific picture format . it varies upon a manufacturer , meaning that canon raw is different from nikon or panasonic raw , for example . and it 's " pure " in a sense that it 's of a much better quality than a standard jpeg ( jpg ) , and does n't suffer from loss of information , such as white balance , or brightness . there is a lot more to raw than that , and i 'm not going to go into details right now . what i want to say , however , is that having previously owned a camera which supported raw format ( casio ex-p700 ) , i must have tried about a dozen of different raw editing software packages , including products from adobe , ulead , arcsoft , photofiltre , picture window pro , acdsee , lightzone , image broadway , and more . silkypix delivered by far the best results of all . the only one that i would probably put next to it is bibble ; - noise - what noise ? ! i really hate it when i hear people complaining about noise in this camera ( after having it tried myself ) , or any other compact digital camera for that matter . are you really that naïve that you think that you will get absolutely no noise in your images using a compact digital camera ? think again . you might have noticed that i 've used the word " compact " several times here . i 've done it on purpose - it is inevitable for a compact digital camera to produce some noise . some cameras are better than others , but no matter how hard you try , you will see some . this camera is no better or worse than any other one that i 've had / tried . at higher iso 's ( above 400 ) , it 's slightly more visible , but who in the right state of mind is using anything over iso 200 on a compact digital camera , such as this one , anyway ? i always have mine set to a 100. if i feel that it does n't get the job done , i shoot in raw ; - picture quality is very good . yes , it does take some time getting used to , but once you familiarize yourself with everything this camera is capable of , you can achieve spectacular results , especially if you do n't mind doing some post processing . as much as i like everything this camera has to offer , there are , however , some things that kind of irritate me . here is a short list of bad things about this camera , otherwise known as cons : - first of all , this camera has actually been somewhat misrepresented . it 's been advertised as a 10.2 megapixel camera , which is not entirely true . 10.2 mp resolution is available only in 16:9 ( wide ) aspect ratio . two more ratios are available - 3:2 , and a more conventional 4:3 , but those offer 8.5 , and 7.5 mp resolutions respectively . so if you compare this camera to others that do n't have a widescreen format , or if you prefer to shoot only in a regular 4:3 mode , then this camera should only be referred to as a 7 mp digital camera ( because not all the pixels are actually effective ) . obviously , panasonic is aware of it , and marketed it having higher pixel count on purpose , to boost consumer 's interest ; - i expected to see a compact digital camera . what i got instead was actually a smaller compact camera than i expected . i was really surprised to see how small , yet convenient to hold and operate , the camera body was . what i did n't like , however , was the lens . not the lens itself , it 's actually quite superb , but the fact that it sticks out . i like cameras with lenses that retract all the way back to the camera body . i realize that it would probably loose some features , like the wide angle , and perhaps zoom , but i still wish it did that . it would be so much more.. . umm.. . compact ? ! the way it actually is makes it quite difficult to find the right case for it . almost impossible , i should say . i 've tried a few , but they are either too small or too big . i just ca n't find one that would fit right . i put an order for an slx1b case for it , which is specifically designed to fit lx1 , and lx2 models , but i hear they are not that good . we shall see ; - i 'm not a big fan of a pop-up flash . i always keep forgetting to open it when i need to use it . and it also seems a bit flimsy . i 'm treating it as carefully as i can , but i just ca n't stop thinking that it might break soon ; - i hate the lens cap ! ! ! there , i said it . it 's probably just one of those small annoyances that keep frustrating you until you get used to it , but for now i 'm not really happy with it . summary : despite very few minor negatives , i think lx2 is probably one of the best , most innovative cameras on the market today , and i sure am glad to have one . it offers more than any other camera in the same price range , and can even compete with some dslr 's when it comes to picture quality . if you are someone like me , who wants to have more control and / or learn more about digital photography , or a dslr user who just needs a solid backup to carry everywhere , then this camera is not be overlooked ! highly recommended

dvd pos 260.txt the beautiful young brooke shields plays 11 / 12 year old violet , daughter of hattie ( susan sarandon ) a new orleans prostitute living and working in a brothel in 1917. violet has been raised in the brothel and has not been to school and has known no other life or anything about the outside world . when she turns 12 , her virginity is auctioned off . brooke shields ' portrayal of violet is poignant and beautiful . her childish charms and innocence are so heart-wrenchingly sweet . the scene where she jumps up and down on the photographer 's bed ( very childlike ) and asks him whether he will take care of her before throwing her arms around him and giving him small childlike kisses on the nose , forehead etc. and reciting that little rhyme really pulled at my heart strings ! i just wanted to jump into the tv and give her a hug ! ! this , mixed with the seductive adult things that she also says in this scene ( and others ) is particularly poignant as we know that young violet is merely reciting what she 's heard from the prostitutes . the photographer also says that violet does n't know what she 's saying . you just want to turn the clock back , hug violet and give her a proper childhood ! the photographer marries her because he 's fascinated with her beauty , innocence and is concerned that she is only a child and should not be in a brothel becoming a prostitute . the part where he gives her a doll is poignant as she has already lost her virginity and it seems that he 's trying to give back her childhood , sadly she 's been exposed to too much , too soon in her life . susan sarandon and brooke shields are wonderful in this movie as well as keith carradine , the photographer . the art aspect & music soundtrack are amazing . this movie deals with a taboo subject seen through the eyes of a child as ' normal ' which enhances poignancy and brings out the viewers maternal need to ' rescue ' young violet .

dvd neg 630.txt first off , robert deniro as the monster . i saw him and immediately thought of jake lamotta or vito corleone . they did n't even try to disguise his accent and no-one ever explains why the monster sounds like he just got off the plane from new york . second , kenneth brannagh was so in love with the set that he forgot about story . finally the scene where elizabeth was ressurected was ridiculous . frankenstien 's shock that she 's not happy to be back- -burnt up , cut of and her heart pulled out of her chest- - was supposed to be touching but i laughed . we all know how great kenneth brannagh is but he got completely carried away here and the result was really , really , really bad . i give it two stars for the pretty costumes and utter magnificence of aidan quinn 's face .
camera pos 352.txt if you are looking for a great all around camera , this is it ! our kids play sports and are in constant motion and the sports mode captures it all . also love the " last 4 " feature , gets some great action shots . we had the fuji 7000 before this and they have definately fixed the features that bugged me . love the new manual zoom ( if you like 35mm lenses your like this ) as well as the battery drain . i used to have to replace batteries every day , now its more like once a week with the amount we use it . my other favorite feature is the dual memory slots for those times where i forget to put it back in the camera after downloading ! so there is always one in there ! . the video comes out great and with the new manual lens you can zoom during video shots . in general , without spending a lot more , you get a great camera that keeps up with an active " picture happy " family
music pos 628.txt five stars may be excessive if you judge this cd alongside the greatest classics , but when compared to similar cds within the singer-songwriter folk-rock genre , this beautifully simple and powerful collection really shines . i find myself coming back to this cd more often than to many better-known classics because it has a freshness and originality that sustain interest . the writing , while occasionally a bit awkward , is consistently interesting , honest and moving . the themes of introspection , nostalgia , regret , and defiance are presented in a searingly personal manner . the song " if i were a man " is a rich celeration of the wonders women bring to relationships and the world ; " child of steel " plucks the heartstrings with an achingly wistful delicacy ; and " take my body " is a strong lament about the objectification of women . i especially love the pared-down guitar arrangements ; the simplicity really works with ms. cash 's strong vocals and makes me wish some of my other favorite vocalists would occasionally just get back to basic guitar accompaniments . i 've seen ms. cash perform live and , while she has other hits that may be more popular , this collection reveals her unique brilliance

camera pos 216.txt " wow ! " is all i can say to express my reaction after getting prints taken with my 17-40. i 've been using nikon manual-focus nikkors since 1988 and was always satisfied with the color and sharpness . however , after using the canon " l " series , i 've sold a lot of my nikkors . the color , clarity , sharpness , and detail of the " l " lenses are amazing . the prints have this 3-d effect ( without having to use those silly red / blue glasses ! ) 8 - ) within 3 weeks of receiving my 17-40 , i ordered the 70-200. those two lenses will replace my whole nikkor collection . build is really good . the " l " zooms are a little bulkier , but very managable . the nikkors are smaller , but very heavy . but lense technology and coatings have improved so much in 20 years , i can see the difference . i tested the lens by pointing it toward the sun . the 17-40 surprising handles flare very well . with the sun just outside the field of view , there was very little flare and loss of contrast . i also make 12x18 prints , and this lens handles them easily . the body is going to be the limiting factor ( refering to digital bodies ) . warning : once you use " l " glass , you are going to be spoiled . you may not settle for consumer lenses anymore , although some non-l lenses are quick good from what i read
software pos 165.txt i feel home designer suite 6 is a good value for the price . it obviously is not a full blown pro program , which i think many people expect , however it is a great tool for an ordinary person to do preliminary plans for new construction or remodeling . those plans can then be provided to a architect or builder as a foundation for final planning . it is quite easy to learn the basics by merely following the tutorials in the manual , or on the provided cd

books neg 164.txt after reading the delightful charlie and the chocolate factory , this sequel was an absolute let-down . the novel begins with the great glass elevator breaking through the ceiling of charlie 's ( formerly wonka 's ) chocolate factory and rocketing into orbit around the earth . while beyond the reaches of earth 's atmosphere , our heroes- --charlie , grandpa joe , and mr. wonka- --must deal with the malleable and voracious vermicious knids ( pronounced " k'nids " ) , aliens which resemble unfrighteningly hostile figs or turds with eyes . far worse than these beasties , though , are the insufferable old folks whose twenty-year stint in their shared bed has made them less than useless . charlie , joe , and wonka , with no help from charlie 's folks or other grandparents , save themselves and a us spacecraft from the clutches of the knids and return to the chocolate factory , where the old timers stupidly overdose on youth pills , returning them to infancy or beyond . charlie and wonka race around trying to help these ancient parasites , who respond to this assistance with the thanklessness the reader comes to expect from these oldsters . at the end of the novel , the geriatric brigade finally leaves the bed when they have a chance to meet the president . in short , these three are the most tedious , spiteful , unredeemable characters i 've come across in children 's literature and i hoped that they would be eaten by the knids or the gnoolies or even the oompa-loompas as i read this book . as it is , they ( unlike the awful kids in the chocolate factory ) learn no lessons and persist in their curmudgeonly parasitism from the first page to the last . their presence throughout the novel rendered it a chore , rather than a joy , to read .
books neg 183.txt i did not find this book very helpful . there is an entire chapter dedicated to which expensive pots are the best to & quot ; invest&quot ; in ( it seems the pricier the better , and i mean several hundred dollars , i actually went to stores and priced the recommended brands ) and what kind of fancy kitchen gadgets are needed to create gourmet meals . i am not a professional chef , just a simple housewife that enjoys preparing simple , good-tasting meals for my family , the recipes here seem to be time-consuming and complicated . not much money to be saved here
music neg 578.txt this recording is not great company . i 'm really confused : is it a broadway recording or a very poor amatuer recording ? and if so , did this rubbish actually make it to the broadway stage ? i feel for the people that saw it , and were expecting the rich full melodies that sondheim produced for this show . the musical director for this abomination should be called a mutilation director , because that is precisely what he did to the music of this show . so the only advice i give to future musical directors that want to revive and revamp a show : if it 's not broke , please , please , please do n't try and fix it ! some things are just perfect the way they are . do n't buy this cd . i did and it is now a coaster where it gets better use
music pos 155.txt this is a fantastic album . the fact that 5 star reviews are still being submitted over 10 years after its release ( and they 're not the beatles or u2 or anything ) should speak volumes . i have played this cd countless times over the years and i am amazed that i am not sick of it . i am a pretty constant consumer of new music . get this cd - you wo n't regret it ! ( ps i 've never done an amazon review before , but the fact that this has had only 22 motivated me ) . it is melodic , catchy , uplifting and cheeky - in short , a little piece of musical bliss .
music neg 337.txt this is an endurance test . as in ' bitches brew''live evil''love at the fillmore ' latter day miles consists of moments of brilliance combined with long stretches of absolute tedium . it makes ' jack johnson ' a real non event and considering the quality of musicians on board it is a real surprise . take ' yesternow ' it takes for ever for billy cobham to find a beat . this is just self indulgence of the worse kind , a trait which unfortunately perpetrated a lot of the jazz fusion crossovers . miles seems to want to create ' moods ' and ends up with twenty minute plus of wallpaper music . this album is the complete nadir of his jazz crossover period . mcgaughlin 's guitar though breathtaking in the mahavisuna orchestra here contents himself with silly little runs , totally without any structure and fire ( this unfortunately was the same throughout his stay with miles ) disjointed would be too kind a word . when you reliased that this was edited from long jams it makes you wonder how dull the unreleased parts were ( i dread to even contemplate ) . miles playing though usually inspired and lyrical here struggles to solo over the fast tempo 's and is embarassingly weak . maybe if i saw the film it was supposed to accompany i might view this differant , but without that it is just a meandering and unfocused mess
dvd pos 915.txt richard dreyfuss is excellent as a cop on a stakeout ( along with partner emilio estevez ) of pretty madeleine stowe ( they have to watch her house through the night ) , and he falls in love with her . before the movie is over there 's a big car chase and an exciting climax in a lumber mill with a killer ( aidan quinn ) . it 's pretty standard fare for this kind of cop movie , but the script is above average - especially the dialogue - and dreyfuss 's performance is right on target . a very entertaining movie ; definitely worth a watch

dvd pos 834.txt i just watched " mommie dearest " for the first time tonight . as most critics and fans of " mommie dearest " acknowledge , the film portrays such a pitiful story of abuse , with such an over-dramatic ( but entirely true-to-life ) performance by faye dunaway , it was both hilarious and depressing . i 'm 30 and did n't know much about joan crawford outside of the endless chatter about the film being " classic camp . " seems to me crawford was probably bi-polar or had some other unexplained mental disorder . i think she was quite aware that some of the insanity she lived with was caused by movie industry she was dedicated to . she knew the industry poisoned any good thing she endeavored to do , whether it was having a successful marriage , a happy family , or even giving to charity . her life was a running commercial directed by hollywood , not unlike the tabloid-driven , image-obsessed hollywood we have today . despite the often-times hilarious image of her and her sibling 's victimization on film , christina 's abuse and disappointment with her mother was real and painful at some point in her life . christina crawford was completely justified turning her mother 's image on its head with her book and movie . yes , the movie is outrageous but it is also empowering . after all , what can the powerless do about their pitiful past except laugh . mocking the unexplained , unjustified pain you experienced in the past , renders it powerless to harm your future . this is the legacy of " mommie dearest " whatever joan crawford really was

dvd neg 391.txt this was a very annoying and boring flick thats barely watchable and throughout the film i kept looking at my watch , the film is not a historical drama nor is it an autobiographical film about william shakespreare infact it is a romantic comedy disguised as a historical drama . my girlfriend insisted that we watch this film together but i was n't in the mood she forced me to watch this , the film was about a struggling young writer shakespeare played by joseph fiennes who falls in love with lady viola played by gwyneth paltro who also happens to inspire his famous play romeo and juliet , this film also won a couple of oscars including gwyny for best actress but i felt like the film was just not that funny because all the characters seemed to talk in an old english style thats hard to understand . overall the film was just o.k. i think that some of the sets and costumes were fantastic and judi dench was great as queen elizabeth but i never want to watch this film again , if your a shakspeare fan and like romantic comedies then you might like this film more than i did .

health pos 343.txt as a dentist of over 20+ years experience , i have seen over and over again the results of not flossing one 's teeth . the unfortunate result of such neglect is cavities ( especially in kids ) , and inevitable gum disease in adults , which in both cass over time leads to tooth loss . gum disease almost always starts in-between the teeth and the only way to clean the germs that cause gum disease and cavities from between the teeth is with floss . mechanical scrubbing with floss is the key , and all the daily brushings and rinsings will not remove the in-between stubborn plaque below the gumline . the bottom line is that we need to floss our teeth if we want to keep them for a lifetime . i have heard all the excuses for not flossing : the floss is too hard to handle , my fingers turn blue , my fingers are too fat , i 'm too clumsy , the floss hurts my gums , etc , etc. this disposable flosser is great for kids , who may not have the dexterity to load a non-disposable flosser , such as the " flossaide dental floss holder " , which i recommend for adults ( see my review ) . i have recommended this floss aid to my young patients over the years and i strongly recommend it to you as well . one still has to develop the habit of flossing daily , and this device aides in the mechanics of flossing , making it a breeze . get it and save your teeth ! jim " konedog " koeni

dvd pos 589.txt i grew up with the original ds . i also saw the two " spin off " movies : " house of dark shadows " and " night of dark shadows . " needless to say i was extremely excited about the " revival , " and i was n't disappointed . i felt that dan curtis was actually able to improve upon the original , by tightening up the script and employing wonderful actors who fit like the proverbial glove . the original barnabus was played by jonathan frid who was a shakespearian trained actor and , ben cross is a member of the royal shakespearian theatre in london . i loved that the revival was able to be more overtly sexual , which as any fan of vampires must know is an essential element of the myth . and i must say this series lived up to my every expectation . dan curtis took the original and made it completely accessible to older viewers who have such fond memories of the 1963 soap opera . i looked forward to 3:30 every day after school . it 's too bad that the gulf war killed it . yes it did ! i was there . after the sunday , monday miniseries , that friday was to air the first " episode .

" give the album a chance " ..... or.. .

music neg 41.txt i wanted to like brotherhood , for the simple reason that nearly every new order fan this side of the galaxy has dismissed it , usually with a faint whiff of snobbery ( or at least apathy ) . turns out they were right : brotherhood is half an album . most of its nine songs feel unfinished , as if the band wanted to cash in on the success of their 1985 smash low-life and did n't care about the end result . brotherhood is a rush job , plain and simple , but there are still glimmers of hope within this bare-bones effort . " as it is when it was " overcomes the album 's overall muddy production by dint of being mostly acoustic , and the melody is quite lovely . " all day long " , the emotional centerpiece of the album by default , is an intelligent ( if half-hearted ) protest against child abuse . while " angel dust " lacks a decent hook , its subtly danceable beat and effective synth noodlings will at least briefly hold your interest . and the toss-off " every little counts " has a charming sense of humor that is too often lacking in new order 's work . the most popular song on brotherhood is , of course , " bizarre love triangle " . so good it seems to belong to a different album entirely , " bizarre love triangle " is truly new order 's masterpiece . the solid beat , slick sequencer work , and gorgeous melody showcase the band at their best : catchy , danceable , and downright euphoric . ( imagine how well it would have fit on low-life . ) sadly , the rest of brotherhood is unremarkable . the album 's production neatly mixes rock with electronic flourishes , which has become new order 's signature sound , but the songwriting does n't measure up . buy the album if you 're a trainspotter , but casual new order fans would be better off picking up low-life or 1983 's power , corruption and lies . this one is just a footnote .

music neg 159.txt it was about time the spell kasey chambers originally cast on me wore off - i 'd become a huge fan of the captain and barricades & brickwalls , but there was all something a little nagging about even those two very good records . chambers , a unique betty boop squeak of a voice , was a lustrous presence in rootsy contexts , and the best moments of those records were snarky updates on an old form , but the worst moments were forgettable alt-country duldrums of patched together cliches . wayward angel , chambers ' third album , had some great songs on it , but its pop and country predictability overtook a good half of the album . carnival shows chambers at her weakest - sad girl anthems of generic empowerment about the rain , bad girl anthems of doin-wrong that sound about as risky as songs on the disney channel 's afternoon lineup . " light up a candle " fakes its slinkiness and turns dull , " surrender " adds a dido production of drum machines and computer bleeps that do n't mask the song 's epic ordinariness , ballads like " dangerous " limp along to their own generic lethargy . chambers is n't without charm - " sign on the door " and " i got you now " are impossible to not find fun - yet chambers worst instincts as a song writer threaten to take over even the good songs - " hard road , " a sad and moving movie-ready duet , borders on self-parody - lines like " there 's a heavy jacket / there 's a heavy load / there 's a weight on my shoulders / it 's a hard road " read like a laundry list of related lines from every sad and moving movie-ready song you 've ever heard
books pos 520.txt the working notes of this book are utterly staggering in their implication to ontology . what is being ? merleau answers in the manner of lao-tse , and alludes to something like a divine-feminine at the heart of wild perception . it was said by sartre in his autobiography & quot ; situations&quot ; that after merleau 's mother died who was like a & quot ; goddess&quot ; to him merleau returned began the project anew . what is intimated in the working notes is invaluable to the true student of philosophy and life . and in the end , merleau returns to the very object of his study . you can really feel this descent at the book nears its end . it is , however , an ascent of the entirety of the history of philosophy to a new level of comprehension . that i assure you

software pos 572.txt after looking at the other reviews , i was a bit puzzled . i have n't had any of the problems other folks mention . pdf converter professional 4 does n't do everything that programs costing five times as much money . but , who cares ? background colors in a business form ? why ? ? ? ? do n't buy a camry and say " gee.. . i liked my lexus better .

books neg 252.txt this book is written from the viewpoint of a flaming socialist with the attitude that anything white or european or is overly valued in american history textbooks . loewen does have many valid points about what history textbooks omit , but the degree to which he is clearly slanted to the left is ludicrous . " lies my teacher told me " could have been an amazing book , but all it did was aggrivate me and motivate me to write a 23 page paper debunking half of what the author wrote , much to the dismay of my idiotic sociology professor . the only reason i did n't give the book 1 star is because the overall intent and effort put forth were good , but the book as a whole is just far too biased

books neg 198.txt i picked up this volume because its title suggested that it would encourage hands-on science activities that are essential to good teaching and effective learning . unfortunately , i discovered on reading it that the author combines a deep antagonism for the scientific & quot ; establishment&quot ; with credulity for numerous fringe ideas . the first experiment that he suggests tests the hypothesis that your pet uses psychic powers to tell when you 'll be home for dinner ! sheldrake frequently presents anecdotes as & quot ; evidence&quot ; . the & quot ; do it yourself&quot ; promise of the title is broken for the reader who does n't intend to begin raising homing pidgeons or does n't happen to work in a laboratory capable of measuring the physical constants ( such as the speed of light ) to nine significant figures . far too few cautions about the pitfalls of psychic research are given ( in chapters about the feeling of being stared at , or & quot ; feeling&quot ; the touch of a severed limb ) . despite the nearly fatal flaws of the book , i liked a part of its message , that important science can still be done by amateurs . that 's about the only aspect of this book that is commendable

dvd pos 717.txt this is one of the best g3s . maybe even the best . i would have said that it was definitely the best if not for mr.malmsteen - the nicest thing one can say about the latter is that he knows his minor and major scales . but *i* do n't want to be nice . i want to be absolutely and unequivocally cruel when it comes to malmsteen . he knows alternate picking , i 'll give him that . but then , so do i - and a million others . he should n't be up there playing with vai and satriani solely because he can alternate pick faster than most ( not all ) people . and yet he is . he shows over and over again , in this show , that the only thing he can do with the guitar is shred and shred and shred some more . that 's all . one of the interesting things about this dvd is that one cannot really measure the time between two consecutive shredding runs that yngwie chooses to execute - it 's less than about a second . and this is an *average* figure . enough about yngwie , though he is the reason i 'm writing this review - satriani is absolutely amazing , as usual , with a brand new rendition of ' midnight ' and a nice solo at the end of ' starry night' . vai , though , steals the show . this coming from a guy who prefers satriani . but i ca n't help it - he is really that good . and better . ' i know you 're here ' ( which he plays on a triple neck jem ) contains at least seven new approaches to the same old things that you 're taught at guitar school . it is also the best song steve vai has ever written after ' fire garden suite' . ' juice ' and ' i 'm the hell outta here ' are also really really really good . overall , a great dvd , though you should probably skip the parts with yngwie in it
music neg 402.txt i like jennifer lopez , but i am not a fan of j.lo...let me explain . jennifer started her career in the mid 90s , did some promising work ( selena / out of sight / the cell / blood and wine / etc. ) , and a very well done debut album for an actor ( on the 6 ) . everything was genuinely promising . unfortunately , once " j.lo " was born ( circa 2001 ) , her endeavours got weak , too commercial for the sake of money , too fixed only to hype her up , not all that original nor different than anyone else , to truly stand out . " rebirth " is an example of that . when i heard get right for the first time , i loved it , i thought it was catchy . it harkened the days of on the 6..that sassy , groovy , r-n-b vibe she had . then i caught step into my world , the only real r-n-b track on the album and thought , i 'm feelin ' it , definitely a favorite to this day . the the rest came along ( 3-11 ) and i thought , sony & j.lo made this for the sake of money , due to her films doing poorly , hence she had time off to commit to recording a new album . i thought it was a very obviously fake attempt to compensate . i think she is a great performer , a very talented person , but i honestly do n't feel this album makes her an artist , merely a reworking of herself musically . i rank it 3rd in her album line.. . on the 6 ( 4 stars ) j.lo ( 3 stars ) rebirth ( 2 stars ) this is me...then ( 2 stars )

camera neg 624.txt first off , many of these reviews address the actual use with this telescope....i cannot even comment on how well this telecope works because the two that were sent to me were broken ! i ordered well before christmas as a gift for my son...but to be his big gift from santa claus . my husband opened the telescope up late christmas eve to put it together and have it ready in front of the christmas tree and right away it was clear that this telescope was broken . the 2 mounting screws were bent , very bent . this puts you in quite a position when it needs to be up and ready for your child . after a whole lot of effort with amazon 's customer service ( from another country ! ) they sent a replacement...to the wrong address ! ! ( long story that i will not bore you with . ) when the 2nd telescope arrived my husband once again opens it up and guess what ? they same screws were again bent . the box on the outside was not damaged , but something is not working for them . i am so disapointed with them . this was the first time i had purchased something this big from amazon . i have mainly done music and movies , small stuff . after this experience i will no longer buy a big ticket item that would have the possibility of damage . it 's just not worth the headache and problems , not to mention disapointment , to my son . i would proceed with caution when ordering this item from amazon . if you get a broken one...you just might be receiving the 2 i have had to return

dvd neg 240.txt the little rascals collection is a set of 5 dvds with a few shorts on each dvd , the fifth disk with an extra from the 50s and a documentary about child stars . this set was poorly put together , the shorts included are quite random , and buying this set would be a waste of money . each disk opens with a montage of some of the characters . first there is alfalfa , then buckwheat , spanky , darla , porky , mickey , stymie , then fatty - oh wait , no that is joe cobb only they did n't know his real name , then farina , and last phil macmahon - who you may be asking ? phil macmahon , the kid who got bitten by the love bug in a song number in our gang follies of 1938. still do n't know him ? maybe that is because he was n't a regular cast member and should never have been featured like he was in this collection . disk one features the shorts dogs of war and derby day . dogs of war is a silent film featuring the gang running loose on the hal roach lot ; it is one of my favorite shorts from the series . however , it seems that they ripped off the cabin fever print and added a worse score . derby day also seems to be lifted from the cabin fever series . it is a silent film about the gang visiting the horse races . the films themselves are very good . disk two features a rarer silent film called stage fright . it is a film about a show put on about marc anthony by the kids in front of their parents . it is a total disaster . just like in reunion in rhythm , one kid wants to go out on stage and recite poetry . the film has been seriously cut ; there are no opening credits and the short is much shorter than the usual film length . the print is washed out and new title cards have been inserted . the music is much more childish than normal silent rascals scores , but it works . there are sound effects too . sundown limited is a great short about the gang building their own train . it is a very cute film ; farina is especially funny in it . the train that the kids build would have been the envy of all the children in the neighborhood . the print is washed out and the music sounds just like grapevine video 's soundtracks . the film titled the pirates in this set is really called the buccaneers . it is also a cute film about the kids trying to build their own ship . when it sinks , they find a real one to destroy . this short has also been cut ; there is no opener for it either . it is a bad print and has kiddie music attached to it . disk three opens with mary queen of tots . it is a really enjoyable film where mary receives toys that look like the gang . she dreams they come to life , and when she wakes up , she finds the gang and believes they are her dolls come to life . this print is really bad especially considering there is a better print available on another cheaply made dvd set . it is funny that the music is the same on this set as on that one though . the fourth alarm is a film about the kids becoming junior fire fighters . the print on this one is not bad at all . the last film is school 's out , a talkie featuring a different cast . it is a film featuring miss crabtree , the new teacher . the picture is good ; it seems to be the one from cabin fever . disk four begins with bear shooters . this is a less than great film . the print is great ; it is the one from cabin fever . our gang follies of 1938 is a great film , very funny , long , and exciting . it features the later talkie cast . waldo 's last stand is a film from the later mgm years , a lesser film that seems forced . it was also released in a 5 part rascals set . disk five is the extra features dvd . it starts out with a segment from the you asked for it television show . on it , some of the silent gang are reunited . joe cobb , jackie condon , farina hoskins , johnny downs , and mickey daniels are featured . the documentary called kid stuff really does n't have a whole lot of information about the gang although jackie cooper is mentioned and butch bond does an interview . other child stars like jackie coogan , judy garland , shirley temple , roddy mcdowall , and ron howard are focused on as well . the films in this collection are films that have lapsed into the public domain . many of them have been available cheaply for years . the only reason a fan might want to see this collection , the same reason i bothered , was to see the rarer silent films . however , the rest of the set is trash

health pos 900.txt i used aveeno moisturizer and thought i would try something new . i have eczema on my face ( around my eyes , nose and mouth ) in the winter and have no signs of it after a few days . my skin is very sensitive , and have experienced burning with other products , but not this one . i sinks in quickly and is not greasy feeling or heavy , yet strong enough to tackle dry skin . i highly recommend it
music pos 845.txt the previous review has a few inaccuracies i thought i 'd correct . first off , the beats on all of atmosphere 's albums , including this one , are produced and created by ant , not dj abilities . ant does not perform live , and so slug often used to perform with dj abilities ( and others ) . this may change in the next album as atmosphere now includes a band soon to tour , but it 's extermely likely ant will be included in the production . slug has never been 1 / 3 of atmosphere , he has and always will be the main driving force and only consistent member of the group . even when spawn was a member of atmosphere , slug was still clearly the leader and brains beyond the operation , as evidenced by the tracks on overcast ! , all of which were dominated by slug . yes , this album is quite different from the newer stuff , and represents a critical moment in atmosphere 's evolution . of course , anyone can listen to it . even those silly " fan boys . " it 's a ridiculous notion to suggest that because something has changed , people wo n't like earlier incantations of the same group . it 's that elitist old school b.s. and it 's annoying . some may not like it , but most hip-hop fans will probably enjoy it . what makes this album so interesting is how raw it is , and , as slug says in the liner notes , how it 's representative of his transformation as an mc . recorded between overcast ! and lucy ford , you can witness slug move from being a whitty , well-versed thug to something deeper and more innovative . both elements are present . " the abusing of the rib " is one of the more evolved tracks on the album , while " @ it again " is about sleeping with all sorts of girls in the twin cities , including yours of course . note that i say " evolved " not in the sense that one song is better than another , but rather more representative of slug 's later work ( lucy ford ) . this album represents a critical moment in the history of what i believe is the best hip hop group ( individual ) out there . while it does n't have the catchiest melodies ( the beats are great , just not catchy ) , it has some amazing rhymes and showcases slug 's ability to flow quickly and rap prolifically . check it out
music pos 615.txt its a pretty good mix , good song choices , its mostly a harder mix , thought it could be smoother flowing though , but all in all its pretty good , also thought the robot walk to the party deal woulda made a better begining , it was a lot of down time during the middle of the cd , but hey people gotta switch it up now and then , like the last 3 / 4s better.. .
software pos 901.txt this software was easy to install . the terms and conditions of use are very clearly stated . i found the choice of difficulty levels greatly enhanced the product and challenged me . the puzzles are fun and the techniques required to play are easily understood . my one wish is that there were more varied games included... . but it is a lot of fun and is definitley challenging. .
dvd neg 185.txt season 1 of veronica mars took me by surprise , and i really enjoyed the ride . the second season , however , does n't live up to the quality of the first . instead of one large mystery , in season two viewers are treated to several smaller mysteries to solve . there 's nothing wrong with that approach , but it seemed that as fast as one mystery skien got solved , another would pop right up without any resolution for the first . many episodes ended with my friends and i turning to one another and asking , " is that it ? where 's the rest of it ? " this happened quite a bunch , with the child abuse investigation episode as perhaps the most jarring . are we really supposed to believe someone as determined as veronica would just pick up and call it quits because she gets a weird slap on the wrist ? that 's totally out of character , yet we never see that family , the abused girl , or hear about the incident again . that type of confusion and weird plot points kept popping up . the " major " villain of the season comes out of left field to be the murderer , and his motivation for murder ends up being really weak and unbelievable . because of the all the loose ends , go-nowhere plots , and the surprise villain who was probably a surprise to the writers up until deadline , i 'm giving season 2 a 2 star rating . season 2 of veronica mars still has some funny dialogue , and some clever episodes , but it does n't deserve all the 4 and 5 star reviews i 've seen . i 'll continue to watch , however , as veronica mars has a lot of promise . hopefully the producers can get things in gear for season 3
books neg 618.txt i must have missed something about this book . i ca n't believe that minority report and total recall , two movies that i did enjoy , came from this author . the stories seem to be missing something . perhaps , this version should not have been the first works by this author for me to have read

camera pos 502.txt this digital photo frame has reasonably good picture quality and once set up , can be used by anyone in the selected mode . i have it set for slide presentation mode and people enjoy looking at it . i could easily see giving it , already set up , to people who are not computer savvy , such as grandparents . to give them new pictures , send a new card and they slip that in . that said , the cost is still fairly high and the buttons on the top of the frame useless unless you have them memorized or really good vision . i would recommend this product
health pos 788.txt nv diet pills are working great for me - i lost 8lbs in a month ! ! ! they work as long as you eat healthy and exercise regularly while taking the pills . it is n't a miracle pill so if you take it but eat nonstop all day and do n't work out , of course nothing is going to happen . they really do control hunger because i take 2 a day and one day i was busy and forgot to take my 2nd pill and i was starving looking to eat anything and everything in sight
books neg 774.txt the book reads like a shallow , way too long magasine article . the shop seems to specialize in self help books , so there 's hardly a literary feel to it . the style too is annoying . for example , she writes that " her dad was n't big on books " . i would have expected a slightly " bigger " vocabulary then that
books pos 916.txt jesse , 15 lives in harlem , new york city . he is the only child of a bright couple and his best friend , rise is one of his biggest influences . jesse and rise grew up together . when rise , 17 turns to crime and joins the counts , a local street gang and insists on bringing jesse in with him along with their friend c.j. , jesse starts to reassess their friendship . he sadly realizes that he and rise are traveling down different streets ; the drive-by shooting of their friend bobby , 14 has left the neighborhood shaken . c.j. , a musical prodigy who plays piano in their church also has his sights set on a different path . it is c.j. and jesse , a budding young artist who is quite talented at drawing who realize they have more in common with each other . rise and the counts are in for a count-down ; sadly , drive-bys claim more casualties . the counts were described as being on the tame end of street gangs ; a warring faction called the diablos were responsible for shooting a friend ; killing a cabbie and later , some members of the counts . sidney , a kind and fair police officer takes the boys under his wing . he is respected in the neighborhood and word on the street was that he was a fair man , which he was . when mason , 19 an older member of the counts was busted for homicide , it was sidney who took rise and jesse to the jail ( " iron city " ) to see the fate in store for their former friend . more problems crop up in the neighborhood ; rise , seeing a chance to leave harlem wants to call jesse and the counts together for a final goodbye . sadly , that goodbye really was the end . this is an excellent book that reflects the city and street culture well . the characters are fresh , cutting edge , serious and believable . the drawings were excellent and a bonus to this book . jesse , an aspiring cartoonist created two west indian charcters , a wise man and a bird . the bird was a metaphor for jesse and it is through this avian character that he asks questions in his drawings that wise answers . myers has written many excellent books , but i think he really outdid himself with this one
dvd pos 378.txt truly frightening , gruesome , a gore-fest , a bloodbath , and it has a plot.. . really , there are a lot of clichï¿½ expressions to describe this movie but they 're all true : it 's a horror movie in the true sense of the word . i had n't seen a rob zombie movie before this one , but i would have to say , after seeing it , that it 's got to be his masterpiece . i do n't see how he could top it . " house of 1000 corpses " is not a movie that people who do n't like the genre should be watching . i do n't think they 'd be able to stomach it . it 's a downward spiral of evil , depredation , degradation and mayhem out of an imagination that must be really sick ( but awesome ) . the sense of humor in the movie actually does n't spoil it , it just makes it better , it 's so malicious . the atmosphere , the acting , the special effects and makeup , everything contributes to an hour-and-a-half long ride through a freak show that should n't be missed by true horror-movie buffs . buy it , rent it , whatever . if you love being scared , you 'll love this movie . it delivers !
camera pos 772.txt i bought this camera for my girlfriend and she loves it . it has all the basic functions her older coolpix had abut more and they 're a bit more user friendly . pros : compact and easy to hold . i 've had a few other point and shoots and they feel like they are going to jump out of my hand . this one feels pretty good . cons : before buying i read the reviews and a few were stating that the focus was not everything it should be . i will agree . that is the cameras only real big down fall . though my girlfriend may not notice it so much , to me it 's a little more aparant . for the most part , overall i really like this little guy. .
books pos 170.txt i really enjoyed this book . i found it in a bookstore one day and read it for pleasure slowly . i am a theory student ( now ) so i wanted to see a lot more math , but aside from that shortcoming ( which some might welcome ) it was just a fantastic description of fluid motion and derivations of the governing equations on a simple level .

software neg 884.txt do n't be fooled by the box saying how many they 've sold anyone who knows anything about software knows you cannot return an opened software box so sold means nothing . this software in unimpressive , i bought it because i needed to do my wedding invitation and i liked the description thinking i could use it for may other things as well . well i ended up using word for my invitations , yes word , why because word actually did everything i wanted that this program said it would do but did n't ! i spent hours trying to use it 's " simple " templates to no avail they would not print correctly or in the size they claimed to be . in the end i am out the money i spent and pretty mad about it
music neg 557.txt van dyke parks did the arrangements on sam phillips 's debut ' the indescribable wow ' , an album i love so much i thought i 'd give ' song cycle ' a shot . what a feeerocious disappointment ! i 'd give it zero stars if i could , but amazon would n't let me ! my god , that singing voice of his reminds me of david bowie.. . " the laughing gnome " bowie , that is.. . i 've seen the word " coy " pop up in a lot of reviews to describe his singing , er , style , but i 'll go them all one better.. . " smug " . all i hear in it is " ooh , i 'm so smart . what a clever lad am i . " the arrangements or orchestrations , or whatever you call them are all pointless . it gives me the feeling that van 's dad bought him an orchestra and said , " here , son , have fun . " so young van did.. . without ever really learning how to use it properly . randy newman knows how to use an orchestra ; check out his best album ' sail away' . the arrangements are tasteful and , key word here , spare . he never clubs us over the head with them . the lyrics , if we can call them such , have no attachment whatsoever to the music... . but then again since i wrote that the arrangments are pointless i guess it 's to be expected . so , what we have is a trifecta of awfulness : bad voice , bad lyrics , and bad music . however , he did make ' song cycle ' in 1968 and worked on ' the indescribable wow ' in 1988... so he did learn a thing or two in 20 years , namely that arrangements are not songs ; they 're used to highlight a certain verse or chorus the singer really wants to put across to the listener.. . maybe randy pulled him aside once to tell him that.. .

camera pos 73.txt many great things have already been said about this lens , and i will support them ! my copy delivers outstanding sharpness ( nearly on par with my 24-70l ) even *wide open* ( rare for a wide angle of all but the finest german manufacturers ) , great color , very little distortion ( many objective tests have revealed that it 's probably the " best of breed " ultra wide angle ) , and impressive contrast . surprisingly , the build quality is not bad : tight fitting mount , damped rings , and no jiggles or rattles . if i were forced to offer a ( slight ) negative , it would be the bokeh of the lens is somewhat " marbly " ...however , when shooting a subject with an oof area differential high enough to make bokeh a component of the frame , then the subject is likely going to demand far more attention than the bokeh ! ; ) a fine lens , canon : definitely worth the premium over the sigma and tokina rivals ( both of which i sampled before purchasing this optic )

software pos 310.txt ok , it is big ( 4 cdrs ) . and a full install will require over 2.35 gb . but it loads quickly and offers nice greeting card variety along with pretty sophisticated card customization options on all pages of the card . as in previous years , it also installs event planner . if you do n't want to use event planner you can stop it from starting with windows by going to start / all programs / startup group and deleting the entry for event planner from the startup group but if you do n't have a similar program , you might find event planner to be useful . i found setting up this program for my auto-duplexing ricoh color laser printer easy enough to do , so setting it up for other printers will likely be pretty easy also . the quality of the printed cards is really astounding , even my normally " picky " wife thinks they look very nice and acceptable for any use . i suppose your results could depend on your printer but if your printer currently prints nice graphics and pictures , then the cards should turn out very nice . i recommend using heavy card stock for a professional looking final product . cards that default to printing out in the 1 / 4 sheet size ( four fold ) format can easily be printed at 1 / 2 fold size and the graphics and text remain outstanding . i never experimented with the " partial install " that would require disk swapping but save hd space , so i cannot if that would be a nuisance or not . overall , there is nothing i 've found about the program that i do n't like .

camera pos 444.txt after buying this camera i was pleased for the most part , as the interface is extremely simple and the picture quality is very good . it 's a sleek , smooth design with minimal buttons , thus little confusion . there are 3 things , however , that i 'm not happy with . one is that it takes double a batteries , and eats them up really fast . the second thing is that there 's no secondary viewfinder , just the lcd screen . the lcd screen is large , which is great. . but this is why the battery life is so low . you ca n't turn the lcd screen off , so batteries go fast . the third and final thing i dislike about it is that there 's no ac adaptor , so whenever you plug your camera into the computer or the tv , not using it to take pictures , you have to run it on batteries . that is , unless you somehow find a compatible 3 volt ac plug , which is neither on the vivitar website , or anywhere else online that i can find made specifically for this camera . i 'm a little upset that it came with no adapter , as that would be so useful for a camera that eats up batteries . i reccomend rechargibles if you 're going to get this camera

books pos 768.txt this book provides a good and clear overview of the subject of mysql . this is a thick book that covers a lot of material . the last chapters even provided introductions to application development with c , perl and php . mysql : the complete reference really seemed like an actual complete reference . while it may not go to deep into every subject it does at least briefly cover each topic . most of the focus was on sql ( structured query language ) though . there were only a few minor issues with this book aside from minor grammatical errors . for one thing , you would occasionally have to modify the sample tables before you could even start the exercise . also , it would have been nice having more sample tables and data so i could follow along in more of the examples . frequently , my result set would n't quite match the one in the book . additionally , some of the command would n't even execute or would return an error message . lastly , the chapters on development were pretty useless unless you are already familiar with one of the languages . but , i believe many of the above problems where because of version differences and the fact that i was running mysql on windows . although windows instructions were given as well the book examples were still more oriented towards a unix installation . also , mysql would be several versions newer on my computer . i believe that made a difference on some of the results as well . and for windows administration its better just to use one of the suggested gui programs since many of the commands were difficult to run from the command prompt . so , i was n't quite able to follow along with all the examples for one reason or another . nevertheless , there were still plenty of quality examples i could follow along in . in addition , there was still a lot to learn from just reading through the material . overall , this book works well as a reference or for working the chapters in order . even though the book 's user level is n't indicated i believe it provides a fine introduction for a beginner .

camera pos 675.txt this is my third digital camera and by far my favorite . i purchased after having a very versatile but large ( well large in the dimensions of digital cameras ) digital camera . i needed and wanted a camera that i could easily carry w / me at all times . this is perfect . the fugi z1 fits easily into your pocket or a small case for easy access . just do n't put anything else in that pocket ! the one time i forget and did this i noticed a large scratch on the silver portion of the camera . as with all digital cameras this one takes much better pictures in good lighting . i have found , however , that this tiny camera has an excellent flash so i am still able to get good interior shots if i am willing to blind people ( or my cats ) for a few seconds . the camera comes w / a docking station that i have found very useless for uploading pictures but you have to use it to charge the camera . i tend to just use a usb cable direct to the computer or a really cheap usb card reader that i can attach directly to my computers usb port . i took this camera to japan and it was great . i only had one day where i ran out of battery power but that was my own fault . this is a highly recommended camera by me

music neg 180.txt i would have to say that there is nothing whatsoever wrong with the band jet , but when you do n't have any particular characteristics to call your own , there 's nothing to complain about . of course , this means that there 's nothing to compliment , either..except maybe that they do an excellent job sounding a hell of a lot like too many other bands . people compliment them on bringing the ' old ' and adding the ' new.. . ' but i hear nothing new in their music . it 's just ordinary , clichï¿½d classic rock , except for some reason no one told them that the classic rock era was about 40 years ago . if i want to listen to classic rock , i want to hear it on the classic rock stations , not the modern rock stations . those are for the new songs , only . an indepth and entertaining review of this album can be found at the pitchfork media website...i ca n't post the link due to strict review guidelines .
music neg 428.txt i was anxious to hear an astounding modern yet retro dance disc from one of my favorite girl groups of the 80s . unfortunately , instead of picking up on the latest influence of 80s music in dance music , what we get here is predominantly disco flavored tracks that sound painfully dated , with some latin tones now and then . the only semi retro / electro tracks on here ( and my favorites ) are feel for you , love bite , your love is like a drug , and marc almond 's remix of venus . the two lead singles " move in my direction " and " look on the floor " are not even the strongest tracks ! and the remixes on their singles do n't make them much better . i appreciate the commercial direction the girls have taken , but you can still sound mainstream while being more sophisticated than this . take a listen to the new madonna or even the kelly osbourne ( ! ) to hear some infectious melodies with an 80s flair that do n't melt down into total cheese . unfortunately , i just do n't see us radio embracing any of the sounds on this disc . but of course , fans of bananarama should still add this one to their collection . it 's listenable , if not up to today 's standards
camera neg 727.txt i purchased this camera and took it to the beach . the photos were so bad , i threw them away . the images were all washed-out and blurry . also , the film advancing mechanism is very tricky , so several of the pictures i took overlapped each other . i 've used other disposable cameras before that would n't let you take a picture until the film had been fully advanced to the next frame . with this camera , i advanced the film until the mechanism stopped , and the camera allowed me to take another picture . unfortunately , the film had n't advanced fully and the next picture partially overlapped the previous picture that i had taken . what a waste of money this camera was ! thankfully , i had also taken my digital camera , so i still had some good pictures of my trip : )
music neg 288.txt he was at his best when he sang about the loneliness , perseverance and dreams of ordinary people . in " sandra " for instance it felt like he was singing about a neighbour . the combination of his warm voice with his piano could be very moving and was definitely unique . in the late eighties he started focusing on merely performing and doing cover versions . he released a few inspired tracks now and then , his first christmas album had a lot of charisma and warmth , and " here at the mayflower " was a sincere effort . he is an intelligent person who cares for music and does n't let his superstardom go to his head . so , what has changed ? and why this late in his career ? barry has reinvented himself as a las vegas entertainer , liberace style . and he 's released an album with unchallenging versions of evergreens . i have no doubt that he genuinely wants to make people happy , like liberace did . and i have deep respect for that . but i personally regret that clive davis and manilow have now decided to manufacture products for a larger audience - one that does n't really have any demands .

'armed & dangerous ' sdtk 1986 ) . the single version of ' got to be real ' is fine because it includes cheryl 's trademark " soo-hoo , soo-hoo " vocal break that 's absent on the longer album version . all in all , i 'd recommend this cd to anybody that wants the best cheryl lynn compilation , but serious fans will want more ! ! ' the best of cheryl lynn , vol.2 ' has been long overdue for years , but you may have to make that one yourself until rhino does the job ! peace , sd ( of ' chaka 's world ' )
software neg 104.txt i was very disappointed with this program . but i was also thinking it would be more comprehensive and include more than just basic words and phrases . even so , the male and female guides in the program often pronounce the words slightly different which can be frustrating . i learned more icelandic ( along with correct pronounciations ) while in iceland than i did with this program . and besides , anyone under the age of 50 in iceland speaks english

music pos 520.txt this is one of the truly great handel opera recordings of the last twenty years . as usual , nicholas mcgegan proves himself to be one of the two or three greatest handelian conductors of our time . the singing from beginning to end is first class . this opera is known for the famous largo " ombra mai fu , " but the music in this entire performance is a sheer delight
health pos 562.txt a good product , to be sure...i 've used seventh generation 's other laundry detergents and have been very pleased . this " review " is however a cautionary : while it states on amazon that each bottle cleans 40 loads , it is only rated for 18 loads . just a heads up !

camera pos 560.txt i have been using the fuji e550 for almnost two years , with none of the problems that have been reported by some of the reviewers . here are the negatives : 1 ) the flash has mediocre range and is a little finicky . if you do n't depress the shooting button all the way , it may not flash . 2 ) in bright light , the screen on the back is unusable - it washes out the image . but the camera has a fine viewfinder so this is not really a major issue . the positives : 1 ) it takes great pictures . really excellent . 2 ) it 's small , and easy to carry . 3 ) the controls are well thought out and positioned on the camera body . very easy to use . 4 ) it has several automatic modes - sports , landscapes , portrait , etc , or you can use it on manual . i always use one of the programmed modes . 5 ) the video option is not bad at all - my twelve year old ( now 13 ) uses it . i was so pleased with this camera i bought one for my administrative assistant about ten months ago , and she is very happy with it . at it 's current price i think this camera is a bargain . only reason i did n't give it five stars is because of the weak flash .

camera pos 687.txt well , i 'm just amazed this model is still in production the way things are changing so quickly in the a / v world . i bought mine two years ago and have recorded many hours of my children as they are growing up . this is a truly low maintenance and low cost solution for your video recording needs if you do n't have a lot of money to spend on a digital set-up . just buy and extra after market battery or two ( and they 're cheap ) and some inexpensive analogue tape , and start recording away ! after you climb the learning curve , of course . my one problem with this camcorder is that the controls are anything but intuitive , and they 're splattered all over the unit . be sure to read the user manual carefully before you try to use this thing , but once you 've got it down you 'll find this a trusty and low cost companion for your family vacations and holidays . oh yeah , almost forgot , the microphones are n't stereo but they 're really quite good for an entry level unit
software neg 741.txt i 've installed and tested this for several clients . whether backing up to a local hd or over the network , the system has worked ; i install and come back a week later to do a test verify and restore , and it 's always worked . i did have trouble once ; windows froze up . this was probably due to poor programming combined with insufficient ram ; it worked the second time . i do n't get why a product with mostly single star ratings like this still gets 2.5 stars . annoying amazon ' feature ' ! since 60% of windows pcs are malware-infected , i 'm figuring most windows pc support issues are malware-induced .

software pos 643.txt nero 6 is a wonderful product , but you need to get a legal copy of the full retail version , not an oem cd or a cd of questionable origin . at this time ( april 2006 ) the best place to get it is from the ahead software website ( the makers of nero ) . ( you can get a retail box of nero 7 just about anywhere , but nero 6.6 seems to be more stable and provides all the functionality most users will need . ) you can download a demo , then purchase a serial number to unlock the full product . it 's a smooth , easy transaction . after many headaches i discovered that the oem version that came with my dvd burner would allow me to capture video from my camcorder , but would n't let me burn them to dvds . my choice was to either buy a cd of questionable origin ( and one that is almost certifiably illegal ) on ebay , purchase a dvd burning plug-in from ahead software for $24.99 , or purchase the whole suite for $80.00. i chose the latter . using my installed oem version , i purchased the serial number , entered it into the product ( very easy to do ) , then downloaded the latest updates , and i was off and running . this software produces very high quality dvds and can burn a disk in 15 to 20 minutes using an inexpensive 16x nec dvd burner . i am now a happy consumer with a stack of dvds containing transferred videos of great quality

music neg 267.txt shannon lawson is capable of a much better album . i saw him down in nashville when he was with the galoots , and it was amazing ! if they were to put out a cd i 'm sure it would be one of my favorites . shannon has a voice and a talent for bluegrass music and that 's what nashville should have let him do on his first solo cd . instead they gave it this generic , overproduced sound , leaving shannon sound like everyone else . with the way bluegrass is selling these days , it 's a shame that shannon could n't showcase his enormous talent in the proper arena. .

books neg 320.txt while it 's certainly true that there will always be a gulf between reality and words , communication between reader and writer is nonetheless very real and potentially profound , thanks in no small part to empathy and the imagination . deconstructionism , by denying presence and instead proposing unlimited differences between signs , dismisses any connection between readers and writers and turns language into a hermetic system separated from the outside world which is , of course , inhabited by people who read and people who write . this is exactly what makes deconstructionism so empty and hypocritical : it rejects traditional metaphysics while adopting a pseudo-mystical position which regards language as some unstable and solipsistic alien creature independent of everything and everyone
camera pos 754.txt i made the decision to buy this camera based on the many very positive user reviews . it replaces a six year old 2.1 megapixel camera . i am not disappointed . amazon 's price is very good for a 7.1 megapixel camera with a boatload of features . it is also considerably lighter in weight than the older camera . later i read reviews by experts who give it only mediocre scores for picture quality . they criticize it for no image stabilization leading to blur ( especially at higher power zoom ) and " noise " at film speeds over 100 asa . i set up a couple of situations in which both problems should have been very apparent . then i enlarged smaller portions of the frames to print inexpensive 4 x 6 test photos . had i printed the full frame , the print would have been larger than an 8 x 10. i just do not see the problems the experts criticize . the colors are rich and vibrant . i really appreciate the wide range of controls . the user can choose a from a number of modes fitted to various situations . these result in a faster shutter speed , or more depth of field , or fill-in flash , etc. it is not necessary to memorize the tiny icons on the selector dial . an on-screen prompt tells you what each mode does . i also like the amount of control in the manual mode . the user can choose the asa rating , shutter speed , apeture opening , and electronic flash mode . the manual tells how to set the camera for special situations , like photographing documents . when you take the picture , the through the lens screen goes black for part of a second . you know the picture has been taken , unlike a camera with an optical finder . the camera is very intuitive for first time use . i also read most of the manual on-line while waiting for delivery and handled the camera several times in a local discount store . when i first installed the software i restarted the computer , but it repeatedly would not recognize the camera . i switched to another usb cord and it worked fine immediately . then it also began to work with the original usb cord . i had even checked for a loose connection . who knows what that was about ! one little thing to keep in mind is this . if the camera is set on continuous auto focus , you can aim and shoot . if it is set on one-time auto focus , you must press the shutter halfway down and wait for the green light before shooting , if you want sharp pictures . i do not know , but expect the difference is battery life . a 1 gb memory card can store 485 pictures at the 7.1 megapixel resolution

books neg 913.txt let 's make this clear.. . i wo n't put any more effort into writing this review than the author spent on the book itself . so this is going to be short and sweet ! this book is a glorified magazine . worth $14.95 - tops . the pitfalls of bookbuying online , i guess . you never know what you are going to get . anyways , most the book comprises photographs that actually discourage me from bothering with infrared . the text portion , however brief , is nothing more than a bland introduction to infrared . the uninitiated might even be led to believe that kodak and konica are the only game in town in infrared films . throughout the book the author treats these two as the & quot ; coke and pepsi&quot ; of infrared films . i 'm going to look elsewhere for a good source of info on this subject and suggest you do the same

software pos 186.txt if you decide to buy a current greeting card program , there are really only two front-line choices : art explosion greeting card factory ( currently version 5 ) or hallmark card studio ( currently 2006 ) . there are other programs available specifically for creating cards , but most of them are low quality and outdated , and are n't really worth considering . ( a competitive third product featuring american greetings designs is sadly now long outdated ; the designs in the american greetings program were of similar quality to those in the hallmark package ) . so how do these two products match up ? without a question , if you are looking for quality " canned " cards , the hallmark program wins . the hallmark designs are professional , and are equal in quality to cards you would purchase in a store . in contrast , the designs in art explosion are adequate but surely not up to the quality of a store-bought card . the hallmark program is also able to simply and correctly print to several different types of card store ( although you are stuck with the choices pre-programmed into the software unless you want much frustration ) . the art explosion does a poorer job of correctly and simply printing to a variety of card stock and configurations . art explosion beats the hallmark program in editing options ( more extensive ) , and in the amount of additional art ( clipart , etc. ) included with the package . if you do not plan to use the " canned " cards , then i would recommend art explosion . but the average user will likely appreciate the professional , high quality cards in the hallmark package . personally , i consider the choice of the hallmark package over art explosion a no brainer . a note on versions : the publisher comes out with a new version of the hallmark program every year ( 2003 , 2004 , 2005 , 2006 , etc. ) and the same is true for art explosion greeting card factory . having used many of these versions , i find very little reason to recommend upgrading year by year . disappointingly , the stock cards in the hallmark program do not seem to have changed appreciably in many years , and the same is true for art explosion .

dvd neg 166.txt " the door in the floor " is difficult to like , even , ( or perhaps especially ) , if you 're a fan of john irving 's book , " a widow for one year , " which was the source of this film . the movie is dark , depressing , & slow-moving . it also showcases the least likable characters from the book . to make matters worse , it focuses only on the first third of the novel 's story , which leaves us with an entire movie about an alienated , ( & alienating ) , couple 's suffering . the film is completely devoid of the novel 's interesting & more enjoyable journey through this tragic period of a family 's life & into the more fulfilling chapters in the lives of characters who are n't well developed in the film , but who are central to the book 's satisfying end to an otherwise hopelessly sad story ! this may give you an idea why the film was n't very successful with audiences . the theme is of deep personal loss and the devastating effects it can have on people . unfortunately , the film version of the story concentrates almost entirely on the agony experienced by the parents , played by jeff bridges & kim basinger , in the aftermath of the accidental death of their two teenage sons . it wallows in the empty chasm that 's grown between them & delves into the sad , meaningless , & even cruel love affairs they each engage in , in vain attempts to ease their sorrows & escape the pain of the love lost between them & of course , the greatest loss , the loss of their sons . the film also highlights the rather ugly way this couple inflicts damage upon the people they use for this purpose . and finally , we witness the pain of their very young daughter , who was born out of yet more of the parent 's attempts to fill their empty , sad lives , and we 're treated to a view of her pitiful childhood , growing up with parents who truly " are n't there . " the greatest mystery for me is why the screenwriter chose to tell just a small slice of the story of this great novel , and even worse , why they chose to " bring to life " only the most depressing and frankly least interesting parts of it ! if the theme of loss is one you 're very interested in , you might find this movie quite affecting . as for me , a great fan of the book , i can only hope that someday someone makes a better & more complete adaptation of this great book . it 's not nearly as desperate & sad a story as this film version ! on subsequent viewings i 've grown to appreciate this film a bit more . taken completely apart from the novel , it 's not a " bad " film . undoubtedly , the performances are wonderful , however little fun they are to watch .
dvd neg 557.txt like many of the reviewers here , i am an anne rice fan . however , i knew that there were going to be liberties taken and was comfortable with them . i mean , few of the " dracula " movies throughout the years have had anything to do with bram stoker 's novel . all i wanted - and expected - was a flashy , no substance guilty pleasure movie , a la " dracula 2000. " that alone should tell you my expectations . but qotd failed even as a guilty pleasure . the storyline did n't make a lot of sense when taken on it 's own , and the acting was bad to bland . i also take issue with the badly-done look of the vampires . rice 's vampires are supposed to be beautiful , whereas this bunch looked like eurotrash or people at a halloween spook house . however , one good thing about this movie is the music videos for lestat . since the videos are included on the dvd , it earns 1 star

books pos 114.txt i expected a fabbo edge-of-the-seat read . what i did n't expect was that this pomo thriller would provide a passel of top-flight management secrets to its unsuspecting readers . from the opening pages of the book , as wylie jones prepares to depart on a & quot ; business trip&quot ; of unspecified duration , to the penultimate chapter , when a revitalized wylie and his attentive amanuensis wrap up a deal on the left coast , this beach-bag zinger is chock full with the sorts of advice , hints , tips , and warnings that help to build healthy management brains in twelve ways ! think of it as a kind of business allegory . wylie 's cross-country odyssey is what might happen if robert fulghum were to meet john gardner trundling down the road on his reality bike , set fire to robertson davies ' beard , and then move on over to the highway hacienda for corn dogs and a brew with none other than warren buffet , everyone 's favorite grassroots investor . i totally loved it . it gets my absolute highest rating
books pos 184.txt i am a huge john grisham fan . i believe the first grisham book i ever read was " the pelican brief " . after that , i was hooked . i admit that through the years mr. grisham 's work has become less " grishamisc " and not as entertaining as earlier works . but , you 'll have that with any author that cranks out as many books as he does . i first started this book by listening to it on cd . i soon decided that it would be more enjoyable to read it than listen to it . i was right ! the book starts out with action and pulls you in . the action barely lets up through the entire book . this is a different kind of action . more mental than physical . there seems to always be something going on and grisham knows how to leave you wanting more at the end of each chapter . one thing that is very different about this book than most of his works , is that there is n't really a catch at the end or a mystery to solve . generally , we find grisham leading us to a thriller ending . however , in this book , it is more of a life lesson about greed . there is no bad guy , nobody lurking in the shadows trying to harm the main character , etc. the book is about good old fashioned greed and how it can ruin your life . the characters are likeable and easy to follow . there are not too many needless chapters or boring detail that is irrelevant to the story . i found the book very easy to read and follow . i always wanted more . although the book has a different theme than most grisham books , i still really enjoyed it . it reminded me why i like to read his books so much . it proves he write good fiction without a thriller or mystery ending . if you like this one , try the eariler works as well . if you have seen the movies , it does n't matter because the books are always better and usually different in some way . this book would make a good movie , but we 'll see if anyone in hollywood agrees with me on that point . happy reading

health pos 395.txt i have read reveiws before i bought it that said the trimmer " pinches " or cut people , but i have n't found that to be the case . i would n't use it in ultra sensitive places ( but i try not to use anything sharp and potentially dangerous near sensitive areas ) but it does the trick quite well . i have really enjoyed it and think it functions really well for a good price . it also has an attachment to be a regukar shaver ( which was n't advertised when i bought it ) but worked well on my legs ; not as great as some more expensive electric leg shavers but is great when you do n't have much time . all in all i suggest buying it .
dvd pos 683.txt alec baldwin has always been the best host of snl ( along with walken and spacey ) and this makes a pretty good case why . the opening sketch with the press conference about prince charles is priceless . and what could be more demented than " canteen boy . " baldwin is so over-the-top in that that what is a really , really sick joke is actually funny . but the home runs come with three of the funniest sketches of all time : the tony bennet show ( i was seizing during this one ) , the joe pesci show ( with baldwin doing deniro ) and the " zinger " sketch , which just got funnier as it went along . even better was the voicemail sketch where he keep re-recording his greeting , only to listen back to it and hear a gay man . there are a couple of clunkers : " planet truth " was just not that funny and maybe two others did n't need to be here . including one so-so opening monologue that probably was only included because it included paul mccartney . the bonus features include one great sketch that never made it on-air , and a great audio track by baldwin and the producer of snl which provides lots of really , really entertaining stories about the cast and the sketches themselves . absolutely hilarious

camera neg 759.txt this is an awesome little camera . except that you ca n't use it at night ! there are horrible white spots in nighttime photos when the flash is used . apparently these appear because the flash is so close to the lens in this camera , and so dust reflects badly . it 's a known problem [...] also , it 's totally annoying that sony uses all their proprietary technology . as a result , the cable for connecting this camera to the computer is unwieldly ( uhh , have you heard of usb ? ? ! ! ) , and you have to buy a sony memory stick , which probably wo n't work with anything else you have . on the flipside , you can take movies that are n't limited to 30 seconds with this guy - i think that might be a result of the memory stick technology . but other than that , the design and operation of this little guy seems pretty slick . the lens is not one of those that pops out , so not sure if that affects image quality at all , but as far as i could tell , quality was good . in the end , what good is a camera that ca n't take usable pictures with its flash ? ?

dvd pos 882.txt 5 stars to the film itself ! here 's a painful study of a woman 's descent to lunacy amidst a desolate , uncaring and eventually foreboding backdrop of industrial waste . the character study is not unlike claustrophobic polanski 's repulsion but dwells on vitti 's being consumed by her external surroundings as opposed to deneuve 's intensive plunge to schizophrenia . the pace and landscape is virtual antonioni so it may not appeal to viewers who are not familiar with the director 's works . one of his greatest works ( l'avventura remains his best to me ) . the only problem is the dvd transfer . i 've seen the vhs and it has a consistent hue of orange . the dvd , although sharper and clearer , fluctuates in hues from blues in medium shots to reds and oranges in long shots . for a film that essentially deals with color ( it was antonioni 's first color feature ) , the transfer was rather clumsy and careless . the sound is average but leaves a lot of room for improvement . why did n't criterion handle the transfer of this gorgeous film

camera pos 653.txt i bought this camera to replace my 35 almost a couple years back . i am an avid nature photographer so most of my work is taken in the outdoors . after hundreds of pictures and all kinds of weather here 's the lowdown.. . pros ... picture quality is amazing even after zooming the full 10x ( i never go into digital zoom because of low quality of pictures , although this camera is n't too bad after complete full optical and digital zoom ) . prints that i 've made up to 16x20 " ( have n't gone larger , but i know i can ) are extremely impressive and are as crisp as viewing a 4x6. it is easy to use and the functions are easy to get to with the use of the joystick . the stabilization at full 10x zoom is incredible also . it appears really shaky through the window , but pictures continue to turn out crisp . close-ups are clear and reveal amazingly clear details . the movie feature works better indoors than the regular camera portion ( read cons ) . cons ... indoor shooting is limited because the flash is n't strong enough . when at a school chorus concert , the pictures turned out fuzzy and unclear . award ceremonies , the pictures turned out once again unusable in my standards . the zoom is fixed when using the movie feature so you need to have the zoom set before beginning a movie . this camera seems to eat batteries , especially in the winter months . i am always on the go , and when i go to pull out the camera i find the camera lens cover has fallen off yet again . it comes off way to easily causing smudges and smears on the lens so i must always have lens cleaner wipes on me . the viewing window cover has also come off and is lost in the woods somewhere , but that also is minor . most of the cons really are all minor things that do n't interfere with the amazing quality of the pictures as long as you are properly prepared for those minor issues . i tried to be as precise about this camera as possible . all in all , i would highly recommend this camera to the avid photographer . if you plan on using a camera on mostly indoor activities , just keep in mind for the flash to work good , keep your subjects close . it 's been bumped , jostled , and droped a couple of times and the camera still works like a gem

books neg 429.txt the plot of this book was interesting , and it could have been a good book . unfortunately , it wasn't . the main problem for me was that the hero is dispicable , and the heroine has absolutely no self esteem ! even many of the the secondary characters are weak , miserable people ! the story starts when the hero finds himself drawn to the heroine even though he considers her a " dirty little nobody " . once she gets a makeover and is actually beautiful , he begins pressuring her to become his mistress even though she is an innocent marriageable female by regency standards . because she is the daughter of a " cit " , he ca n't imagine why she has any reservations about the deal . he says charming things to her like " how much do you think your virginity is worth anyway " . now that 's romance ! meanwhile , even though she is unbelievably insulted by the hero many times , she finds herself drawn to him too . for me their relationship was sort of like an abuser and his victim . she never stood up for herself , and you felt sorry for her . of course the plot twist involves a mystery about her parentage.. . only its not really a mystery because almost everyone knows the hero is a dukes granddaughter , including her . in fact just about the only one who does n't know is the hero , which provides the dilemma . he would of course be willing to marry her if only he knew she really was n't a nobody ! will anyone tell him ? will he wise up and offer to marry her even though she is n't good enough for him ? will she give in to her desires and become his mistress since he does n't think she is good enough for him to marry ? of course it all works out , and he actually proposes to before he finds out she actually is good enough for him . ugh ! ! ! this could have been a good book if the " mystery " had been handled better , and the characters were written differently . as is , it is a sad regency tale

software pos 497.txt all in all a fine product . has gotten excellent reviews from pc mag . norton slowed my machine to a crawl . this has not . suggest never paying full retail for it unless you absolutely have to . i 've been using it for a few years now and always manage to find a free after rebate deal on it a few months before the one year subscription period is up . it does require the user to provide authorizations the first time it sees a programs attempting to access the web . for a non techie , this may seem a bit intimidating because there will be a lot of queries from it in the first few days of usage
software neg 433.txt everything the negative reviewers say is true and more . please note the following as well : 1. if you are a college student taking a class online that uses blackboard software , vista will prevent you from posting to the class discussion board and answering any fill-in-the-blank or discussion questions on tests ! to fix this download the foxfire browser ( free ) and use it to access your course . because vista uses so much memory and is already so huge , they had to drop quite a few little programs that software needs to access in the operating system . 2. huge memory and hard drive drain . look at this comparison windows xp professional size on drive 1.5 gig memory requirements 128 mb windows vista needs 15 gig to load . does not say how large the program is but i would n't think its small ! ! ! memory requirements 1 gig ! if you check the dell website you will see that they recommend that you have 2 gig of memory to use windows vista . that is a few $$$ worth of memory just to run the operating system while openning a program . try running a game or doing animation with that kind of a sink hole in your system ! the less memory you have available , the slower everything , including websites will load ( no matter how fast your internet connection ) what is worse is that to fix what is wrong with it ( ie replace all those small programs your software expects to find in the operating system ) , they will have to add patches that can only make it bigger and hungrier for memory ! this is the most pathetic excuse for an upgrade that i have ever seen . i would expect some lawsuits before this is over ! do not buy this product

software neg 411.txt after using turbotax couple of years and then using taxcut for last two years ( 2005 and 2006 returns ) i concluded that turbotax is much superior software . taxcut 's only advantage is that it is cheaper . if you take out price from the equation , taxcut is inferior in quality . - in 2005 taxcut software there was not pdf output of all the forms . this was pretty silly because after couple of years if i want to access my tax return i am not going to install taxcut again in my computer and view by return . i would rather have have my tax return available in some widely acceptable format like pdf and then access / distribute whenever i want ( i do n't keep my documents in hardcopies ) . so i wrote to h&r block . this year they added that saving return in pdf file feature available . but unfortunately , this is far from being perfect . it excludes number of important forms - example , irs form 8853 , california adjustment schedule 540ca etc. instead of that it saves numbers of useless worksheet ( without any data entered in those worksheets ) , same form multiple times . - most annoying thing about this software is updating incorrect data . in one form i entered wrong data . while reviewing it i found a problem and went to that specific section to update . but in calculation taxcut still showed old incorrect number . i just could not make it to use new corrected number . eventually i had to restart a new return from scratch - just to have an dollar amount corrected . - in many section useful helps are missing
camera pos 748.txt images from this camera are very high quality . the 18x optical zoom is very usable with only minimal distortion noticeable at the extremes . the optical image stabilization system ( based on stabilizing the ccd image sensor instead of lens elements ) is quite good and performed well under several different circumstances ( moving car , boat , shaky hands ) . my main gripe with this camera is the lack of high speed usb 2.0 support . the fine print says that the usb interface is " full speed " which means a maximum transfer rate of 12 mbit / s instead of the 480 mbit / s possible with high speed usb . so , downloading photos from the camera through the usb interface is painfully slow compared to most current generation digital cameras such as a canon sd900. the software provided with the camera is somewhat difficult to use and is slow and unresponsive . it would also be desirable if the camera could accept a lithium ion rechargeable battery in addition or instead of the 4 aa batteries it uses . but , battery life with both alkaline and rechargeable nimh aa batteries was adequate .

books neg 809.txt i only glanced through this book , yet my first impression is that it is a hodge podge of unrelated research without any attempt to analyze or comment on the results or even the quality of the research conducted or of the tools applied . i can , however , write about one of the editors , mike shaw , who made no attempt whatsoever to ' find the evidence ' when assessing us as parents . he works as a consultant child psychiatrist in london , england and seems to specialise in offering his services as an ' expert witness ' and trainer in the legal aspects of applying medical recommendations under the mental health act. we had our children taken away on the grounds that they were " at risk of neglect " . mike shaw was called in as an expert witness to interview us and make recommendations . yet the reports that he submitted to court were unbelievably sloppy and ill researched . under cross examination , he was vague and inarticulate and could provide no concrete evidence to support his assertions and recommendations . luckily for us , he was so glaringly incompetent that we were allowed to repeat the process with another expert psychiatrist . i do n't know about his co-editors , but if his work is anything to go by , the material that he collated in this book can only be equally sloppy and prejudiced . here are some extracts from the psychiatric report that he submitted to court . judge for yourself whether you can take anything this man does or says seriously . evidence-gathering . " on 9.8.02 , i interviewed mr & mrs orman [2 hours] " on 21.8.02 , i met the family at trent park where i spoke to mrs orman alone [40 mins] , witnessed contact [1 hour] and spoke to the children without their parents [20 mins] [and] i interviewed the foster carer [2 hours]. observations . " mr & mrs orman were friendly and co-operative throughout.[...] mr orman showed insight [... but] was n't concerned that his actions may have disadvantaged the children . the couple were very robust in refuting the [welfare's ] account , which they claimed was full of misunderstandings and misinformation . " contact took place in the park[...]the parents and children seemed happy to see each other ; they chatted in animated style . [...] i was n't aware of either parent criticising the authorities in the children 's presence " [interviewing the children] the children seemed attentive [...] but answered " do n't know " , fell silent and looked at each other when i asked them questions [...] erin related [a simpsons episode where] homer [...] had lumps coming out of his head because he kept his anger inside . i found myself wondering whether this was an oblique reference to concern about mr orman 's temper but guessed that such an interpretation would be dismissed . [note . this is submitted in court as an evidence-based legal document ! ] conclusions & recommendations " [...] i observed mrs orman as shy and anxious while mr orman was very pleasant but forceful . [...] " mr and mrs orman say they have an easy affectionate bond with the children . so it is surprising that the foster carer finds the children uncomfortable with physical contact . [...] i think there is some insecurity in the children 's attachment to their parents . [note how this directly contradicts his own observations in the park.] " were mr orman to be caring for the children on his own , i would be concerned about his sensitivity to their needs . [...] asked whether he had any regrets , mr orman did n't take any responsibility for the deprivation and disruption suffered by his children going into care . [...] erin [who was 8 at the time] needs a parent who can stand up to her without losing their temper , and support and advise socially . i suspect mr orman would find this difficult . " my concern about mrs orman managing the children on her own would be a recurrence of her illness . [...] i wonder whether mrs orman has the strength and patience to handle these very challenging [sic] children . " [...]the children seemed very happy and natural with their parents during the contact i observed [sic] and the contact records make reference to the children wanting to go home . " [...] returning home is likely to further retard the children 's social and emotional development . [...] " these children have very little capacity to protect themselves from what is essentially emotional deprivation and possibly abuse . [...] it is most unlikely that either parent can protect the children from any harm that the other parent might cause . i also find very plausible ms [charlotte] curran 's suggestion ( ... [in] her [written] statement ) that mr orman dominates his wife . " the children did not express a wish to return home when they spoke to me , but it seems safest to assume they would prefer to be at home and would be alarmed if that was not possible . [..] i believe the children need a long-term placement away from home with experienced foster carers . [...] contact should be gradually reduced . " mike shaw 's answers under cross-examination painted a dire picture of our mental competence and subsequent parenting abilities , but he was unable to point to any specific evidence that he had acquired in his 6-hour investigation . yet he remained adamant in his conclusion that the children should be removed from the family indefinitely and contact gradually reduced until no further contact be allowed , so that the children could lead a normal and happy life . he could not comment on government statistics that show that 70% of all children placed in long-term foster care end up as delinquents . our children were eventually returned to us after we underwent a convoluted process to prove our competence as parents beyond a reasonable doubt ; and the case was eventually closed . so much for the scientific and critical appraisal of our family by a man who regularly provides expert legal evidence and trains psychiatrists in making competent medical recommendations that supposedly satisfy basic human rights conventions
camera pos 841.txt i would like to add to the reviews already posted , especially for anyone considering this lens as an alternative to the 80-400 vr . this is one of the only times i can remember when i have had the money to buy a nikon lens , but have not been able to bring myself to do it . the 80-400 is 6 years old , uses ancient mechanical ( slow ) focus , and has yet to be updated with vrii technology . all that , and it still costs more than the pro-quality canon 100-400 is , which has canon 's af-s equivalent too ! that said , i like long yet portable lenses , and after giving myself fits decided to " settle " for the 70-300 because it has vrii and af-s . if you are in the same boat then buy this lens , it is a gem for its intended purpose . i get sharp results wide open at 300 , and the light weight more than offsets the slower apertures . i would have loved this lens if it was an f / 3.5 , but even at 4.5-5.6 i have really been surprised at the results . save the $1000+ until nikon updates the 80-400 dinosaur

books pos 289.txt when i was in the sixth grade we moved twice , and in all three of the schools from new jersey to connecticut to japan i got to study ancient greece in the history part of the class . i also got a lot of mileage out of having read edith hamilton 's " mythology " ( i still have my mythology report with my versions of all of the illustrations ) . but in all the times i got to study ancient greece before , during , and after the sixth grade i never got to do any of the fun stuff that avery hart & paul mantell come up with for " ancient greece ! : 40 hands-on activities to experience this wondrous age . " this kaleidoscope kids volume for kids ages 7-12 not only offers activities but also a variety of information about the ancient greeks . so this is not simply a book of activities that teachers can pick and choose from to give their students hands-on experiences , it is also a source of facts and stories that will supplement what exists in whatever textbook is being used . throughout the book there are " great greeks ! " and things to " think about . " after reminding young readers of the gifts that have come down to us from ancient greece , hart and mantell get students acclimated to the idea of looking at the past from the perspective of those who lived way back when . then the book looks at key periods of greek history . " meet the minoans : the pre-greeks of crete " looks at the culture that gave rise to the greatness of greece with activities to make a greek yo-yo , a great mother figure , a hamster labyrinth ( without the minotaur ) , and a fantastic fresco . that gives you an indication of the sort of activities to be found in this book before we even get to greece itself . other chapters are devoted to " the age of heroes , " where you get a super-short version of " the iliad " and can build a trojan horse , " language unites ! " ( including speaking " pig greek " ) , " the dawn of a golden age , " where you can organize a pentathlon and make a victory wreath , and " ye gods ! greek religion and mythology , " where you can design your own constellation . in the last part of the book chapters cover " classical athens : the flower of ancient civilization , " where you get to build a greek temple with ionic columns ( or even build the entire parthenon ) , " think for yourself : philosophy , " where students can make a monochord or hold a symposium , and " the amazing arts , " which covers create sculptures and painting pots in the first part and making masks to make up a greek play in the second part . the final chapter covers " a wider world : alexander the great and the hellenistic age , " where you can start a library . at the end , students can appreciate how being a greek meant standing in the center of the world ( as least , as far as the ancient greeks were concerned ) . again , there are some key issues to be discussed to go along with the activities . students can debate what is the difference between a hero and a celebrity , understand why every vote counts in a democracy , and decide what makes somebody beautiful . learning how to press olives or how huge blocks of marble were transported across the sea , gives students an appreciation for how things were different way back when . throughout the book hart and mantell show how ancient ideas live on in modern traditions , which remains the biggest legacy of the ancient greeks . i teach classical greek & roman mythology ( not to be confused with modern greek & roman mythology apparently ) but i teach it online so i do not really have any opportunities to have my students engage in hands-on activities . but that does not mean i cannot do them in the privacy of my own home or that elementary school teachers will not find these extremely useful for their unit on ancient greece . although i am suddenly reminded of coming up with the " sparthens " ( a.k.a. the warriors with the brains ) in elementary school . but that is another story

dvd pos 831.txt dmx stars as the drug dealer king david , who pops up in the streets again after a long absence . rolling into the frame in a player 's classic - a late 70 's stutz blackhawk - king david shrugs his way back into the hard-knock life . he quickly reaps what he sows and , mortally wounded , passes all his worldly goods to paul ( david arquette ) , a scrambling white would-be writer . king david 's estate includes an audio journal of his life , which provides flashbacks and a narrative-within-a-narrative that answers the shaken paul 's curiosity . it 's the highlights of king david 's high life that propel " alone . " like all of goines 's heroes , king david is a scourge on the periphery , and the movie dramatizes his corrosive effect on the margins with savvy muscularity . every life he touches he leaves in ruins - a need to deface beauty as a result of self-loathing is implicit , and dmx signals that motivation with sly hostility . to say that king david is the best part he 's ever had is an understatement ; he has never felt the need to inhabit a movie in this way before . i would recomed this to anyone who likes the hip hop lifestyle or music and for anyone who like films with a twist

software neg 495.txt if one is looking for an educational program to help a child learn there are much better programs on the market than mia . unfortunately we bought this as a package of mia and all suffer from the same issues . first , it takes 2 cds and a game cannot be completed without switching to the 2d cd . that compounds the problem that mia cannot be loaded on the hard drive so the game cannot be played unless the cd is loaded . having programs that require the loading of cds to play them is a pain in the neck because children do not handle cds properly and an adult must change the cds . most programs have only one cd but this one requires two . mia programs are more like video games than educational software . they are comparable to video games like spiderman and sponge bob which are puzzles to be solved . that is the problem with the mia programs . the child spends an inordinate amount of time manuevering between the educational activities so that most of the time is spent manuevering and little time is spent on education . and it can be frustrating for the child , even a child that is very adept at video games . yet because mia is more of a video game than an educational resource , children who are video game geeks like mia . mia 's science is better than mia 's math and reading because at least a written scenario is provided which helps out . but like all the mia programs , the program hangs at times so that the child cannot complete the game . worse yet because the program is always active , the hibernation and suspend operations on the computer do not function so the program must be shut down should the child leave the computer . another problem that all the mia programs suffer from is that the video only occupies a small part of the monitor screen so that the effects are dimished . other educational software fill the full screen although to mia 's credit , when the user exits the program it restores the screen to its original resolution , something not all educational softwere does . the mia programs do have humor in them which is enertaining to children and what educational material there is , is somewhat useful . the game is very lengthy . it takes hours to complete a mission . the oral instructions do not always match the written ones which are the correct ones , and are confusing to children . as the game progresses , lag time increases between segments
dvd pos 856.txt i stumbled across this movie on cable a couple of years ago , having nothing better to do i watched it . my first impression was that it would be just another stoner movie were nothing really happens . i was suprised though because not only does it have a plot it has a interesting plot . you do n't have to be stoned , or even a stoner to enjoy this movie . one reveiwer said somthing along the lines of it looking like grade school kids made it . well it is true it was an independent film made on the cheep but think it actualy adds something to the over all feel of the film , like your actualy there , scrapping through life with the characters . i guess i can understand why some people wouldnt get this movie , not enough bells and whisels , but if your up for something differnt give it a try . by the way , the movie was based on a book of the same name , also very good and differnt

camera neg 205.txt i admit that i 'm far from an expert on digital cameras . i did take over 32 , 000 photographs with 35mm cameras for over 20 years . i purchased a 510 powershot in july of 2005. it was n't too long before the zoom on the cameras lens would n't work . i contacted canon over this and can you believe this company had the audacity to charge me for shipping their faulty camera back to them . i can understand them saying , ' we 'll charge you at first , but once we establish that the fault is due to us , we 'll then reimburse you back . ' i enclosed a type written letter with the camera asking that canon contact me when they received my camera ( in the mail ) and i also asked that they contact me when it was being shipped back . ( i also emailed them the same request ) . neither of my wishes was ever fulfilled on canon 's behalf . that in itself was enough for me and i 've been bitter about that ever since . i 've also told every person that i 've met who wanted to buy a digital camera about this incident . i 'm pleased to say , i 've steered most away from this company . what else can i say about this camera : this camera is slow at times after its taken a picture . i 've missed out on some good shots due to this . it eats batteries like there 's no tomorrow so one must have rechargeable aa 's to even make this camera worth its while . i 've not used other digital cameras so maybe they are all this way but if i take a 3 minute movie ( with this camera ) in my home during the day and go outside , most things outside are very white . almost like looking at an infra red photograph . when filming outside , when one goes inside during the day , everything is dark . like i said , maybe all digital cameras are this way ? i would n't recommend this camera or anything that canon makes if you want my personal opinion . think about that . you have to pay the shipping for a camera that 's barely a few months old and still under warranty . that 's disgusting , that 's all i have to say . there should be a zero for this , not a 1 star

camera neg 28.txt at 300mm this lens is very soft , it 's hard to get a shot that looks like it 's in focus . to do so , you need to shoot at about f / 11 , and then since there is little light available , you usually have to bump the iso to 800 or 1600 just to get an acceptable shutter speed . of course , the high iso then introduces other artifacts . the focus is also dead slow and often does n't lock on . this is a lens that i have constantly fought with . do n't upgrade to the new 70-300 is either , as it 's only marginally better . buy the 70-200 f / 4l . it 's a far superior lens
software pos 602.txt product is excellent does what it says and then some . instruction for installation and operating are very easy to follow ( a winner in my book ) . i had issues unrelated to this product running into problems with the stereo i was using in the fact that it did n't have outputs for audio so i was forced to use the headphone jack which required further purchasing adapters for the rca cable was a bit frustrating but had nothing to do with this product . i converted 2 albums last night into wav files cleaned them up with the audio cleaner included in the software . used the editing ripper included to split the 1 recording into separate tracks , actually the software does that for you but you have the option to preview there start and ending points for each of the tracks in case it may be off . i only had minor adjustments the ripper was pretty much on the money , overall . i then downloaded the encoder recommended to work with this software and converted the wav files into mp3 's with no problem . this is an excellent buy for those out there looking to do there own audio transfer of lp 's and cassettes . the sound is excellent on playback .

music neg 139.txt can it be that people are letting their personal beliefs block the receptors in the brain that signal bad music ? ive listened to many bob dylan albums , and every one is a gem . freewheelin ' is my favorite , but so what ? it does n't matter which ones we love , because we all know what bob dylan 's worst record was , and its saved . im not one to question this man 's beliefs or anything like that , bob dylan deserves all the respect in the universe , but could it be that bob dylan made a transfer to christian music to help us all see how bad it is ? could he have made the transfer to make a mockery of the christian faith ? almost certainly not . but only a seriously bad album could have planted these seeds in my brain
dvd neg 657.txt *no spoilers* we had enough of lame japanese films . this new " wave " of horror movies like " the ring , " " pulse " and now " the grudge 2 " does n't seem to have an end . the genre is played out but that did n't stop the producers from creating this sequel which is a sad and incomprehensible follow-up of the decent 2004 first version . to understand this film- -which is nearly impossible until the end- -you would have to see the first movie . brief story : the film has basically three plots , but in a way they are connected to each other . the first plot is a follow-up of what happened to karen davis ( sara michele gellar ) who barely survived the ghosts of the haunted house . mrs. davis ( joanna cassidy ) asks her other daughter aubrey to investigate what happened to her sister karen . she travels to japan to bring sara home . now in japan , she finds her in the hospital very paranoid about the ghosts of the house , but something terrible is about to happen . the second plot is about three school girls who visit the haunted house . one of the girls has to go to the closet for some kind of initiation that we do n't know about . suddenly the girl sees the ghost of the child . she tries to get out but the door jammed . they all panic and leave the girl in the closet with the ghost . unfortunately , they are about to find out the hard way that the place was not to be visited . the third plot takes place in the us where a new family moves to an old building . a young kid suddenly notices that the building is haunted and the " strange lady " that lives next door has something to do with it . people are starting to act weird in this building because of the evil presence . review : less scary and sillier than the original , " the grudge 2 " takes you to a boring and confusion movie experience . the movie suffers from too many plots that confuse the audience rather than scare them . we have to wait until the end to find out how everything relates to each other . this time around the ghosts are outsourcing from japan to the us . they do n't care whether you visit the house or not . now these menaces are getting medieval to people for no apparent reason . these ghosts behave now like viruses that will haunt and kill whoever is on their way- -even a young little boy- -just to show their rage . the so-called scary moments are not scary at all . they are lame , mechanical and cheap imitations of the original 2004 first version . what 's sad is that , this time around , the writers have to make the actresses show some " skin " to please the male teen audience . this is what the filmmakers have to use to get some kind of momentum going for this movie . in the technical department the movie does n't do a good job either . the editing is very sloppy and extremely confusion . we have three plots that are poorly mixed together . sometimes we are in japan and sometimes the ghosts are outsourcing in the us . the photography of the film is identical to its predecessor , but that 's the only thing that resemblances the original . in the sound department , the movie will make you laugh . we hear sillier noises than the original . instead of getting scared , you might laugh at the sounds these ghosts make- -we personally like the angry " kitty " sound . the verdict : a terrible sequel of a decent horror film , " the grudge 2 " could have been a straight-to-video release if it was n't for the beautiful sara michelle gellar . no scary moments but many funny ones- -unintentionally , of course .
music neg 36.txt michael jackson is one of the most gifted songwriters / singers of our time . you can discuss his person , you can discuss his behaviour , and all the other stuff , but you ca n't really take that away from him . and that 's exactly why this album is so unacceptable , coming from someone like him - when you 've reached superstardom and gone beyond it , you do n't release a record that 's so horribly mixed up and full of second grade tracks that it 's bound to be a faliure . at least , you should expect to hear for it . and hear for it he did , cause the critics did n't go lightly on this one . and it 's not that bad , actually . i mean , that 's what i have my program function in my cd-player for , and my cd-burner . the album starts on a fair streak - unbreakable , heartbreaker and invincible - are all fair tracks - below average for mj , sounds like a watered down selection of discarded tracks from dangerous that were then discarded for history and then discarded for blood on the dance floor , and full of badly placed guest rappers to top it off - but apart from that , if you forget who made this music , these are actually good , funky dance tracks . for michael jackson they 're passable , but nothing more . *skip* on to track 8 - speechless - arguably the strongest moment on the record . one of only two tracks that jackson actually penned himself , and it shows . the amount of emotion in his voice will knock you prone , and actually proves very well what the rest of the album lacks : joy for the music , and personal emotion . the lyrics are like a poem , and one of the most beautiful love declarations in all their simplicity . top grade to jackson for this one track , and if you are into his music , buy the cd cheeply just to get this track . track 9 - 2000 watts - is another of the stronger moments of the record . this one is simply plain fun , and that 's another important lesson jackson should have lurned - to let go of the reigns , and stop caring whether it 's hip or street or down with the trend - because it is n't - but this is darn good pop music , and nigh irresistable . *skip* on to track 13 - cry - penned by r . kelley . the same r . kelley who is guilty of writing one of the most horrible songs of all times ( i believe i can fly , if you had doubts ) , but it seems that with jackson , he can do no wrong . he wrote the endearing you are not alone - major hit in europe - and this track is possibly even better . oh , forget about the sappy lyrics , and just enjoy the wonderfull music . this is pop writing in top class , and if jackson sounds like he takes the marthyr role a bit too seriously , it 's still one of the best tracks on the record . track 14 - the lost children - is the other song penned by michael alone , and it 's not a bad effort - had it not been for the children choir and sleezy intro , you could probably have ignored the lyrics and enjoyed a nice pop tune . as it is , it falls somewhat flat , and becomes completely choking in the end - but yes , it 's a nice tune . thumps up , mr . jackson . track 15 - whatever happens . ok , that 's one weird track . michael jackson featuring santane . wtf ? well , kudos for doing this , and it actually works , in a sort of absurd way . not single potential , and not a classic , but it 's not embarassing , and as an album filler , it 's completely acceptable as a cureosity . well , what about the rest of it then ? lead single you rock my world was never my favorite - the spoken intro is downright embarassing - but the track is not bad . i can accept that on the record . the same is not true for the horrible ballads break of dawn , heaven can wait , butterflies , you are my life and do n't walk away . one is worse than the next , and every time i just try to listen to them , i start chocking to the degree of loosing my last meal . yes , it 's that bad , no really , it 's horrible . i . can't . stand . these . songs . period . there are simply no redeeming qualities for me . and then the two monstrosities - privacy and threatened - that just sound like a very - very - bad joke on the man himself . tabloid junkie from history actually worked , because it packed a great punch , and well , had not been heart before . well it had been , it was pretty much the same as why you wanna trip on me from dangerous , but still . it worked . ghosts was a good track of blood on the dance floor . forget about the movie that was - well , embarassing . but the music was good . these tracks aren't . they sound dated , repetitive , out of place and utterly boring and uninspired . get over it jackson , we do n't want to hear more about the media nagging you , it 's not going to make them go away . well , all in all , what do we have ... to take the album from a to z : unbreakable - 6 / 10 - a fair dance track . heartbreaker - 6 / 10 - same . invincible - 6 / 10 - same . break of dawn - 0 / 10 - horrible r'n'b overproduced . vomit . heaven can wait - 0 / 10 - same . you rock my world - 5 / 10 - well , at least it sounds new . butterflies - 0 / 10 - more vomit . speechless - 10 / 10 - the flower in the dirt . one true mj song . 2000 watts - 8 / 10 - very enjoyable , and stands out tall compared to the rest . you are my life - 0 / 10 - even more vomit . privacy - 2 / 10 - yawn . repetitive and dated . do n't walk away - 0 / 10 - end of vomit . cry - 9 / 10 - beautiful showmanship , kelly + jackson works - again . the lost children - 6 / 10 - well , it has potential . whatever happens - 7 / 10 - interesting , and well , refreshing , if somewhat strange . threatened - 2 / 10 - same as privacy , and exactly as boring . this yields and average about 3.6 / 10 , or 2 / 5 stars , which actually matches my fealings for this album fairly well . yes , i 'm harsh , but from a man as gifted as jackson , you just expect more . quality control next time , please , mr . jackson . on the bottom line : outtakes the way you love me and we 've had enough showed up on the 2004 ultimate collection and outranked 2 / 3 of this album by far . go figure

dvd neg 971.txt what a mind-numbingly inept end chapter to a series that began with the greatest horror-comedy of all time , the re-animator . continuing in his deluded quest to claim the re-animator series for his own , and to convince us that he can direct , producer brian yuzna has managed the opposite . beyond re-animator merely confirms what was evident about the yuzna-directed bride of re-animator , that yuzna knows nothing about directing actors and story . as with dagon , yuzna seems to have secured financing from spanish sources for this film . unfortunately , the problem is that they also tried to force in a mostly spanish cast . this is a story set in massachusetts , for crying out loud - - why would the warden of the prison , the reporter coming to cover the story , the guards , and a good 90 per cent of the inmates all have spanish accents ? it would n't be as howlingly horrible if these guys could act , but they can't . simon andreu as warden brando and elsa pataky as love interest laura olney get the most screentime of anyone in the cast , but their acting is so bad , and their adr-afflicted lines so glaringly off , that they manage to sink the film every time they open their mouths . yuzna seems to pick his leading ladies based on their willingness to take off their clothes ( witness the gratuitous " nurse nipple " scene in this film , or fabiana udenio and kathleen kinmont in bride of re-animator ) , and pataky makes for one of the most unsympathetic love interests i can remember . but even pataky and andreu pale in incompetence next to that blustery , seething mass of bad acting that is leading man jason barry . based on yuzna 's shoddy history with actors , one might be tempted to blame it on the director , but the fact is that in this film , jason barry is incapable of pulling off a single believable moment , basic elementary acting . his every internal and external beat rings false , his dialogue delivery sounds like a cold reading , and even his basic body movements look like amateur theatre . most high-school students do better than this . jeffrey combs as herbert west , seasoned pro that he is , gamely plays along , but the script puts west 's character so far off to the sideline in favour of the vomit-inducing pataky-andreu axis that combs is unable to save this film . on a strictly technical level , the cinematography looks good , the score is all right ( though often too serious-minded for its own good ) , and the film does n't look low-budget . but when the " story " is such a mess and the actors so inept , no amount of slick lighting and camera moves can save a film . yuzna really should stick with producing , because on the stuart gordon-directed dagon , at least there were some good moments . but beyond re-animator is beyond salvaging , possibly the worst film sequel i 've ever seen , and way up there in the list of worst films i 've ever subjected myself to

software neg 140.txt i have to qualify this review by saying that i do not own pm 8.0 , so i cannot fairly give a rating , despite overwhelmingly negative reviews . i can only relate personal experience with norton / symantec products . i do own and have used pm 6.0 since ' 01 when it was still powerquest instead of norton / symantec and it has worked very well , though the gui is a bit quirky . i have run it with 2 drives , one with 98se and xp pro , with pm loaded on 98se partition and it did everything i needed on both drives . trouble is , version 5.0 is , afaik , not compatible with xp and since m$ no longer supports 98se , we have a problem , houston . currently i am using a mobile drive bay to switch drives as needed . if i get a drive partitioning software product compatible with xp , it most assuredly will not be anything produced by norton / symantec , based on these reviews and personal experience with norton / symantec products . i first bought a computer in ' 98 and used norton antivirus 5.0. at that time , norton was probably the best antivirus product out there . it worked flawlessly and i used and recommended it for years . no more . i purchased a copy of symantec system works 2005 right after it was released . long story short , i no longer use norton products because i got tired of the system crashes and stability issues caused by the unstable bloatware and system resource hog that it has become , and am currently using a competing product that is very highly rated but is not common on the shelves of the big box stores . there is one lone symantec product i still use- --windoctor , which is not installed on my ' puter but ran from the cd as needed . adios , anything else produced by norton / symantec . it ai n't worth the headaches when there are much better products available for less coin .

" next let me thank ne-yo for bringing true r&b back to the industry ! i dont consider songs about cheating on your bf / gf / husband / wife r&b . r&b is supposed to be about love - thats why people call them slow love songs . and from 2001 - 2005 new slow love songs did n't exist . i ended up listenin to the same songs from da 90 's over and over until i got so tired of them , and was fortunate to be lucky enough for my radio station ( that plays mostly rap : a genre of music i dont like ) to play " so sick " by ne-yo . it was a great song . this is literally the first and only r&b album that i never have the urge to use the fast forward feature to get to the next song ! ne-yo 's lyrics are strictly romantic and sweet too ! he is a lyrical genius . his voice is soothing and melodic . most r&b albums obviously have rap tracks or rushed r&b songs as filler to probably meet the deadline or get the cd out as fast as possible and reducing the enjoyability of the cd , but this album has all songs that are great . all of the tracks on this album are great , but here are the ones that are superb : 1. so sick - 9 / 10 ( would be a 10 if it was n't played over and over and with so many different versions . although i can still listen to it over and over 2. when you 're mad - 9 / 10 ( for those guys who like the look on girls faces when they get mad . maybe for michelle rodriguez fans . : ) ) 3. get down like that 10 / 10 ( both versions ) ( i call it " dont get down like that " ) ( this song is for the guys that are completely faithful like me ) ( if you 're not a player , and proud of being faithful , this is da song for you ) 4. sexy love - 10 / 10 ( great song . um hmmm. . what can i say about this one about its lyrics ? .... oh yes... . this song is for the guys who have a girl and when she touches them , it just feels like... . magic . ) this is da only cd dat ever deserved 5 stars by me , the only reason i gave other r&b albums 5 stars is cuz i took into consideration : there was no r&b album that existed that had nothing but good tracks , and most had poorly done upbeat song
software pos 897.txt the computer game version of the number devil closely follows the book , as kids progress through sections on prime numbers , the fibonacci series , pascal 's triangle , and an infinite series approaching one . nine of the ten games worked well for us , but nobody in the family was ever able to complete the tenth , the arrow game . we understood the math , but could n't react quickly enough to shoot down all the arrows . this was disappointing , because we could never reach the bonus section . all in all , though , this is a good investment for a child , 8 or up , who loves or wants to understand the mystery of numbers

dvd neg 77.txt who would give the green light to this ? it is a total remake of the 1968 classic . the only difference is that there is a slight revamp to reflect modern times . since it mirrors the original then it deserves what the biggest complaint hsould be of it...it pales in comparison to the original . this was really weird to remake this movie . " dawn of the dead " was cool b / c it had a new , fresh spin to the story . this has no scares , no atmosphere , no innovations and no riveting performances . skip this one
health neg 588.txt i like to use the wet wipes , they 're good products . i gave only 2 stars because the package was n't packed well . i received the package this week . all seals of three boxes were broken , lids fell off , and the wipes were everywhere in the package , they were dried up , but the amazon packing box was all soaked wet , and it almost fell apart . what a mess it was !
software neg 867.txt i bought this software because i really wanted to learn spanish and be fluent . the price and marketing of the company made me believe that this package was the most complete package on the market . so i was very excited to receive it after spending $450 on a software . my excitement did not last long after that . i was shocked to see how the software itself looked , i was expecting a top of the line interface for the price i paid but that software seemed years old . but i still wanted to get my money worth so tried the first level for hours , even days , as i was convinced i could learn spanish with it . i also tried the other 2 levels to make sure that my issue was not only with that first level . i had looked at the demo and noticed that most of the content was based on that same acitivity with the 4 pictures . i was expecting different exercises for the full version...the software gets so repetitive , i was really disappointed , even more because of the outrageous price of that package
camera neg 528.txt i 've just returned this camera for poor facial image quality after using it extensively for months . my regular camera is a fuji finepix s602z which is large and bulky , but , takes superb facial shots . i tried the casio due to needing something small to carry in my purse for special events and i 'm heartbroken at the incredible photo opps i 've had that resulted in poor facial quality . do n't buy this camera if you care about what everyone looks like . i 've just ordered the powershot sd1000 because of the facial detection feature on it . hopefully , it is better since i do n't want to have to carry my bulky fuji to get great facial photos . i 'll review the cannon once i 've had it for a few months

books pos 463.txt i 'll be honest , i do n't like fiction books . but i 've got to tell you , a mulligan for bobby jobe has changed my mind . mr. cullen adds so much detail that the reader comes away with a sense of actually being in touch with the cast of limited characters and the events taking place . the twists and unpredictable turns make the book a truly unforgettable experience . you do n't need to be a golfer or a fan of golf to enjoy this novel . can lightning strike twice ? absolutely

music neg 548.txt this cd was a big seller upon it 's release in 1992 , boasting a plethora of big hits , along with some new songs . looking back through 2005 eyelids , it 's hard to hear why these songs were so huge....the cd starts off well , with hits from the primitive love album , but as one keeps listening , he realizes that none of these songs have passion or depth , a few catchy melodies and pleasant , if plain vocals . the dance numbers at least keep you awake , but the years 1988-92 found estefan leaning on ballads , and one was barely distinguishable from another ; on top of that , the 4 new cuts feel like padding , to fill a cd 's worth of material for a christmastime release...a couple of hits are missing , too ( i.e. , bad boys ) , so to summarize , nothing truly bad here , but precious little on target.. .
software neg 901.txt i was thoroughly disappointed . the first few words i looked up in the thesaurus were not listed - - words like upholstery ! when i went online to see what i might be able to glean from their online site , first fogware had not sent me a coupon , then i had to deal with bad customer service ( i am not doing business with any companies anymore that give bad support ) then after i finally got the coupon code they had left out of my box , the online info is exactly what we have in the cd - - so save your money and do not subscribe to their extended services site unless you need a spanish online dictionary also ! very bad ! i am now going to go buy roget 's and check it out

books neg 422.txt very politically manipulative primer that only gives 5 / 8 of the story . i add 1 / 8 because the author does acknowlege some of the huge problems caused by unbridled global capitalism , but then quickly glosses them over basically saying that these effects are unfortunate , but that free global trade is best for everyone in the long run . there is a lot of interesting incidental information as various terms are explained , but too often this reference becomes a one-sided sermon for free trade . these are the same deceptions that robert reich started pushing under clinton . repubs kept the song going without missing a beat . most of both dem and repub reps support neoliberal policies - the rich get richer in both parties . feel free to read to learn about terms , just be aware that the author is leading you down a highly biased path
dvd neg 498.txt you know the feeling...that feeling of " oh my gosh , how did i ever spend money on this movie and when is it ever going to end ? " well , that 's what unfortunately accompanies this dull and somber film . unfortunately , because of its all-star cast , although this would n't be the first time in movie history where an all-star cast is wasted . aside from an interesting peek into the world of yale 's secret skull and bones society , a delightful cameo by joe pesci and a few too cute-by-half zingers , this movie has little or nothing to offer . it does n't keep one 's attention and by the time you try to care enough about what is going on , you realize that you do n't even care about the characters . matt damon 's skulking and scowling leading role lacks rhythm and chemistry , especially with the beautiful angelina jolie , and he is laughably miscast as a father . in fairness however , with the script he 's been given , it 's hard to see how damon could have done much better . the pacing of the film is extradinarily slow and one can just imagine people walking out of the theater before it ends . a huge disappoinment especially since director deniro is such a talented actor . skip it

music pos 592.txt as much as i hear time and again that " mindcrime " was the seattle quintet 's finest , i always have to argue that this 1986 gem is the pinnacle of their career . while i was a big fan of mindcrime and it 's predecessor " the warning " , rage for order is qr 's most consistent release and is mezmerising from start to finish . in a word. . " perfect " . so few bands can boast having made a perfect album . i can think only of the beatles ( sgt. pepper & revolver to name a few ) , pink floyd ( the wall , dark side ) , dream theater ( images & awake ) , and boston ( debut ) . rage is an album to be listened to and appreciated . released in the hey-day of " hair metal " , this album has not one single song that lends itself to the tag . none of the songs , while very image provoking , could be easily made into an mtv hit . although " gonna get close to you " aired on mtv ( rarely i might add ) it did n't even scratch the surface of this album 's potential . overall , the performances of each member outshine anything before , or since . degarmo and wilton trade licks masterfully . rockenfield and jackson keep a very tight bottom end . tate...well...tate was the metal singer at that time and this was his finest performance . while the mix was somewhat lacking , the production was incredible . each song blends into each other perfectly . this was metal that was unique and completely original . i think the term " thinking man 's metal " was coined at the time . that said , i can think of no other release at the time to which that term could be applied . unlike most of their metal contemporaries at the time , rage was athmospheric , intellectual , and surreal . rage succeeded where priest 's " turbo " failed abysmally . it was a stark vision of the future and the metal was more futuristic than we 'd ever heard before . it was like listening to a whole new machine . it still holds it 's own 20 year later , seeming as fresh and " now " as anything in progressive metal .
music neg 572.txt after two albums of wholly instrumental music , joe satriani apparently decided it was time to start singing . " flying in a blue dream " is the only satriani record with several ( six ) vocal cuts . so how are they ? well , satch 's voice is n't superb , but he does an ok job . the problem really is with the material- - it 's clear he 'd gotten used to writing pieces as guitar features . the only real exception to this in my assessment is frantic electric blues " big bad moon " - - the piece is blazing and explosive , the vocal is passable , and satriani is on fire . but pieces like " ride " , " the phone call " and " strange " are all pretty much forgettable ( well , " ride " is actually a bit too irritating to be forgettable.. . ) . the remainder of the material is a mix between exploratory ( and primarily acoustic ) pieces ( " the feeling " ) which are nice but largley filler and " surfing with the alien " styled instrumentals ( " one big rush " , " back to shalla-bal " ) . the exception is the chugging opener and title track , " flying in a blue dream " , which features satriani at his most lyrical as a guitarist . invariably , the album is a bit too weak for its own good- - it 's probably also a bit too long ( about 65 minutes ) and probably would have benefited from being trimmed down a bit . start with " surfing with the alien " , come back to this if you want more of the same

software neg 542.txt if you are accustomed to using other versions of coreldraw , you may not want this version . fact is , they have made many so-called " improvements " which i find are incompatible with other software that i have used in the past . it does not convert to encapsulated postscript ( eps ) files properly , and will crash programs that traditionally work well with eps figures . by contrast , coreldraw 11 worked well . hence the " improvement " has rendered the software a nuisance . if you are accustomed to pasting figures into other software , forget it . coreldraw x3 will not retain the integrity of the original figure , and it will look distorted and crummy . any prior version of coreldraw worked well . again , the " improvement " has made the software a nuisance . on top of that , it crashes a lot . i contacted their " customer service " about a year ago when i first discovered these differences . i was assured that they knew about the problems and were working on them . well , a year later , with no patches to correct these differences , i am now being told that it is everyone else 's fault ( software manufacturers ) that coreldraw is not compatible . i was also told that they have no intention to correct these problems because they do not consider them problems . there is an example of their customer service for you . i have been using coreldraw for a long time , starting with 6 , then 9 , then 11. this is the worst of the bunch by far . i am going back to a previous version .
books pos 973.txt rawlings explores the lives and interations of the odd assortment of people living in cross creek , florida in the early 1900s . it is often assigned reading for teens , but i doubt that most of them can appreciate it . her accounts of neighbors feuding and subsistance living gives us many lessons in human behavior . the lyrical descriptions of wildlife and the orange groves and wild landscape are very appealing . your mouth waters as you read her essays on downhome foods like hush puppies . she turned those into a cookbook which i 'll have to try out . modern readers squirm uncomfortably at her use of the n- -- - - word and her characterization of blacks as irresponsible , drunken , immoral , etc. it is probably a faithful representation of common thinking at the time it was written , so recognize it as a snapshot of the times . then move past that to luxuriate in the beautiful passages in the book . ( i deducted 1 star for this ) the reader becomes absorbed in rawlings ' love of the land and the creation of a home . it gives much the same feelings as a year in provence or under a tuscan sun

books neg 103.txt i found this book at a thrift store for 25 cents . i flipped though it and it looked dated , but interesting , so i decided to get it . as other reviewers mention , it is dated - - but you gotta know that up front when you get it . it 's published in 1986 , when there were no ( well , almost no ) home computers . so you have to accept up front that it 's talking about organizing papers using more papers - - but that 's something we still all got to do occasionally . so it 's a system of notepads , file folders , etc. it does help you try to understand why you want to keep papers , etc , and what you can do about it . however , it does get overly complex , and really does n't seem applicable in today 's world , where there are far fewer " homemakers " who spend time organizing sewing and recipe files , as this book seems to be focused on . finally , i have to mention that it was the continual religion-related references that put me off to the book in the end . others who are comfortable with this may not even notice it , but for me , i felt i was being preached to a bit too much to find it tolerable . just my personal taste ; i 'm sure some others will disagree with this judgement , but i have to admit after enough casual religion references tossed randomly throughout the text , i gave up on the book and put it in the recycle bin

dvd pos 134.txt spoiler alert the ending of this 118-minute marvel seems an almost foregone conclusion . the bored billionaire did it . however , he and the sexy insurance detective play with each other until the audience is very , very hot . pierce brosnan , the billionaire , still sexist from his stint as james bond , enjoys playing with the lady , renee russo . and she , as the tough but sexy catherine olds banning , loses her heart to him , as much heart as such a sexpot character is allowed . in the process , she shows some very appealing nipples . the 1968 version , of which this is a remake , starred steve mcqueen and faye dunaway . in this version , to the socially irresponsible , self-absorbed 90s are ever present . we do n't mind not having the suspense , we just yearn to see brosnan and russo " get it on . " dunaway appears as a psychiatrist who is trying to help the billionaire figure out why he is so socially irresponsible . brosnan , as thomas crown , is bored , but open to being titillated by a beautiful woman , for as long as he is interested in her . for thrills , he steals priceless works of art from publicly-funded museums . the film makes it clear he can do so , under the noses of security guards , police , and hundreds of innocent art-lovers . russo 's insurance company insured the painting , so she is looking to recover the irreplaceable , but impossible to fence monet , and save her employer a bundle . what we have here is a film with clever dialog , rich and exotic sets , and loads of sexual tension . one wonders now , after enron , worldcom , tyco , and other corporate heists , just whom brosnan is cheating in order to support his high-tech heist brigade . how many of his employees are going to lose their pensions or health care benefits over this . he never really , you know , works . but i digress . dennis leary has a character role as the streetwise new york detective , who advises russo 's banning . as we watch her slowly spiral out of control , risking her job and her reputation , we are kept mildly engaged in the question of whether russo will fall for him , or brosnan . duh . the film moves back and forth from caper to cover-up . this can be confusing , but who cares ? all we have to do is wait for their next move , the next gorgeous set , the next revealing love scene . the thomas crown affair will keep both men and women interested , for all the usual reasons . it is a film worth watching , and a great date flick

music neg 419.txt history has a way of making the radical seem conservative , and certainly within the context of cecil taylor 's music , his debut album , " jazz advance " is rather conservative . taylor , known for his relentless , dense music , did not emerge fully formed ( although even at this early date , his music is far removed from his hard bop contemporaries ) , but developed over time . for those of us who enjoy taylor 's music , this record is a historical curiosity , for anyone else , its either going to sound as one permutation further from the early ornette coleman idiom ( indeed , this music is far closer to coleman 's sound than anything taylor would be doing in the ' 60s or later ) . my understanding is that when this was first released , it raised quite a stir . its a bit difficult to see why . taylor is largely melodic- - performing pieces with coherent themes- - his experimentations seem to be in the use of block chords , odd inversions , and in soloing underneath the primary voice at this point . the record is four originals and four standards , and as one would suspect , taylor largely breathes on his own compositions . he is backed by nearly inaudible bassist buell neidlinger and drummer dennis charles , with soprano sax player steve lacy on two tracks . neidlinger and charles are far closer in the hard bop idiom- - their performances swing , charles in particular is playing way inside hard bop . this puts them a bit at odds with taylor , who , while he gives more space than he would on his later work , is still more of a neoclassical improvising pianist than a jazz pianist . when lacy plays , taylor 's form of comping does n't seem fully formed , or lacy does n't seem quite prepared to play inside taylor 's environment , and as a result he sounds somewhat detached from the pianist . the sounds of the future can clearly be heard on several tracks , " bemsha swing " features many of taylor 's clustered chords and runs , solo piano take on " you 'd be so nice to come home to " presents the theme in a barely recognizable fashion and is as close to his future organized chaos as he 'd get , and while original " rick kick shaw " is far away from where he 'd end up , its the first sign of the short of aggression that taylor would harness in the future . the music is enjoyable enough , but taylor would reach such heights that its hard to not listen to this without comparing it to his future works . the other complaint is the sound- - this issue is from 1991 and is in desparate need of remastering . in the end , this is an album of historical value . if you 're looking for an introduction to taylor 's music and are n't ready to dive head first into his methods , try " looking ahead ! " , its a far superior album by which point neidlinger and charles ( who reprise their roles ) were far more closely integrated with taylor 's music
music pos 54.txt ...because it felt like it predicted that i 'd be listening to the cd someday . i 'm referring to the line " the kids of ad 2000 will draw from the music much the same sense of well being and warmth that we do today . " now i admit that i was 18 in 2000 so i guess i technically missed the literal kid description by a year , but the more general prediction of the inter-generational , timeless appeal of the beatles was right on . i did n't see them on the ed sullivan show . i was born almost twelve years after they broke up , and about a year after the tragic shooting of john lennon . but i , like many , many other people born too late to have experienced beatlemania as it was occuring , have since become a huge fan of all their work . this album has my favorite of all the beatle 's songs : i 'll follow the sun . that song alone is worth the five stars , but thankfully the rest of the album is great too . this album gets a little bit too much grief , and it may not be quite as amazing as something like abbey road , but it 's still better than just about anything else out there .

dvd neg 316.txt i watched this with some trepidation , and i have to say it was both better and worse than i thought it would be . it was better because it remained fairly true to the original , in terms of retaining the multiple conflicting story lines and the ambiguous ending . it was worse because the attempts at erotica were less entertaining than the original , and i found stone 's lampshade hairstyle oddly distracting . a couple of things kept me viewing this dvd . one was the london setting , which gave me an opportunity to see what time has done to one of my old home towns . the other was sharon stone 's rather plucky performance , and the presence of charlotte rampling , who has aged into a different kind of beauty . morrisey does n't even come close to filling michael douglas 's shoes , and it 's hard to feel sorry for him at the end . as with the first movie , you are left with the feeling that there was a better film waiting to be made . the basic idea of a psychotic novelist who feels compelled to act out her fantasies in real life is an intriguing one . however , both movies were quick to abandon hitchcockian understatement for speeding cars and gratuitous sex . there 's nothing wrong with either of these things , but here they just get in the way
camera pos 531.txt i bought this together with the sony alpha ( very good deal from amazon ) . the lens is a great complement to the kit lens or the identical but older km 18-70. images are very sharp and the lens is built very well . great for wildlife imaging . the other reviewers are right ; the af is n't too good at the long end of this lens but overall a great camera . the end of the lens does rotate while zooming . it may not be good for some filters
camera pos 28.txt i am very happy with this set of filters . the price was right and they come with a carry case so you dont have to worry how you are going to carry them if you go lite , camera and filters
camera neg 164.txt i love canon products and i have had a complete canon system for about 10 years . i love everything canon does . however i do not understand canon 's reasoning behind producing this lens . the reason for the ef-s lenses is offering wider angle by getting the rear elements of a lens closer to the " film " plane . they cannot do this on film and full frame sensor cameras because the mirror is larger and would hit the rear elements of an ef-s lens . they have indicated , however , that by 35 mm that advantage is gone . why then do they produce a 60 mm macro lens when they already have their macro requirements covered with they current three lenses ? i would guess that the short back focus makes the lens cheaper ; but this lens is only $60 short of the excellent 100 f2.8 usm macro . as i said , if for $60 i can get a lens that has 40 mm more reach ( 66 in 1.6crop cameras ; useful in macro photography ) and that works on all canon cameras , i 'm not going to be thinking about this lens at all . granted , you might not be thinking of buying a ff camera anytime soon , but canon has indicated that eventually they will have ff on all their dslr 's , so why bother with this lens ? the 17-85 or 10-22 are very reasonable offerings for the ef-s lineup , but the 60mm macro does n't make any sense to me . my $0.0
books neg 519.txt ms milton admits to her anger at humanistic psychology , so she attacks without understanding . she does not seem to grasp even some of the basic concepts of the people 's work she denigrates . maslow 's hierarchy of needs is one example . i have spent a great deal pf time studding humanistic psychology and writings . i have had the pleasure of being trained in group therapy with carl rogers , and william coulson as instructors . any one who really studies these writers will see how bad a job ms milton did presenting them . she should have let her anger subside before she wrote the book . her bias is extreme and obvious . so consider this when reading the book . no doubt ms milton will have a new career appearing on the conservative religious programs . i am sure pat robinson and jerry falwell have or will book her to speak out against the evils of humanistic psychology
books neg 8.txt i have been a fan of sue henry since her first jessie arnold mystery . i was looking forward to reading her lastest adventure , but was very disappointed in this outing . the characters were one-dimensional . after discovering who the " bad guys " were i needed to reread part of the book for clarification . sue henry has a very annoying habit of foreshadowing at the end of many of her chapters . " ...they had n't a notion just how decidedly things could - and would - change in the next few hours . " even the relationship between alex and jessie seemed stilted . i realize it is difficult to create plausible mysteries for a civilian like musher jessie arnold , but this book tried too hard and accomplished too little

software pos 413.txt i do n't write reviews often but this product is so great i had to share my thoughts on it . i bought this product because i was going back to graduate school ( mechanical engineering so please excuse my grammar ) and i wanted an extra boost in brain power . i have been using this product just about everyday for weeks now and the results are very apparent . i have noticed two obvious improvements in myself . first , i can now navigate a city with ease . i always knew my short term memory was the limiting factor in my navigation abilities . before i 'd always forget where i came from , left or right , what street im on , etc. i always had people correct me . now i am the one leading and its not because i am paying more attention . without directly thinking of my orientation i just know where to orient myself ( my gf would always correct me , but now im correcting her ) . the second obvious improvement is my improved speech and listening abilities . i 'd always have trouble fumbling in my speech and understanding people . but now i feel i can think of what to say more quickly and clearly . i have been doing many puzzles this past summer and the combination of that and brain builder really changed my life . i think more clearly and i can think " better " now . hard to explain but the " fog has been lifted " . everything is easier now whether its putting something together or understanding the environment around me . also my iq scores appear to shoot up really high but thats up to debate . i just want to say what a great product this is and i highly recommend it to anyone . im sure when i start school this fall i 'll see a leap in my abilities . jaso
software neg 518.txt i have been a fan of spyware doctore for some time . spyware doctor 4.0 was an excellent product . it did it job pretty good without taking up any significant resource . but unfortunately it seems that pctools have not yet got their act together for version 5.0. the first version i received as an upgrade was version 5.0 build 172. problems started as soon as my machine rebooted . the spyware doctor service for apparently no reasons hogged the system resource to an extent 95-97%. killing that does not matter because the application restarts after 15 sec , and also that it seems to be the heart of the application . after reboot the update started running and bam came the blue screen of death . so after a series of reboots and crashes i installed the version 5 build 176. but that too did not work , hence finally i reverted back to version 4.0 and eveythig works perfectly.please stay away from version 5.0 till pctools get their act together . as a reference do go through the review of cnet for this product [...]
books pos 864.txt this book opens our eyes . sure , we feel that we know what we should be doing . many times we are right in our hunches . yet , we still do not always do what needs to be done . instead , out of either laziness or taking the easy road , we fail because it is so easy to do so . besides , the customer will always walk in the door . right ? as this book reminds us , the customer may never be back . it is in the insight of a professioanl like tasca that we are reminded of wehat we may already know . again , our implementation of these rules which he explains simply , we will achieve . another book i encourage is " cars and people : how to put the two together .

books pos 92.txt this book consists of 29 stand-alone essays , beautifully written and previously published in the " new england journal of medicine " during the early seventies . from the first chapter : " the viruses , instead of being single-minded agents of disease and death , now begin to look more like mobile genes...we live in a dancing matrix of viruses ; they dart , rather like bees , from organism to organism , from plant to insect to mammal to me and back again , and into the sea , tugging along pieces of this genome , strings of genes from that , transplanting grafts of dna , passing around heredity as though at a great party . " although there is no continuity from chapter to chapter , there are consistent threads of thought as the author free associates : 1.there is a joyful attitude about science and discovery and abundant tidbits about the goings on of living things . 2.there is constant reference to the interaction , symbiosis , and co-operative living arrangements amongst the different species . 3.there are numerous references to the mindless activities of ants , bees , and termites , whose activities create sophisticated , developed projects without any evidence of central control . these examples are repeatedly compared to humans and their social activities , with the human emphasis being on language . 4.the cell is the unit of life , complete with all its intricate inner workings . the cell membrane ( cell wall in plants ) is the protective layer that makes this unit of life possible . in the first chapter and frequently throughout , the author wants to think of the earth as a kind of organism , but he ca n't make it work - too big , too complex , too many working parts without visible connections . then in the last chapter , a better analogy emerges . the earth is like a huge cell and the protective atmosphere that shields us from meteors and cosmic rays is our cell membrane . this fine book is a precursor to books from the likes of carl sagan , richard feynman , and stephen jay gould . reading the chapters randomly is not a bad idea - each one is only four to six pages long and each gives the reader plenty to think about . amazingly , after 30 years , there is a little - but not much - in this book that is out of date . if you are a little rusty on biology , have your " oxford dictionary of science " handy . first class .

software pos 326.txt this is the 3 copy version of norton av . ( one cd will create three copies ) i purchased it to save money as it was less than $20 per copy . i bought it to replace nav 2006 on the same three computers which had expired . installed easily on two machines . just the uninstall of 2006 and the install of 2007. the first machine was more difficult . there is evidently some conflicting software on the computer as i had to use msconfig for a " clean boot " per norton web site instructions . i kept running into the " blue screen of death " on the previous installs when i would get to the actual install of the norton av . each time i would have to uninstall the program and do more . but all of the help came from the symantec ( norton ) website . it is now working fine . added : my personal preference is to not use software firewalls . i use a router with nat as a hardware firewall . ( it only blocks unauthorized incoming malware ) software firewalls try to tell you about everything leaving your computer and generally you either become paranoid or just shut the thing off . they are intended to look for malware by behavior . antivirus programs look for malware by signature . the only advantage to finding malware by behavior is if the computer is attacked in the first day or two of the malware 's existence . if one has an antivirus program it will eventually ( within a few days ) find the problem that the software firewall was trying to tell someone about . ( assuming they have n't given up yet with too many cries for wolf ) . so the only software firewall i have ( microsoft os firewall ) is turned off and thus i have n't had the same problem as others report . as a practice i sent junk email directly to the trash can and avoid weird websites . so far no problems with malware .

dvd neg 209.txt this movie had many of the ingredients to make it truly great , including a phenomenal cast , lead by cate blanchett , and great scenery and cinematography . the actors playing elizabeth , cecil , and walsingham spoke and acted admirably , each phrase spoken with such honesty and feeling , but the words themselves rendered the performances useless . the director and the author of the script greatly misunderstood the characters and the material . they should have read elizabeth the first 's biography by elizabeth jenkins . it is useless to say a movie does not need to be historically accurate but has only to entertain : had the author and director been more historically accurate , they would not have created the unbelievable character they created in elizabeth , who is in turn hysterical , defeatist , overbearing , childish , tyrannical , who never shows her core intelligence , her great love of her people , who had a private core described by her motto " semper eadem " , be always one . elizabeth ruled with her advisors , she was not totally ruled by them . she would not have put up with norfolk screaming at her across the council table , nor would burleigh have allowed it . cate blanchett 's wonderful acting and presence were pearls thrown before swine , wasted on a character portrayal that totally lacked any integrity , much less truth . how could the director think that the woman he was trying to portray was any kind of real woman ? the ending had me blushing with embarassment for one and all . we are laughably given william cecil as wimpy and ineffective , and walsingham as the mastermind behind the throne . one of the reviews said that the director inspired rush to play walsingham much like the hindu god krishna . i suggest that he should have first read some english history

camera neg 432.txt i 'm sure that if the camera worked properly , it would have been fantastic ; however , i received a camera on my birthday this year , only to have difficulty with the focussing mechanism . i took 4 blurry shots of my son 's birthday party , and the next time i turned the camera on , the lcd screen was broken . we purchased the extended warranty from best buy , so when i brought the camera ( 10 days old , mind you ) in for repair , they insisted that i 'd dropped it and broken it ( which i had n't ) , even though there were no signs of external damage...no scratches , dents or anything . after sending it in , best buy informed me that it would cost us $180 to fix , and that they would n't fix the focussing mechanism until i 'd paid for the lcd screen to be fixed . disgusted , i retrieved my camera from customer service unfixed . i contacted sony , who appologized and told me to send in my camera for free repair . i ended up receiving a call from their repair center , informing me that it would cost me $180 to repair and that lcd screens are not covered , whether i received it broken or not . i tried a third time for repair , only to be told that i would have to pay . my mother tried to use her buyer 's protection plan from her visa ( it was a birthday gift from her to me ) , only to have her money refunded , then re-charged months later when best buy 's legal department would n't pay her visa bill . based upon our experiences ( among other bad experiences with best buy ) , we stopped shopping at best buy , and now own a lovely olympus camera . do n't buy the sony cybershot dsc-t9

books neg 573.txt true , there are many controversies raging about copying dvds and copyrights . i suspect we are in a transition zone with all this and " the industry " will figure out how to help people love and cherish their dvds rather than simply calling everyone a pirate . having said that , i can also understand why an author of such a book would n't want to " say too much " about this controversy , especially if he his looking over his shoulder at " the lawyers . " i was trying to think of an analogy to express my disapointment in this book ( and this is n't a good one ) but it goes like this : you want to go to israel and you buy a book on " israel for dummies " and you search for something , anything on the controversy of the wall they are building . but instead of finding a discussion of the controversy you find a few off-handed quips about " there 's a wall going up and it 's causing some controversy . ' nuff said . " " ' nuff said " ? hel-lo ? were dummies out here , that 's why we bought the dumb book ! there might be some useful information for some people , but i was sorely disappointed
books pos 961.txt there are two different types of larkin poem . the first type , mostly written before 1955 , are influenced by yeats and auden and are mediocre . the second , written when he found his voice , are amongst the most wonderful works of english literature ever written . so what was his voice ? basically that of twentieth century man - atheistic , obsessed with sex , regretting the loss of faith and the old certainties . he takes these subjects and turns them into glorious poems . but here 's the really incredible thing : he uses ordinary , uncomplicated language . no tricks , no arcane allusions , just plain english . it ca n't be denied that the voice is bleak , and it is too uncompromising for some . however , those who like looking into the heart of darkness will find poems which they will remember for the rest of their lives .
books pos 213.txt i agree with the other reviewers . this book is outstanding . if you enjoyed such books as " the davinci code , " " angels and demons , " etc. , you will enjoy this one . bravo to tess gerritsen . i am never disappointed with any of her works

music pos 821.txt i discovered seal the same way that most people did : through his utterly beautiful song " kiss from a rose " . i heard it on the radio one day , and played it constantly for months after that until i finally decided to purchase the album the song was from . as it happens , the song is from seal 's most revered album , his multi-platinum 1994 self-titled album . ( this is not to be confused with his other self-titled album , his debut , released in 1991. ) i did n't know what to expect when i bought the album , having heard only one song from it , but months after purchasing it i 'm glad i made the gamble . i think that the sub-genre which best classifies seal is urban . urban music , according to all music guide , is smooth and polished , often romantic , sometimes uptempo and funky , and features soulful vocals . seal has all of this and more . it has techno beats , but they 're not as overwhelming as one might expect . they blend together with peaceful , occasionally ethereal guitars and seal 's incredibly soothing singing . this is , no doubt , stylish music , but first and foremost it 's a collection of warm , encouraging songs penned by a very talented musician . there 's nothing that comes close to being a bad song here ; there 's not even a slightly weak composition . thus it 's a little harder to pick highlights than usual . some highlights include the strong opening track , " bring it on " ; the emotional hit " prayer for the dying " ; the shimmering " dreaming in metaphors " ; the upbeat " newborn friend " ; and , needless to say , the absolutely wonderful " kiss from a rose " . the closing track , " bring it on ( reprise ) " is another beautiful song , but " kiss from a rose " is possibly the most lovely song i 've ever heard . listening to it in the warmth of one 's home during a snowy december afternoon is an incredibly powerful experience . the message of the album , if there is one , is " keep on going - life is beautiful ! " it could fail under any other popular artist , but seal succeeds marvelously . this is some of the most heartfelt , inspirational singing i 've ever heard . there 's a delightful optimism in seal 's singing that sounds strong rather than naiive . it 's hard to feel down after listening to such an uplifting album as this . seal is certainly one of the most talented musicians of r&b ( or rock - you decide ) . these songs have clear , strong messages , warm , inspirational lyrics , heartfelt , soothing singing , danceable beats , and a whole lot of emotion . once you 've heard " kiss from a rose " , i guarantee you 'll want to pick up the album . if you 're already thinking of doing so , then i encourage you to go forward and buy it ; you wo n't regret it . it 's become one of my favorite albums . when you 're feeling disillusioned or depressed with the state of your life or just life in general , look no further than seal to make you cherish it once again .

dvd pos 880.txt " the talons of weng chiang " is a wonderfully creepy pseudo-historical tale full of mood , atmosphere , and an unusual amount of violence for " doctor who " - -almost as if departing producer philip hinchcliffe was taking a parting shot at his critics on his way out . but it 's not all gloom and doom . this storyline is a fine mix indeed of good old " doctor who " humor at its funniest as well as thrilling " doctor who " adventure at its most gruesome . the dank and dour city streets and slums of late-19th century london make a grim backdrop for a tale of manipulation , madness , and serial murder ( technologically refined cannibalism , really ) , and yet the doctor 's many clever quips and leela 's naively astute observations on " civilized " victorian life keeps the viewer laughing throughout , and the main villain 's second-hand man , li-hsen chang , has some incredibly witty one-liners as well . li-hsen chang himself is a fascinating character , delightfully entertaining on stage and yet cold and ruthless in his service to " weng-chiang , " a stranded , time-traveling dictator from the future who has deceived chang into believing he 's a deity from the taoist pantheon . chang 's paranormal powers , foremost of which is hypnotism , definitely evoke the late victorian fascination with mesmerism ( see the poster advertising his show ) and serve to mark him as a clever echo of the evil fu manchu characters so much the stock villains of pulp fiction , and yet he 's also a tragic figure in many ways- -a healthy , innocent rural farmer whose simple religious beliefs were abused by an evil man- -uprooted and given extraordinary powers along with refinement and authority by his " god " and yet irrevocably corrupted in the process . in many ways this works as a dark counterpoint to the pygmalion-style educational program the doctor 's putting leela through , to her annoyance . if li-hsen chang is an interesting and complex adversary though , the same ca n't really be said for his master , weng-chiang himself . he 's a rather unremarkable two-dimensional villain , i 'm afraid , complete with hokey bad-guy laugh and over-the-top acting . perhaps the writers were going for a sort of campy effect , but if so , they overdid it just a bit . at times too he 's just more annoying than frightening- -every time the ever loyal li-hsen is faithfully going about their nefarious business only to be thwarted by the doctor , weng-chiang throws a fit , savagely berating the poor guy on and on ad nauseum . on this score , weng-chiang is less evil incarnate than a bad reminder of some dysfunctional manager at one 's workplace . it does n't help either that he bears no resemblance whatsoever to the clean-cut bureaucratic deity of education whom he 's presumably impersonating , so that the whole idea comes across as altogether somewhat unconvincing . all in all , though , this is an enjoyable adventure . the doctor is at his sleuthing best , leela shines as a displaced neolithic warrior , and a fine complement of vividly memorable supporting characters keep the story moving right along in an entertaining fashion , all of them brought to life by a fine script and even finer acting . and anyway , li-hsen more than makes up for weng-chiang 's deficiencies as an interesting villain for most of the show , while the cyborg assassin mr. sin is genuinely creepy ( especially if you have a phobia of ventriloquist dolls ) . so this is a fine storyline altogether as long as you take some of it with a grain of salt- -or a dash of soy sauce , rather

camera neg 757.txt there is a serious design flaw with this camera and it is even acknowledged on the faq section of the sony website . " if there are dust particles floating in the air , they can be illuminated by the strong light of the flash and sometimes appear in a recorded image as white , round glare spots . this symptom tends to occur in low-light environments when using a compact digital camera due to the close proximity of the flash to the lens assembly . however , this is not a malfunction . " read : your low-light pictures will have spots all over them ! sony does not think this is a problem . it is a design flaw . if you are only going to use this camera in full sun , then it is fantastic but seriously , there are many other cameras out there that do a much better job !
camera neg 548.txt i purchased this for my wife for valentine 's day . the installation went fine but i have two problems with the device . first , the software to do the picture transfers is awful . you can only select pictures on your computer to download - you ca n't see what photos are on the device in the software . in order to delete photos you have to do it manually from the device itself . i checked the webpage for updated software - no joy . the crop feature is nice ( and well used ) but otherwise i feel like i am looking at a windows 3.1 application . second , the image quality on the device is very poor . i did n't have very high expectations , but this was lower than i expected . reminds me of the picture / screen quality in the very first color cell phone screens , maybe a bit worse . you can make out the picture , but not much detail at all . the advice of cropping the photos to only show headshots is an excellent idea , it 's the only way to get a decent picture . overall , i 'm a little disapointed . but then , you get what you pay for. .

books neg 505.txt while this book is a good reminder to high school students and their parents of the kinds of illiberal attitudes extant on many college campuses , i cannot recommend it to other readers . the author unfortunately perpetuates the right-wing-republican-only stereotype believed by many outside evangelical christianity . she battles as much for her political leanings away from gun control and in favor of all bush administration policies as she does for the truth claims of the gospel . indeed , in reading some of the chapters , it is difficult to see that she has any concept of a christian worldview that might veer in any part from republican platform positions . this is really too bad , because she makes many good points and appears to be courageous in her positions . i would not have begrudged her political point of view at all , had she made a clearer distinction between that and her theological position

books pos 578.txt arrogance by bernard goldberg is a truly enjoyable read . goldberg does n't waste time trying to create a vast left wing conspiracy tied to islam or communism , he just presents the facts as he sees them . as a former insider , he 's got the dirt on media bigwigs , and he 's not afraid to dish . the liberal bias in the news is causing many people to flee the big three networks and turn on cable to find an escape . goldberg offers up several examples of this bias and then goes further by coming up with several suggestions ( some tongue in cheek ) for correcting this slant . he also includes surprisingly frank interviews with tim russert and bob costas . goldberg 's other books bias and 100 people who are screwing up america are also excellent reads . he does n't attack people on a personal level ( although you can tell he has a bit of a grudge against dan rather ) or use hyperbole or vitriol to get his point across . some books written with a conservative slant make you want to throw up your hands and give up on this country , but goldberg 's books do n't have that effect . you can tell he not only loves the country he lives in , but also the profession that he 's chosen , and he has hope for the future .

books neg 723.txt grudem seems to have a very distorted and confused vision of christ . we can only hope that evangelical become more like christ . jesus was the first real liberal and the most radical of liberals . if jesus of nazareth was anything , he was an extraordinary friend of the down - trodden , definitely a liberal , whose advocacy on their behalf so infuriated the ultra-conservative religious and political leaders of his day that they had him killed to prevent the public from hearing the very liberal teaching that you will see quoted abundantly in jesus ' own words on this web site ! those who actually know what the bible says about the life and teaching of jesus recognize that far from being like jesus of nazareth , today 's " religious right " are much more like the kind of clerics who battled this revolutionary prophet from the day he opened his mouth until the day they had him nailed to a cross . although these people claim to represent jesus christ , they rarely quote his teaching or follow his example . what they do instead is use his name ( " in vain " ) to promote their ideas , ideas which jesus himself did not teach , and might well have opposed .

dvd pos 163.txt awhile ago i was having a conversation with someone about musical tastes where we vastly disagreed on what was simply awesome bands and which ones were purely based around taste , such as people who love r&b and rap to people who prefer dance . in a way , texas chainsaw massacre , as well as the exorcist and the shining are like the beatles and led zeppelin of horror movies : you must love them and say anything different and you 're going to get lynched . so i will agree that the film is definately refreshing considering the latest crop of so-called " horror movies " , yet at the same time i wonder why it did n't hit me that much . 5 kids are travelling through the country and hear of a couple of houses . they decide to check it out only no one 's home...seemingly at first . pretty soon they meet leatherface , a man in a burlap sac mask who wields a big fat chainsaw . pretty soon , the kids start going one by one and we find a family seriously depraved and having to escape alive . it 's odd how i ca n't say any more about the plot ; not because of spoilers but because there 's not a lot else to say . like many a filmgoer , i ca n't stand the latest releases in horror . instead of using atmosphere , pacing and mood to creep people out , they go for broke and show some of the more violent scenes . this film is n't even gory at all . in fact , the film 's goriest scene , where one of the kids meets a chainsaw , is n't even shown onscreen . your mind fills in what went on which can probably be even more disturbing . adding to the realism is that it 's shot in a kind of documentary-like style . one problem i had with the film was that the dread did n't feel there . there was pre-mtv style editing and extreme-closeups of eyeballs and maybe i 've just seen it before but it did n't creep me out like it should 've ( and having a woman scream for 20 minutes does n't help ) . if i saw this in 1974 , i mostly likely would 've been creeped out of my wits but seeing it 32 years later , it 's more like " yeah it was alright although i better not say so cause then everybody will bug me about it " . if you 're a fan , go ahead and buy it because it 's probably the best release of the film but personally , i 'm not

camera neg 520.txt i bought my canon a95 in november 2004. a little after 1 year just after the manufacturer 's warranty expired , the infamous e18 error struck . i called the factory repair center to get a repair estimate , and they quoted $89 plus $8 shipping & handling . i bought the camera for $300 online , now it 's going to cost me roughly 1 / 3 of its purchase cost to repair it . for all i know , it might break down again after the repair ! the repair comes with 90-day warranty period , but it could break again after 90 days . and then.. . there is an upgrade option . canon offers a program where you can upgrade a95 for a610 for $125 plus $10 shipping and handling . this comes with only 6-month warranty . again , it could be flawed with the same e18 error that could struck after warranty expires . i would really do extensive research before buying another canon .
books pos 221.txt rewind to 1992. it 's the dawn of the so-called information & knowledge age . back then , i wrote a book on the need to liberate and effectively channel the creativity of all employees in an organization . the rationale : to create higher performing organizations in a time of intense global competition . with pressing needs for superior innovation . and improved productivity . amid ever-leaner budgets . ( sound familiar ? ) flash forward a dozen years to today and ideas are free ( a title echoing phil crosby 's classic quality is free ) . this new book makes clear today that my impassioned plea from a decade ago failed to eradicate idea-stifling organizational cultures . way too many work places , it seems , still quell expressions of innovative thinking by both frontline employees and middle managers . so the case for turning on the innovation spigot needs to be made again with renewed vigor . in answering that call , professors robinson & schroeder offer some worthwhile and occasionally surprising and compelling contributions to this topic that is as relevant now as ever . ideas are free presents an articulate case that organizations - - and individual managers - - need to unleash the *still* largely untapped brainpower intentionally and quite unfortunately held-back by employees . three elements make ideas are free especially worthy of your time and money . 1. the authors aim their advice at regular workaday managers . sure , they rightfully point out how organizational systems are often " dysfunctional . " and they make the case that many corporate practices actually *discourage* creative contributions by individuals even as they try to *incent* those very behaviors . but robinson & schroeder do n't aim their prescriptions at policy-making top executives only . many chapters conclude with what the authors term " guerilla tactics " - - clear directives for simple actions that even frontline supervisors can put to work " without the boss 's permission . " 2. the book dramatically makes the case that paying for ideas - - as part of an organization 's formal suggestion systems - - is fraught with potential negative side-effects . my own corporate experience as an executive championing a newly installed suggestion system bears out the startling reality that this well-intentioned process can turn into a self-destructive minefield . ( and , let the record show , i largely missed this dimension in covering suggestion systems back in my ' 92 work . ) 3. many interesting , well-developed ( albeit occasionally dated ) anecdotes illustrate the book 's sound principles . they help make ideas are free a grounded , engaging , and palatable read . back in ' 92 , i suggested in my book mavericks ! that , " managers should be asking questions like : what is the value of a useful new idea ? if one good idea leads to another , where could thousands and thousands lead us ? what is the cost to the organization for not tapping the endlessly renewable resource of ideas in our employees ' heads ? " getting to the root of the problem , i asked : " is n't the job of a manager to *recognize and choose* from lots of great ideas generated by fellow work associates ? " and answered : " unfortunately , most managers - - even those who claim they invite suggestions from their people - - subscribe to the time-honored myth that a manager 's job is to *have* the ideas . " in 2004 , robinson & schroeder again plow many of these very same themes ( and cite data that also have been around for a long time ) . still , this book explores afresh the opportunities that arise from drawing out the best thinking of every employee . and it presents realistic tactics that all managers can deploy to effectively deal with these still-critical issues . wherever you sit in the hierarchy , read ideas are free to seize powerful ideas about potential gains for your organization 's progress and prosperity . don blohowiak lead well institut

music pos 483.txt no doubt about it , from start to finish , this is a classic for anybody 's collection . i can remember back in the spring of ' 93 when the movie came out and it was a classic as well but the soundtrack matches up to what the movie was and this soundtrack sent a big message to a lot of us about what goes on the inner cities today . this was rap music at it 's best from spice 1 to dj quik . there will not be a soundtrack like this ever again that addresses what goes on in our neighborhoods . so add this to your collection if you still love the true gangster rap , west coast fan ( like myself ) , or just want to hear a great soundtrack

music pos 231.txt honestly , led zeppelin is the only artist that can create monumental album after monumental album and have not one bad song . when you listen to one of their albums in your car , there 's no , " oh , i really like track 2 , but i do n't like the next couple , so i 'll skip to track 5 after that one 's over . " now it is common opinion that the classic albums of led zeppelin are the first five , and " houses of the holy " is the fifth one . this is zeppelin at their pinnacle , which in my opinion , they never fall from . " the song remains the same " is pagey at his best with his gibson double-neck . the song itself makes you want to ride the wind because it is so airy , but at the same time a fast-paced rock tune . page 's initial ( and incredible ) guitar solo makes this song the perfect initial song on this album . " the rain song " is a lovelorn masterpiece with the lovely sounds of an orchestra to help create this mood . the lyrics are deep , and while the song to me is melancholy , it is also refreshing . " over the hills and far away " is a 5-trillion star song , with amazing acoustic and electric guitars with mystic lyrics . " the crunge " is groovy and funny . the bass is really felt in this song , and odd spoken lyrics at the end give a laugh . " dancing days " is very far out , but a summer-y song with an addictive riff . " d'yer mak'er " is one to definitely highlight bonzo 's masterful rhythm skills , or in other words , great drums ! equal to that is pagey on guitar and robert 's singing , " i still love you so...but i ca n't let you go.. . " " no quarter " is the quiet masterpiece that is credited to john paul for an exquisite keyboard solo . " the ocean " is quite the upbeat song on this album with a raunchy riff . an overall energizing song . this is the best deal for this album- -do not pass it up ! i hope this will be a permanent fixture to your collection...not one bad song

camera pos 235.txt i am 67 years old and started out in photography as a kid with a contact printer and a box camera . i have had all types of cameras over the years , mostly 35mm film canon slr's . i too bought all sorts of these 5-7 mp point and shoot digital cameras before returning to my true love , slr's . i have had my digital canon rebel xt about a month now and i ca n't keep my hands off of it . it lacks nothing . although the kit lense is good , i bought a 28-135 canon zoom lense with image stabilizion and have produced stunning photo 's with it . i love the way you can use the 7 points to focus , i mainly use only the center point with focus lock and never get an out of focus picture . i guess the nicest thing for me is that i now do n't have the urge to buy every point and shoot camera that is paraded out on qvc or hsn that has a " wonderful " new feature like " low light or non-shake . " this canon has every good feature in the known universe and you ca n't outgrow it . its a camera that will let you be as good as you can be , it wo n't hold you back . the battery life is great , the built in flash is good but i bought a 430ex and that 's even better . i never figure i 'm wasting money buying accessories for this camera as it will be my main squeeze for many years to come . i always missed my 35mm canon slr 's and now feel that i have an old friend back again , only much much better . believe me , you ca n't go wrong getting this camera , its beyond description.. .
books neg 117.txt the author shows she is obviously making a transition from poetry to prose with this novel . her sentences are long and wordy , and her numerous metaphors make little sense in their context . she goes to great lengths to describe many little and unimportant details , causing the actual story to suffer from lack of content . her descriptions of life in general seem unreal - she describes things and events in a way that no person would do in the circumstance . the storyline is decent in some places , but it is generally hard for the reader to follow . many times , i had to go back to read paragraphs and pages again to realize where the author was going . it is true there were many points in which i wanted to stop reading all together , which is a rarity . i was altogether disappointed in the book . i thought it would be decent , from all the literary awards it had won , but it really was just pages of fluff and poetry disguised as prose

dvd pos 909.txt i think that anyone who believes this movie to be " hilarious " or hudson 's performance " overrated " and " over-the-top " in her singing just does n't like musicals . or perhaps does n't like an all black cast ( i am not black ) or is too young to understand the 60 's world of music and payola and backstabbing . while touted to be similar to the experiences suffered by the supremes with diana ross as its lead singer , it is close in some aspects and totally far away in others . the key words here are " loosely based " on the story of the supremes . why people , including ross herself do n't get that is beyond me ! over the top ? if anyone saw the original play with jennifer holliday ( i did see it ) then you do n't know the meaning of over the top . that character was supposed to be that way and hudson did a wonderful job of that . her performance overrated ? hogwash ! she deserved all the accolades she received as a novice actress . murphy did one of his best acting jobs ever ! beyonce 's performance was good but not great . this was in part because her character while prominent was not the focus of the movie nor was it of the play . this was beyonce 's best acting performance thus far though she still needs some work and the " right " role . this was not the right role for her in my opinion . hudson 's character is the main and central character which puzzles me for the " supporting actress " win . though as lead actress she probably would have lost . you people out there , do n't take my word for this movie 's greatness and take on a true part of history even if it was " white-washed , " no pun intended . or do n't think its a bad movie like some other critics here . you must judge for yourself . i hope and think that you wo n't be disappointed . there are some more than subtle references to the supremes and diana ross especially in some of the costumes , beyonce 's images and album covers ( cd covers for you youngsters ) but only die hard fans of the supremes and people who were there at that time would know that . enjoy

camera pos 411.txt i looked at this camera the panasonic hvx200 , the sonys , the jvc 200 , and even canon 's bigger brother the x1. i found this one to have fantastic reviews on dvinfo.net , a great video forum . my concerns about 24f vs 24p were addressed to my satisfaction - there really is n't a difference . i like tape vs the hvx 's expensive storage solutions . one concern i had was , will it look like a pro camera ? that is important in some situations where your equipment gives you added credibilty with clients and talent . as soon as i opened the box i was in love ! this is a really substantial camera . especially with the opt wide angle from canon and the matte box provided , this does not look like your mama 's camcorder . i really like the manual controls , so that you do n't have to go thru menus to change parameters . the layout of everything is great . i really like the dual on / off and zoom controls - top of handle plus rear right side . holding the handle for low or medium height shots is very , very comfortable and the controls are perfectly positioned . only down side - and it is incidental . the matte box is a bit flimsy - lightweight plastic . that helps with weight , but i worry about breaking it . some may say that hdv codec is not as good as dvcpro , but my eye does not see it . the colors are magnificent and it blows away many other cams in low-light . if you are looking for point and shoot , this is not your baby , but if you want a pro quality camera for a really great price - this is it

books neg 888.txt i forced myself to finish this book , though it was touch and go in several places , just so i could feel able to review it fairly . it seems i liked it even less than reviewer ms. trieste " cf " , below , but i am in general agreement with her points . there are just so many things wrong with this book that even the grating " famous names " do n't really stand out for me . let 's see , where to begin : the naive political ranting , the unspeakable dialogue , the corny love interest , the wholly implausible technology , the absurd coincidences , the distractingly disjointed structure , the proliferation of minor characters , the talky explanations of the detective 's thought processes , the total incompetence and corruption of the police - i ca n't go on ; it 's hackneyed and poorly written , and that 's all there is to it .
health pos 704.txt well , let 's face it..short of any procedure that is invasive ( botox , cosmetic surgery , etc ) , there really isnt any magic cream that is going to reverse the aging process , but there are a number of products that will aid in improving the look , feel and texture of your face . i 've been trying out several of the products out there , and i found " olay total effects night firming cream for face and neck " to be one of the best ones around . i really like this one alot because of the many benefits it has all in one jar . after using it pretty generously for a little over a month ( i 've used about 1 / 2 the jar so far ) , i found it worked wonders on improving the look and feel of my skin . it minimized the appearance of fine lines , really hydrated my dry skin , improving on firmness , absorbed deep into my skin , so using it every night , i could still feel the softness the next morning , and left my face feeling very smooth to the touch . i especially felt and saw visable result around my neck and throat area ( where i am really starting to get that over 50 look ) . it has a nice , very light scent , and here 's the best part.. . the price here at amazon is about 1 / 2 of what i paid when i purchased it along with my groceries at the market ( and it was even on sale at the store ) , so at around twelve dollars here right now , it 's a real bargain . there are 7 benefits listed on the box , some i mentioned above , others include evening skin tone , minimizes the appearance of pores and reduces the appearance of blotches and age spots . give this one a try for any of these aging signs . do n't expect a miracle . the wrinkles will not vanish , but a nice improvement in the look and feel of your skin , a healthy glow that leaves you feeling just a little better about yourself ( and a a great price ) . the formula includes a fast absorbing skin strengthener called vitaniacin ( vit b3 , vit e and pro-vit b5 ) , wheat protein and hydrators . i like it and recommend it.....laurie

books pos 88.txt over 20 years after it was published , the story of the israeli attempt to eradicate massive and repeated terrorist attacks emanating from the plo ( bubba 's / jacques / un 's buddy yasser ) in lebanon is no less important . interestingly , lebanon is still struggling to rid itself of syrian occupation . they have gone from the vegan dictator hafez assad murdering opponents and journalists to the syrian optometrist dictator murdering opponents and journalists ( another killed last week 7 / 2005 ) . in this review , i will attempt to explain the story , the left-wing / doves reporter 's views ( and on so many levels his mistakes ) , and most importantly to americans who love and support israel , the correlation between israel 's actions and our " war on terror . " first to the journalists , the main one being the left wing newspaper haraatz ze'ev schiff . as the brilliant reviewer givbatam3 points out nearby , mr. schiff is a member of the israeli left / dove / peace now group . this " coalition " consists of myopic people ( with all due respect ) that do n't seem to understand good and evil . just as our great president bush was criticized for denouncing the " axis of evil " ( he forgot to mention syria and the house of saud ) , these doves conveniently choose to ignore the problems with cooperating with our / their enemies . this is what lead to the fraudulent oslo accords and the creation of the terrorist supporting palestinian authority . it is this " authority " that unleashed a wave of terror on israel immediately after clinton helped the murderer arafat receive a nobel peace prize . fittingly , arafat walked away from the clinton / barak plan in 2000 , which would have created a palestinian state , which to this day ( 7.8.05 ) does not exist despite the charade of the road map . the authors accuse prime minister sharon of illegally leading israel into the war in lebanon . most of the books i 've read about israel seem to have been written by journalists out to discredit sharon . he seems to be the donald rumsfeld of israel . i do n't live there so it is impossible for me to get a read on the situation , but he was democratically elected , so most of the voters must disagree with the left 's assessment of mr. sharon ( yes , i know his " disengagement " is an illegal abomination , more on that later . wear orange to support the settlers . ) on page 39 , mr. ze'ev describes sharon as " a cynical , headstrong executor who regarded the idf as his personal tool for obtaining sweeping achievements-and not necessarily defensive ones-and a minister prepared to stake the national interest on his struggle for power . " those would prove to be the " kindest " words he would have for mr. sharon . on page 58 , he accuses sharon of implementing a quasi-coup d'etat . and on and on it goes . the author also accuses sharon of duping the american government , details forthcoming . later on , we learn of the " courageous , freedom fighter " ( my emphasis ) arafat 's decision to deploy all palestinians including 12 year old boys to kill israelis . of course , to this day the pa affiliated fatah and other groups use children to murder israeli civilians ( the best non-child attack recently was the palestinian woman who was granted permission to receive medical care in israel who tried to kill innocent israeli doctors / nurses using " bomber pants . " great video of her discovering the bomb would n't activate , however us msm {mainstream media} other than fox refused to air it . ) on page 92 , we learn of arafat crony and current pa leader abu mazen 's ( the same oslo and road map violating , terrorist supporting / enabling , holocaust denying , chain-smoking mazen that gw brazenly brought to the white house ) recommendation to target specific ethnic types of jews for murder . throughout the story , if indeed the cabinet was mislead , we learn that this deception had negative military preparedness consequences . specifically , a failure to call up the reserves . to his credit and unlike journalists robert fisk ( pity the nation ) and thomas friedman ( ny times , from lebanon to jerusalem ) , mr. schiff reminds us of the level of terror practiced by ray-ban wayfarer wearing arafat even inside his own plo . on page 147 , we learn of palestinians killing palestinians that were given the chance to evacuate an area prior to idf action . in this episode , three children were gunned down in front of their father . on page 149 , the authors engage in a disgusting bit of analysis about the minds of idf members . in discussing a particularly brutal phase of the operation , the author 's ask " was it perhaps fueled by an even deeper sense of vengeance for all the harm and hatred that the jews had suffered at the hands of others over the centuries ? " and further , " how would the grandparents of these boys have reacted to the scene of mayhem.. . ? " are you kidding me ? ? these members of the citizen army were probably quite sick of repeated murders of innocent israeli citizens and committed to seeing their country living in peace . meanwhile , the un , the left / doves , the media , and others seemed to downplay or turn a blind eye to arafat 's involvement in the many terrorist attacks conducted by the plo prior to the lebanon operation . in my humble view , something had to be done . prime minister begin agreed with sharon 's initial plan on eliminating the terrorists in beirut . page 152 features more america bashing , culminating in an accusation that the us was an israeli dupe . the story of the military operation is detailed completely . and no discussion of the lebanon operation would be complete without mentioning the incidents in the refugee camps in sabrit and shatilla . i 'll leave it for the reader to decide on this operation , but in short , israel relied on their " allies " in lebanon to rid the camps of terrorists . most assuredly , after the palestinians brought havoc to these people , they wanted revenge . the result : some civilian deaths to go along with the " clean up " operation and a rebuke of several israeli figures including prime minister sharon . folks , war is not pretty and the us faced similar choices in partnering with the northern alliance in afghanistan . many to this day say that is why we allegedly " lost " bin laden in tora bora instead of adequately deploying our troops on the pakistan border . general tommy franks says this would not have been possible and i believe him more than the kerry / kedwards crowd . our " ally " pakistan would not have tolerated a us presence , given that they were one of only three governments with relations with the taliban . as for the author 's attempts to rid israeli society of prime minister sharon , it did n't work . he forcefully fought the charges emanating from the investigation into the lebanon operation . after yasser walked all over clinton in barak in 2000 and launched / restarted the intifada , israel voted for " arik " and his platform of not negotiating with arafat . sadly , no tragically , he is haphazardly implementing his " disengagement plan . " six weeks prior to its start , it appears the plan is not well thought out and polls show that israelis are increasingly against it . moreover , turning land over to terrorist supporting mazen will embolden those that seek israel 's destruction . israel expects terror gangs of hamas , islamic jihad , and mazen 's own fatah to immediately set up shop in the west bank and begin terror operations . so looking back mr. schiff and ya'ari , who was right ? terror coddling doves such as rabin ( who at least acknowledged the danger in trusting arafat ) and peres or likud hawks such as sharon ( and netanyahu ) ? let the reader decide . i know who i would trust with my security : likud members sharon and netanyahu .
books pos 364.txt dave barry has written and selected an extremely humorous collection of his articles from the miami herald . there is a huge margin in difference of quality in boogers are my beat than in his initial non fiction books such as dave barry 's bad habits . boogers are my beat is one of those rare books that once you start turning the pages you do n't want to put down until the back cover . dave barry educates his fellow man on a diverse range of topics such as why you ca n't use the towels hanging in the bathroom , the salt lake city olympics , babies on airlines , north dakota , bear in the big blue house and cell phones to name just a few . his article written the day after september 11 and one written a year after , about the philadelphia crashed plane are also included which prove barry could have been a serious writer if he had pursued that career . thankfully he did n't because the rest of the book is hysterically funny as is his carl hiaasen style fiction novel tricky business . big trouble is n't bad either . check them out along with his other non fiction novels as well .

books neg 309.txt if you like this book you will probably like " bless the child " by cathy cash spellman . they are very similar . this book can be summed up in one word , simple : simple-minded , simple characters , simple plot ( applied loosely ) , and simple premise . what a contrived piece of garbage ! i ca n't describe everything wrong with this book because there 's not enough time . if it 's meant to be a mystery it sucks because you figure out who did it about halfway through . if it 's meant to empower women it sucks because the women are either victims , in denial , weak , worried about what everyone thinks , or oblivious . if it 's meant to promote animal adoptions it sucks because the author 's plea for that is irritating . that 's how bad this book is ! it can make an animal lover say that its plea for more animal adoptions was annoying . this author has no style . the book reads like an episode of inside edition . there is no immersion into the story . the total lack of character development leaves you with no compassion for them . as a reader i felt completely outside the story ; an uncaring observer of a poorly described scenario . the attempts to tug at my heartstrings were laughable . i 've been more moved by the appearance of colorful weeds on my lawn . the only reason i read the whole thing was that my neighbor recommended it and loaned it to me . do not waste your time . i must say though that this novel was inspirational . if this crap can make the best seller list , it gives me hope that my original fiction might get published

camera neg 115.txt this camera worked very well until the lens got jammed in its extended position . i sent the camera for warranty service ( i had it less than 7 months ) , and they refused to honor the warranty because it was a bit scuffed and a little decorative ring on the end of the lens that had been attached with 2-sided tape had come off . they claimed this happened due to physical damage , but this occurred during normal use : i was just changing modes and the lens did n't retract . do n't bother trying to get warranty service unless the unit looks brand new . even then , do n't be surprised if they renege on the warranty . i had another a410 that did the very same thing ( lens got jammed ) , but was stolen in a break-in before i sent it out for service ( so i suppose it was no loss after all ) . obviously there is a design flaw that causes the lens to extend too far and come off track inside . in short , this camera is not suitable for frequent use in the field . if you buy it , and plan to use it a lot , expect to be buying another camera or paying for a repair that should be covered under warranty ( which i 'm not doing ) soon .
dvd neg 993.txt running with scissors is a slice of life movie which spends time leering into the lives of eccentrics and then ends with no revelations or culminating event . unfortunately what comes before the movie fails to culminate is not very profound or insightful . it is marginally entertaining and somewhat troubling . the lead character in the movie is a 15-year old . his parents divorce , and his selfish mother sends him to live with her charlatan psychoanalyst and his similarly-acquired family . lead is on course to become a writer ( who eventually writes the non-fiction account upon which this movie is based ) , but we see little of his efforts to develop himself as a writer . all the performances were serviceable , save for gwyneth paltrow , who lazily regurgitates a role she played previously . annette benning is also essentially revisiting a role she played in a better movie . mrs. benning performed excellently and selflessly , but the similarity of the roles intruded on my view of the movie . it is a sure sign that hollywood is producing too many dysfunctional family flicks when all actors have been consigned to act in them and some actors are serving a second term . also growing tiresome is the treatment of gays in movies . the presence of one or more characters has become a requirement in films that explore a set of quirky characters . furthermore , the gays are stereotypically endowed with greater passion and depth of emotion , and are put-upon or stifled by the stodgy straights . the most promising characters are the psychoanalyst 's wife and adopted daughter . the movie has some colorful and funny scenes , but these are not enough to justify a viewing

books pos 208.txt this is an essential read for anyone who wants a deeper understand of american foreign policy . a year after this book was published , there were over a hundred reviews . regardless of whiether one disagrees or agrees with the author , finds the author right or wrong , interesting or boring , this book is one of the most influential books , if not the most influential book that affected american foreign policy . in fact , the current bush adminstration 's policies , george kenan 's containment , henry kissinger 's policies as well as countless adminstration 's policies are shaped or affected by this book . my area of study is the foreign policy of post world war two american governments , and never have i understood it with greater clarity after i read this book . it is the thread which runs through the policies of all the administrations , differing on extent . ( i studied the policies first and read the book the year after ) . it is a fascinating book and hard to put down . the author writes in a european style ( beautiful long sentences , etc. ) , which in my opinion makes it more eloquent and in the opinion of my co-students makes it more difficut to read . he tries to give a balanced perspective from which one can think critically . ms. rice and mr. kissinger were heavily influenced by this book . to understand them , this is a must read . in and of itself , it is an excellent book , a classic , and thousands others significantly more qualified than i have reviewed it . look even at other reviews on this website or at well known journals for a more accurate assement of the book itself by political scientists

music pos 751.txt i agree with everyone else ; the music on this album is completely magical . two masters at work with a great rhythm section , very spontaneous-sounding contrapuntal harmonies , unbounded joy in every tune , and some interesting arrangements . this is also the worst-sounding cd ( or lp , for that matter ) that i have ever heard . it sounds worse than lo-res mp3s played over the web ; i have recordings of 78s that sound better . i cannot believe that even laserlight would release this . i have other laserlight cds and none of them sound this bad . if they remastered this and made it sound better , i would buy it again . that 's the only reason for 4 stars rather than 5. still , it 's worth getting if you can listen past the horrible sound quality
health neg 524.txt this dryer made my wavy hair straighter than a seperate brush and dryer ever could . the problem is that it just shuts off . the first time i used it , it shut off twice within a 20-minute period . it would n't restart when i plugged it back in , or even when i tried a different outlet . no matter what i tried , it would n't restart for about 5 minutes . i 've used an older model of this dryer and the same thing happened . i would n't recommend buying this product
books pos 638.txt i teared when i read parts of the book , but it is such an awesome book ! i did n't want to put that book down until i was completely finished reading it . i definetely recommend it to anyone with children . i loved it , and i plan on keeping up with my letter box to my son
